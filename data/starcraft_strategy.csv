Getting better at this game is partly a choice. It's a choice of how much time you budget into practicing, and how much time you budget into the game in general.

Yes, laddering is good. Analyzing replays is good. Submitting replays to /r/starcraft_strategy to get higher level analysis of your replays is good.

However, better than all of that, is having a group of people you can talk to anytime, anyday.

Did you just ladder and lose to some sort of all-in that makes you go ""omg protoss so imba!!!"" and want to know how to beat it? Do you just want to talk out some strategy you've been thinking of with someone without the time-lag that a subreddit or forum has?

That's what our TeamSpeak server provides.

In an instant, you can connect with a practice partner. You can connect to a Masters player who's been there before. You can talk about the tournament going on during the weekend, play-by-play with someone who knows the reasons for what the pros are doing (yes, casters can be wrong).

The possibilities of improvement and fun are endless. 

Peepmodes, tournament viewing, starcraftcirclejerking, coaching, discussion, customs, Counter Strike, Left 4 Dead, stream viewing.

I encourage all of you, whether you are just starting out in Bronze league or just got promoted in Masters, to join in on the server. There are good times to be had, and promotions to acquire.

Without further ado, the TeamSpeak server is: **server.valdegames.com**

ALSO, make sure to use the ""Starcraft Strategy"" in-game channel!

**tl;dr**: Getting better is having people to talk to instantaneously, so come join myself and others on server.valdegames.com. I look forward to seeing you there.

1326088852.0,69,self.starcraft_strategy,o8z1z,"Enough of the ""Macro Better""",packrat386,119,50,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/o8z1z/enough_of_the_macro_better/,"Moved this to the top because I don't want people to misunderstand this.

Please note that I think macro is a hugely important factor at all levels, quite possibly the most important thing in the game. I just don't think its useful advice to disregard the original question of a lower league player and tell them to simply focus on macro.


Now

Answers to posts on the strategy forum are getting ridiculously one dimensional. If the poster mentions that they are anything below platinum the top comment will almost certainly be something along the lines of ""You don't need to worry about this, just learn how to macro""

I think this approach is flawed for a few reasons

1) People play at this level for fun - Bronze or silver level players may only play a couple of times a week but they do try to enjoy themselves. When most people play they want to improve all the aspects of their play. They will probably want to work on their macro as part of the plan, but nobody really enjoys just massing up a bunch of unit because they think can make more units than the other guy. Unit combinations and strategic choices do make the game interesting even at a low level of play.

2) Sometimes it isn't the problem - There are plenty of cases where a player can far out macro their opponent and still lose even at low levels of play. A zerg player who masses a ton of zerglings will still lose to a terran player with tanks even if he is making zerglings off of 4 or 5 bases at once. Macro that is better than your opponent  != auto win. To any top player who says things like ""I made it out of platinum with just macro"" I can assure you that your choice of what unit to make a bunch of was informed by a superior knowledge of unit combinations and positioning

3) Its anti educational - Telling lower level players to disregard all other aspects of the game can only make it harder for them to learn these things later. Even if the ""macro better"" approach would get them out of gold league, they'll just be stuck with the same problem at a higher level i.e. they won't know about unit combinations or timings. Helping now means they can incorporate those concepts into their training for their mechanics

4) Everyone already knows - I can pretty much guarantee that there are no bronze league players that think that their macro is impeccable and that the only thing keeping them out of GM is unit combos, and if they do exist then they wouldn't be looking here for advices. Low level players understand that macro will help them win games, you aren't helping them because you only provide information they already know.

EDIT - Spelling + Grammar

EDIT 2 - I don't want to have to make this reply to all of the many comments it replies to so here it is. If someone asks an open ended question like ""How do I get better"" then telling them to improve their macro is a valid (and possibly the best) suggestion. This was intended to for the context of specific questions such as ""How do I beat mass colossi as zerg"" where the poster is looking for advice that only applies to a specific game or games where he or she lost to that unit combination.

We're all in this subreddit because we want to get better, so here are a few thoughts that are poison to improvement:

1.) _____ is imba, thus I lost because of the game's current state

-unless you lose every single matchup you play against whatever race you have trouble with, chances are the reason you lost is because the person you played outplayed you AND because *YOU* made mistakes

2.) I played this perfectly, why did I lose?

-Those two items should never reside in the same sentence, you do not play perfectly and lose, just accept it.

3.) I think I played pretty well, why did I lose?

-because you didn't play well, that's why you lost. These should all read, I played poorly, can you help me determine what mistakes I made that were the most costly so I can work on improving?

SC2 is one of the most beautiful, balanced games in the world, and the reason I love it so much resides in that truth. The races are different, but can beat each other in any given matchup *IF PLAYED WELL*.

If you make up excuses that aren't between the ears or on the keyboard and mouse you're creating a detrimental environment for improvement. Blaming the game removes blame from yourself, and means that you're as good as you should be, *it's just the games fault*.

You will never, ever improve if this is the case. Buckle down and allow for some introspective criticism. Go back and watch your own replay before posting it here, I do, and you know what I see? 

Countless supply blocks, missing SCVs, floating too much gas, missing production cycles and upgrades, misinterpreting scouting information, not maintaining map awareness, lack of acceptable micro, but also I see improvement from last week in all of those areas, because those are my key points I work on. These make me mad, losing makes me even more upset. I don't ""rage"" persay, because it would be just raging against myself, but I do get very annoyed with myself. I'm not saying be robotic about it, but let that feeling of ""wow I got owned by _______"" make you work a little bit harder in a micro trainer, or practice one game more against a friend.

Never blame the game, blaming the game assumes it's not your fault, and it is.

If it's your fault when you lose, but if you accept all that responsibility and pressure and acceptance of blame, it makes winning all the more sweeter, because you know what? That faceless dude on the other side of the internet, you beat him, the game didn't, you did. You were soundly better in most, if not all, phases of the game, because you worked on it and improved.

These tips are not by any means pro tips (in fact, they will probably help a developing player). I made a quick list off the top of my head so please feel free to comment with more or ask questions. Thanks

-Don't build any infestors until your Pathogen Upgrade is 30 seconds into the research timing. I see many people just kind of wing it around the halfway mark. Its 50 seconds to build an infestor and 80 seconds for the upgrade. (You can check timing by hovering over the bar the tracks how much time has elapsed into the research). This ensres that every infestor pops with a healthy amount of energy (aka enough for a fungal right off its uh ""birth"")

-To efficiently spread creep fast, do NOT select every tumor 1 by 1 and creep. Instead, control click a creep tumor (to select all near by ones) and c+click where you want to lay creep tumors down. 

-Is you fast expo getting denied? If your going hatch first build (I normally do against all t or p) try to fake a gas + pool build. When you see the scout coming into your base and you hatch has not started construction, fake a gas + pool build by building an extractor. This usually leads to the opponent registering in his head that fast expo probably isn't coming. Send your drone to build the hatch now and cancel your gas. Another trick I like to do if my overlord scouts a scout coming (lol) I hide a drone relatively close to my ramp and once his scout enters my base, I take the hidden drone, ninja my way out of my base and build the hatch.

-Cross-positions on a map allows you to stay very macro-orientated because spines can usually finish if you are actively scouting the enemy army until he moves out. (Having a small group of lings run in the moment he moves out also gives you more time to prepare a defense and usually does good damage)

-Saturation of mineral patches is VERY important. Being able to visually recognize the optimum 2 worker per patch makes it easy for you to understand when to slow worker production and/or expand. Also its okay to overproduce some drones if you are expanding soon or your expo hatch is already in the makes to quickly transfer and get optimum gather time. 

-When you throw down a spire and want to make maximum amount of mutas RIGHT when it hatches, do not spend any gas while the spire is building. Instead let your gas constantly build and try to use just the right amount of minerals to allow a perfect 1 to 1 ratio of mineral and gas when the mutas pop. For instance, lets say you have 1000/500. Use those floating minerals on overlords, drones, and zerglings. If your spire is almost done, use minerals until you are... lets say 200/500. Then by the time your spire pops, you should be an even 600/600. (Mineral obviously collects at a faster rate). Another thing to keep in mind is DON'T GET SUPPLY BLOCKED or USE TOO MANY LARVA BEFORE. I have face palmed so many times because of these two issues.

This would be done on a stream.

There was also an idea to run a big Peepmode (stream this as well)  and have lower level players play and have a coach of their race talk to them during/after the game.

Someone just asked me for advice on how to get to Diamond from Plat, and in general I see a lot of people on this subreddit who are trying to promote up to Masters. As someone who started in Plat, got promoted to Diamond relatively easily, and struggled to get a promotion to Masters for about a year, I know the negative feelings and frustration that can come in. You feel like you'll never make it, you get more anxiety to play 1v1 because every loss takes you farther from your goals, and then you play worse because of the anxiety.  
  
But back up a second and think: promotion is not about emotion. Promotion is about getting better and winning a majority of games against people in your league and around 50% of games in the next league up. If you want to make Masters, you have to prove you beat Diamonds the majority of the time and Masters a lot of the time.  
  
Macroing better is the by far the easiest and fastest way to improve your play and to win games. I still lose many games because my macro messed up and I am mid-Masters now. I don't want to belabor this introduction any more, so let's talk about WHY macro is so important. To learn HOW to macro better, see this explanation: http://www.gosubuilds.com/guides/explaining-how-to-macro-better/ 
  
1. **Macroing well allows you to pick safer builds.**  
If you know you can outmacro opponents in your league, strategically you want to push games into macro mode. The best way to do this is to pick safe builds, which will improve your win-rate against cheese AND will encourage your opponent to macro against you. This puts the ball in your court, whereas if you pick a greedy strategy you open the door for cheese and all-ins to prevent your macro ability from kicking in.  
  
2. **Macroing well makes battles easier**  
If two players have equally powerful armies, things like positioning, multitask, engagement control, map awareness, and so forth become really important. However, the more shit you have than your opponent, the less you have to control perfectly. This takes a lot of pressure off of you to get the sickest fungal/storm/emp/concave and should help you win battles a lot more consistently.  
  
3. **Macro applies in all situations**  
Let's say you and your opponent both get into really odd situations. Perhaps you cheese each other and shit gets into uncharted waters. In these situations, you might not have a good ""sense"" of what's going on or who is ahead, whereas you might in a normal situation if you are a very intellectual player. Macroing well, on the other hand, helps you no matter the game situation.  
  
4. **Macroing well helps you learn more about the game**  
If you macro properly, you will start to understand ""timing attacks"" and your play will be a lot more similar to professional play. If you can't make SCVs properly, you will never be able to hit the timings Bomber or Taeja does because your fundamentals are simply not supportive of your strategic understanding.  
  
5. **Macroing well allows you to think about other things**  
In the end, if you are focusing on macro for a couple months, you are going to get really good and fast at macro. You will just automatically produce overlords or depots without really thinking about it. This frees up your mind to think about the scouting intel you just got, to look at the mini map, to look at your money, etc. If you are focused on putting guys into gas or making SCVs, you will lose mind-time that could be spent on many other things. Muscle memory is key to macroing well and to playing well.  
  
Hope these reasons to macro well will convince you to improve your macro and help you get that promotion. ",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,race-z,True,t3_119lko,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/119lko/5_ways_macroing_well_will_get_you_promoted/,
1337843481.0,51,self.starcraft_strategy,u2fgh,A new way at approaching opening builds for bronze-plat players: The Advantage System,NoseKnowsAll,60,9,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/u2fgh/a_new_way_at_approaching_opening_builds_for/,"Hey - just for some background, I'm a mid masters terran player (and diamond zerg and low diamond toss...whatever), and I'm the head coach for the bronze through gold /r/starcraft_strategy coaching sessions (usually) held every saturday.  *Insert shameless plug for upcoming coaching session [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/u1e4c/coaching_and_improvement_session_7/)*.  Recently, I've been trying to figure out how to help players understand their openers without sitting over their shoulder and reminding them to get that techlab on time and to continue building probes constantly.

What I've come up is what I like to call: ""**The Advantage System**""

The advantage system is a way of assessing your opening build and then coming up with a way to remember the important parts of the build so that you execute it correctly even if you are not executing it perfectly.  Obviously, if you're diamond+ and can execute builds up to the 10 minute mark perfectly then don't bother reading on unless you want to help other lower league players out.

Starcraft 2 is a game that plays out after players have chosen which advantages they want their opener to have.  The three advantages are as follows:

(1) **Economy**

(2) **Tech**

(3) **Army**

Any good opening build, then, has two advantages, and sacrifices the third in order to power those two advantages more.

**Example 1: 1rax FE -&gt; 3rax+reactored starport TvX**.  This build gets a very fast command center and then powers hard into getting the important bio upgrades and medivacs.  The advantages to this build are economy and tech, while it sacrifices having a large army until much later (This is why holding allins is really hard to do - your army is just a bunch of random marines cowering inside/near a bunker until your economy kicks in).

**Example 2: 3gate void PvT allin**.  The advantages of this build are both army and tech, while you sacrifice an economy (you stay on only one base with 24ish probes) in order to do it.  This is why if you don't do damage with this push, a terran player will have the economy necessary to roll over you in a standard followup attack.

**Example 3: 1gate FE -&gt; 3gate DTs PvT**.  This build's advantages are economy and tech, sacrificing army until much later.

**Example 4: FFE -&gt; 6gate PvZ**.  This build's advantages are economy and army, sacrificing tech until much later.

**Example 5: 1/1/1 TvP**.  This build's advantages are army and tech, sacrificing economy entirely.

**Example 6: 1rax FE-&gt; combat shields push OR 1rax FE-&gt; 6rax no gas TvP**.  Both these builds get economy and army, while sacrificing tech until much later.

You might now be saying - ""Great, I can now identify which two advantages any build in SC2 has.  How exactly is this helpful to me as a bronze-plat player?""  Well the answer is that once you've identified which two advantages your build has, when you are performing that build order in a game, ***YOU HAVE TO BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE ADVANTAGES*** given to you.

For instance, when you 1 rax FE, the most important thing you have to be doing is constantly building scvs.  Once of the advantages of the build is that you get a strong economy, but if you're not constantly building scvs then one of the advantages of the build is instantly gone.  Likewise - if you delay your tech too much with this build (say, by forgetting gas or not placing your factory down on time) then you will again be removing one of the advantages this build is supposed to give you.  It's totally fine to miss a marine here or there (this build doesn't give you army anyway) as long as you are building those workers like crazy and being precise with your factory timing.

Likewise - when you 1/1/1 in TvP, it's totally ok for you to miss an scv or two while you're doing the build - economy is not part of the advantages this build gives you.  However, if you're not constantly building out of those 3 buildings or forgetting to swap your techlab onto your starport in time, then your tech will be delayed and your army is not going to be big enough for the allin you're preparing to do - no doubt losing you the game.

So now - to all you bronze-platinum players out there who aren't 100% perfect with building scvs/probes or making units out of your gateways/barracks, I want you to do the following:

1) Identify the two advantages your build gives you before you start your next game.  If it doesn't give you two advantages or it's too middle of the road (a reason I believe that 3gate FE in PvT and PvZ is dead), then find a new build.

2) Take advantage of the advantages your build gives you.  Don't stress too much over the third advantage in SC2 that your build doesn't give you, but you better be striving for perfection with the two advantages you have.  

3) Review the game and see how well you took advantage of the natural advantages your build gave you.  Try to find a way to improve on your advantage taking if it's not perfect.

**TL;DR**: SC2 is a game with three advantages: Economy, Tech, and Army.  All good build orders take advantage of two of these.  In game, don't miss scvs for economy builds, don't forget gas/tech for tech builds, and frickin' attack at the correct timings for army builds.

**Final remarks**: Feel free to ask any questions here; I'll be checking this in the upcoming days until Red Bull Battlegrounds.  I'm not sure exactly how this applies to zerg players, for they don't exactly have ""builds"" per se.  However - for allins such as the roach/bling/ling allin, you can clearly see that it is an army/tech build.

As Racemic below noted: ""It's so important to not only understand what the strengths and weaknesses of your own build are, but also to be able to compare your build to other builds, so that you know how to TRANSITION. If you have an economic and tech advantage but he has a bigger army/less economy, you should play SAFE until your economy kicks in and equalizes the army.""  I would suggest this to all players who fully understand their own build orders now.  Try scouting out what your opponent is doing and categorize his build according to the advantage system too.  Then you can react accordingly knowing that you have a better advantage in one category and disadvantage in another.

Example: You are 1rax FE'ing (eco/tech) vs a 3gate void allin (army/tech).  You have an advantage in eco and a disadvantage in army.  Thus - defend his push with more bunkers/scvs in order to deal with his army, and then eventually you will be able to take advantage of your eco advantage and win the game.",,False,,t5_2smn2,1337916225.0,,,True,t3_u2fgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/u2fgh/a_new_way_at_approaching_opening_builds_for/,

I know this not technically a ""strategy"" topic, but I thought I would provide you the resources that I have found invaluable to ensure I can play 3+ hours straight without getting stress injuries. Here's what I've learned:  
  
-Exercise really helps you play better. It actually helps in longer games because adrenaline surges and just sheer focus can tire you out if you are out of shape. Also, I find it's much easier to focus if after 3-4 games, I take a break and do some light cardio for 2-3 minutes so my heart rate is up. This pumps blood everywhere, including your wrist, ass, legs, and helps your circulation in general. For Fitness, I would recommend going over to r/Fitness and reading the FAQ. 
  
-**Wrist health**: http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/eh1tb/please_send_help_coder_lifter_with_evertighter/c181mg6  
  
-**ergonomics**: http://www.nismat.org/ptcor/ergo/desk_layout.jpg  
Personally, I have a Tempur Pedic $300 chair and it was the single biggest factor I've changed to make playing long sessions more manageable.  http://www.staples.com/Tempur-Pedic-TP8000-Ergonomic-Mesh-Mid-Back-Task-Chair-Black/product-nr_324599
  
-**Performance Enhancement**: Personally, caffeine makes me play slightly faster and alcohol makes me play with less inhibition, which is to say worse. I wouldn't recommend 1v1ing while drunk, but to each their own. I know that some people have used Ritalin, Adderol, and other compounds to help them play. I would never recommend that to anyone who doesn't have a prescription because you can a develop dependency on those drugs, not to mention it's illegal to take drugs that aren't yours in the US (not sure about other countries).  
  
-**Ladder Anxiety**: This has been the single greatest factor limiting my own play. It has come and gone - there have been periods in life where I could play without limits, and others where 2 or 3 games would make me too nervous and mad to play anymore. I honestly think it'd be impossible to give you one piece of advice for fixing this because I am sure there are a dozen different reasons for getting ladder anxiety and rage.  
  
For me, here are some things that help combat this:  
-Happier life situation in general  
-Don't think about opponent, just think about yourself and how to improve your own play  
-Practice macro against AI every day for 30 minutes you will improve a lot and also I think this helps you to realize that the game has so many things to improve on.  
-You can try to brute force your rage/anxiety and just say ""This is not helping me get better."" but generally I find it's better to acknowledge your emotions, not try to manhandle them. Might be different for you honeybadgers out there.  
-Try not to wrap up any self-worth in your ladder ranking. It's really hard to do for me, but really no one cares if I'm Platinum, Diamond, or Wood League.

So I often help out my lower league Zerg buddies with strategy from time to time, and a constant mistake I see often is that players get gas too early when they don't need it.  It may seem like a minor mistake, but the effects of delaying gas until you need it are quite large.

How large? I didn't know myself, but I crunched some rough numbers to figure this out.

Assume you have 5 minutes until you need to get gas (let's say you have 1 geyser up already and mining, but want to delay a second).  If you opt to build drones and mine minerals instead of building that geyser now, this is the cost in 5 minutes:

* 3 drones mining gas - 600 gas over 5 minutes, mining rate of 120 gas/minute
* 3 drones mining minerals, constantly build new drones with that income, and putting new drones on minerals too - your 3 drones will have turned into 17 drones after 5 minutes, with a mining rate of about 700 minerals/minute

So that one measly extra geyser you got has a huge opportunity cost on your economy!  That's almost 1 full base worth of saturation per geyser.

This is obviously a simplistic portrayal. Things like base saturation and what not come into play.  But it's a good illustration just how costly getting gas that is unnecessary, can hurt your economy in the early game when your main goal is to drone as hard as possible.",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_qj2p8,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/qj2p8/zerg_macro_the_benefits_of_delaying_gas/,

It's now been 1 month since Heart of the Swarm was released, and I hope you all agree with me when I say: ""Wow - what a great month it's been.""  So I decided to just do a month re-cap of everything that's happened at GosuBuilds.

We uploaded a grand-total of 21 builds in just over 30 days.  All of them can be viewed [here](http://www.gosubuilds.com/new-hots-builds/).  We had a guest submitter, Slur, write up [Polt's 2rax Reaper FE](http://www.gosubuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvt/tvt-2rax-reaper-fe/), and another guest submitter, Modest, write up [MKP's 1/1/1 all-in](http://www.gosubuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvt/tvt-mkps-111-all-in/).  Unfortunately, no Protoss or Zerg guest submitters have stepped up to the plate, but I've definitely talked to some guys out there (you all know who you are) and I couldn't have done some of the builds without you.  Thanks for that :D

Now let's look at what we're looking to do going forward.  

* More builds!
* More builds!
* Get some pro replays of more builds!

The problem I'm having, simply put, is that I can't find any new HotS builds out there that seem standard enough to post about.  This is why I'm looking for your guys' help on this matter.  **If any of you get your hands on some pro (basically Code A or Code S) replays/VODs of standard builds that are or are not already uploaded to GosuBuilds, please let me know - I'd be super appreciative of it.**  

Here are some builds that I know exist, but haven't seen a pro execute repetitively, so have been unable to write-up a good build for:

* gasless 1rax FE vs Protoss that's actually safe vs oracles
* normal 1gate FE vs Terran that isn't ridiculously weak to either reaper opener or widow mine drop
* any standard ZvT build at all
* voidray all-in in PvT
* FFE into stargate in PvZ
* phoenix build in PvP
* gasless 1rax FE into 2 base hellbat drop vs Zerg

If there are others here that I failed to mention, let me know in the comments.  Again, thanks so much for everything this month has brought us!

I check this sub out all the time and really enjoy reading strategy discussions. Here's a couple of pointers that were milestones for me (aside from the obvious MACRO BETTER NOOBS):

 - Learn to quickly count drone saturation - this is so useful for Zerg as it turns droning from an art into a science. Box-select your mineral drones, and if you grab queens or overlords, ctrl-click on a drone icon - you should have 2 rows (16 drones)

 - HOTKEYS MAKE YOU GOSU. Remap 9 to ~ and use it as a hotkey too. As Zerg when you make units, ctrl-click on the egg icons and shift-hotkey them to the appropriate group. So I go INJECT, Select Larvae-&gt; Overlords, Select Larvae -&gt; Make Lings -&gt; SHIFT+1,  Select Larvae -&gt; Make Infestors -&gt; SHIFT + 2. I hear see people rallying hatcheries to units in their army all the time, I think this is silly. Control group them as you make them and now you are in GSL Code S.

 - I get really affected by nerves and I think it's fair to say a lot of people do. Swallow your nerves and shit out cold steel, you're not fighting against computers, intimidate your opponents. Get out on the map and flex nuts. In ling-bane wars, once you have speed, fight tooth and nail all the way to your opponent's base. But don't miss injects or you will lose.

- Lategame Zerg - throw down a ton of extra hatches, it makes the whole race more forgiving of missed injects. Toss and Terran already throw down extra gates and orbitals, Z has a pretty unforgiving larvae mechanic and mass lategame macro hatches can let you focus on not letting your broods get lonely and die.

Those are just a couple, and they're all for Z, feel free to chime in :D

EDIT: Just fking get burrow. **Get burrow every game.** Even if you don't use it, get in the habit of always getting burrow. I haven't messed with burrowed banes but a single burrowed ling denying their expo for 20-30 seconds is arguably already worth the entire investment 100/100.

This will be how the overall event will be run:

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

• Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""

• Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes)

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available [here](www.teamspeak.com). Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is server.valdegames.com

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Lastly, streams will likely be available. My stream can be found at: [ www.twitch.tv/iechozz ](www.twitch.tv/iechozz)

Feel free to join me and others on TeamSpeak at: server.valdegames.com

Thanks all, and I hope to see you there.

P.S. – A few people suggested we use Mumble instead of TeamSpeak. The reason we are sticking with TeamSpeak is because my friend is willing to host a server 24/7 on TS, mumble vs. TS makes almost no difference, and more people have TS than mumble in my experience.

**Do** watch the game from your opponent's perspective as well as your own.    
**Do** watch it first quickly at 4x or 8x to pick up on general themes.    
**Do** focus on the first mistake you made, as this one influences the entirety of the match.  
**Do** watch your Queens/CCs/Nexuses for macro.  
**Do** check your money and supply constantly to see if you're getting supply blocked or piling up resources.  
**Do** watch your larva/rax/gateways to see if you are constantly producing or if there is inactivity.
  
**Don't** nitpick over micro; it has far less weight than macro.  
**Don't** obsess about your APM. As MrLlamaSC as shown, you can win in Masters with 50-60 apm.  
**Don't** look at the very end of the game and identify a reason for losing; usually the match was decided much earlier than the end.  
**Don't** be too hard on yourself. SC2 is really fucking hard and the last thing you need is more pressure and anxiety.  
**Don't** be afraid to admit you don't know something and ask others about it. However, make sure that person knows what they are talking about...

1323228111.0,38,self.starcraft_strategy,n3f2q,ZVZ play tips that I've learned from a zerg ridden ladder,glabius,41,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/n3f2q/zvz_play_tips_that_ive_learned_from_a_zerg_ridden/,"I've played a LOT of zvz at diamond level and I've gotten quite good at it its my best MU at around ~~60% so here's some things I think anyone below diamond could learn from (i would expect high diamond/masters to know most of this)

1. Banelings are your friend, don't blind open roach (some situations no banes is okay) but don't shy away from banelings because they're micro intensive, you need to learn how to use them to be good at early game zvz. Try to get 4+ lings for each bane, and try to keep banes at your base for defense. If you can get a 5+ ling hit from one baneling that can win you the early game. Also during a lingbling war always check corners of your base for secret banes.

2. Tal'Darim always open banelings. I prefer a 13/13 instead of a 14/14 on tal darim because you get them slightly faster and it should be intense. There is no ramp at main so banelings are extra effective (its harder to block banes through a choke etc. without a ramp so banelings are ALWAYS what you should open with on taldarim

3. Two ways can easily put you ahead simply with a drone scout, some don't necessarily need a scout (taldarim, shattered//meta//antiga if you can get an overlord there) but on shakuras or sometimes the other maps you need to be worried about cheese. Send a 9 or 10 drone scout and look for the pool timing. They are either

a. 6-10 pooling, if you see this drop your pool ASAP (probably at 12/13 /14 drones) or if its overlord scout and you catch it quick on meta or shattered, drop it a drone or two after you see them drop theres.

b. Standard 14/14, when i see this I ALWAYS 15 hatch especially on maps with double ramps (shakuras//antiga) because queens are extra powerful. 15 hatch does not lose to a 14/14 if you do it right, which is make queens and lots of lings and maybe a spine. You will be ahead in larva and can easily overwhelm them with mass lings. 

b. 15 hatch. If you see a 15 hatch, 15 hatch yourself, its surperior to 14/14.

4. Queens are your friend in early game. Two queens can block a ramp of almost infinite zerglings and banelings. 3 Queens can help do a protoss esque wall off that uses the hatch to walloff and an evo/spine. 

5. If you see a blind Roach opening with no banelings, go +1 zerglings they are better than roaches. If I see someone go one base roach no scout I consider it an instant win, drop an evo chamber, research +1 and take all off gas and mass lings to victory. Some maps roaches can be successful early (shakuras, anitga, maps with more ramps) They will have to make more roaches (not drones) to defend if they go blind w/o banelings, so you can make more drones, have +1 and mass lings if you see that he pushes

6. Overlord placement OL placement. It's crucial. Try to have one on the edge of his base to see units coming out, one in the middle of the best pathway to your base, and one somewhere at the ramp/natural of your base to see banelings morph, etc. Keep spreading them out until you get to lair tech. 

7. Mutas. Mutas are a solid choice in ZVZ but how you react to mutas depends. If they're going desperation mutas (i.e they lost a lot of units and want to come back in it by going mutas) then you can either drop a spire yourself if you think you can go a higher muta count, or if you dont think you could get a higher muta count but know your ahead, drop a hydra den, 1-2 spores per base, and make more queens

if the game is slightly even and his spire is more than 1/4 complete, you should probably get hydras and infestors and try to crawl to a third base. a roach hydra infestor army straight up will beat a mutaling/muta roach army. 

also, research overlord speed asap once you see it, and move overlords in so you don't risk getting them picked off.

Now to the fun part, some builds I've been messing with along with cheesy builds.

1. Cheesy build. Good on shakuras, meta, shattered and other maps where you see their overlord. 7 pool into 9 supply, wait for 200 minerals, make two extractors, and make 3 lings. Send 2 drones at 1/2 done of lings to the opponents base make two spine crawlers in their base and harass//defend the spines with your lings. Can get you some easy wins (and some bm!)

2. Speedling Muta, good for shakuras and antiga. 14/14 into whatever you want, but eventually get your expansion up, and mass spine crawlers at the small choke at your natural. Get good overlord placement because a lot of zergs will nydus your base if they see this. Quick ASAP to mutas and get a high muta count and take your third. With this you need to get upgraded 1/1 and eventually 2/2 lings/bane comp so you can beat a roach hydra comp at your front door. Spines with transfuse are REALLY good versus roaches so the turtle and tech route is really good especially if they don't tech as fast as you and try to break you.

3. 10 pool into fast expand. (good for ramp w/ choke maps) Go 10 pool, drone extractor trick to 11, overlord, then 3 lings to their base. Also make 1 queen and immediately after make another queen to protect your ramp. Either a or b will happen

a. 10 pool does significant damage, or you find a 15 hatch (yay, just kill the hatch or harass) there you go easy win

b. 10 pool isn't successful because they scouted or defended ez, then start making drones drones drones, and expand. The idea is that you tricked them into possibly all inning you within 2 or 3 minutes. But the joke is on them when you have 3 spines, natural finished, with 4 queens and more larva. If the other zerg expands then you might be even (still testing this im not sure how good it actually is)

1351625774.0,37,self.starcraft_strategy,12cr1b,Terran Mech: Supply Drop vs Mules,NoseKnowsAll,41,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/12cr1b/terran_mech_supply_drop_vs_mules/,"Yesterday in GSL, when Happy played mech, he used supply calldowns A LOT more than I've ever seen anyone do it before.  And it was certainly not just because he was going to be supply blocked.  Here's what I think about it:

When you go mech, usually you get a faster third orbital and try to max out on 3/4 bases while being very defensive versus an opponent's bio drop/map control play.  The reasoning for this fast third play: you get these bases FOR THE GAS COUNT.  You don't need the extra mins that they offer and usually most pros dump the extra mins into macro orbitals as they go into the late game.  Thus, Happy thought - well instead of muling and getting the macro orbitals for a huge late game mech play, why not just calldown supply instead.

The game he did this on can be found: [here](http://www.twitch.tv/gomtv/b/337423377) at around 1hr 30 minutes (Cloud Kingdom TvT).  Note how he doesn't start the supply calldowns until all 3 bases are established.

Pros:

* Calldown supply =&gt; Free 100 minerals in the very very long run.
* Calldown supply =&gt; SCVs not pulled off line to build depots.\
* Not using mules =&gt; You mine out your main 3 bases much slower, so you can stay on them for longer.
* Mules unneeded for a strong 3 base mech push on small maps and not super duper late game focused mech/sky terran play

Cons:

* Mules =&gt; 270 minerals in the very short run that you're missing out on.
* Less macro orbitals =&gt; Can't go for the super late game.
* If the calldowned depots die..... bad times are had by all.

**TL;DR** When going mech in TvT, you don't need the minerals for your army.  Thus, instead of muling so much, Happy used supply calldown in the mid game to save minerals.

What do you guys think about doing this?

**EDIT**: I think ClassicThunder and abstinenceee have worded both sides of the argument very well.  So I guess my real question is: do you think it's worth it to sack a couple of hellions to harass with in the mid game in order to gain an extra 1000 minerals in the long run?

While ZvT close positions are akin to locking a ballerina in a phone booth with a hungry bear, ZvP is a slightly different story. It's still heavily stacked in P's favor, but there are some very strong 2-base allins that zerg can pull off. This is a very unusual one that was inspired by a game I saw on Spanishiwa's stream a couple months ago. I've tried to refine the build and had tremendous success with it, mainly due to the sheer fucking unorthodox nature of it - nearly every game I win with it I have the P asking me ""...what the fuck do I do against that?"" Like all (zerg) builds it's not without holes, but it's very strong even if the opponent knows what's coming. The reason I called it the Rorschach is because the first time I successfully pulled it off I wound up typing ""I'm not stuck in close positions with you, YOU'RE STUCK IN HERE WITH ME!"" after he gg'd. Yeah, whatever. Second time I've written a guide, hopefully it doesn't suck. High masters zerg, I get matched against GM when I'm doing very well but usually wind up playing just the top of masters. Oh, and although this is written with Shattered Temple in mind, I imagine it could be used on that new lava map (I have that X'd) or any map where Blizzard decides to include stupidly short rush distances. Was originally planning on making this in response to the guy asking for zvp close pos help a week or so ago, but I've been busy and it got a bit too long for a reply. 

Anyways, the key components of this build are the Speedling, Queen, and Spine Crawler. Yeah, some of you might see where this is going but HOW you do it is very important. I consider this to be a fairly apm-intensive build, but the more solid your basic mechanics are the easier it will be for you - injects and creep spread are vital to this build's success. So here we go -

Start with 11p so you can fuck up FFE and get the hatch down in a reasonable amount of time as well as getting that first queen out quick. Once the hatch is down...

- Get 100 gas then pull 1 drone out (leaving 2 in), start speedling research
- Start making queens at both hatches. Do not stop. Ever. 
- Get enough zerglings and a spine or two (depending on his pressure) to secure your nat, then DRONE UP
- FIRST 25 ENERGY goes to a tumor connecting your main and nat and propagating towards the enemy base
- When you're at about ~100 gas after speedling, start an evo and start carapace when you hit 150. Pull another drone off gas (leaving 1)
- Eventually when you hit 100 gas again, pull the final drone off gas

So let's recap. You're expanding, securing your natural with speedlings/spine while starting an early creep spread and beelining for +1 carapace after speedling and pulling a few drones off gas. Simple enough. Now here's the core of the build - your goal is a slow but steady spine/queen/creep push with a ton of +1/+1 speedlings supporting it. But first, we gotta know what the P is doing. Meanwhile, DRONE THE FUCK UP AND DO NOT STOP MAKING QUEENS + DO NOT STOP SPREADING CREEP. And if I actually have to tell you to inject, you should stop reading this guide and go practice more. 

- If he's being dumb and 4gating just throw up some spines make lings and win
- If he's doing some kind of gate pressure expand, get a couple spines/lings but still drone up really hard, you shouldn't need to deviate much to deal with this
- Any kind of FFE should have been solidly fucked up by your 11p, if he's managed to keep the forge up on the low ground and is still expoing then just delay his nex as much as possible with your initial lings and skip the early spines for faster drones and doubleplusfocus your creepspread
- Get a spore in the middle of each mineral line at around 6:15 or so if he's not expanding and station some lings in each mineral line as well just in case of dt. Also get a spore at your front spines, you are NOT going lair so better too many spores than too few
- Any kind of 1 base air gets stomped by your mass queens, period

You want to get to 3 lines of drones on minerals on each base (24 per) - this is ""full saturation"" on minerals. Right before you get there (or earlier if you can spare the minerals without cutting queens/drones and without dying) drop an auxiliary hatch in your main. I usually prefer to drop it at the top of my ramp. When it's down, keep making queens out of it as well and keep spreading creep (use some extra queen energy on extra tumors for SUPER ULTRA HYPER FAST creepsread - don't be afraid to drop a ton). Get thee creep to thy enemy base posthaste. 

You should be adding spines periodically just to stay safe and keeping only a minimal number of lings initially while you drone up and get those queens and drones. When you near your saturation goal, add more spines until you have 5-6 (don't forget to replace these drones, always replace drones - To make this easier once I hit the saturation goal I set all 3 hatch rallies to the natural then just use natural drones to make spines). Once these spines are complete, this is your signal to begin the push - your creepspread should be getting notable and your goal is to get your spines and a ton of queens to the enemy base. You eventually want to have around 10 spines once the push hits the enemy base but you obviously don't want to get all 10 right away when you start. You'll have at least a dozen queens or more. Switch over to pure and constant speedling production (and remember to get your +1/+1, carapace first).

The whole idea is you advance this wall of spines towards his base with the queens backing them up and a creep spread that makes the Indonesian Tsunami look like a fucking glacier. If he tries to break through, then that's what the mass speedlings are for - surround and crush while transfusing like a madman. Once you get the spines up near his choke he's essentially contained. If he tries to go around your wall, then flank him and transfuse well - I also build my additional (#5-10) spines at my natural and then walk them up as I'm doing this push, so in case he does try a runaround into the natural he's still gotta deal with spines plus the upgraded speedlings plus he's on creep the entire time. And if he doesn't flat out win when he does that (or do crippling damage) he's just going to die very quickly (or be contained for an eternity while you disco your way to victory). Make sure to still scatter your overlords in case of warp prism shenanigans - also keep two near the push so you can see up onto high ground. Two is twice as good as one.

The rest is, well, as ""straightforward"" as can be for a build like this. Push up with your spines, keep a spore near them if there's a DT possibility, transfuse like crazy, don't stop making queens and lings. Replace spines if they die but try not to lose them, since you'll have to replace the drones as well. As far as injecting goes, I find it's best to time everything so all 3 hatches queens are completing at the same time, they all inject, then run off to join the front line while the next round of queens is being made. The timing works out that the next queen pops out right as the inject completes, but you should fucking know that already!

The lings act as a massive buffer. You want to keep massing them behind the wall of spines and only use them when he sends his units in, otherwise you keep leapfrogging your spines the same way (good) Terrans leapfrog tanks, except much faster. You've got to keep up the leapfrogging, make sure you transfuse everything that's getting attacked (the front will turn into a near-continuous battle if the P is good), keep queueing those queens, keep injecting, and keep up the creep spread, and keep making lings. This is why it's somewhat apm-intensive, if you glance away at the wrong time and 3 queens die because they weren't transfused it can really hurt you. Your buildings will be nigh-invulnerable as long as your queens are alive, have energy, and you're paying attention. Your lings are expendable, your queens are not. Eventually you get to his natural and push into it, etc. How you fight his army obviously depends on what he has. So let's hop over to the Protoss point of view and look at what he can do off of his 2 bases.

1342854084.0,35,self.starcraft_strategy,wwz3y,I win 90% of TvZ in Plat - would be curious if this build works in higher leagues - or just helps others,vic42482,38,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wwz3y/i_win_90_of_tvz_in_plat_would_be_curious_if_this/,"So I'm only Plat but I feel like since latest patch I've been winning 90% of TvZ pretty easily. It used to be my worst match up, now became my best. Since so many people complain about TvZ lately, maybe this build will help someone.

The basis of the build is blue-flame hellions. LOTS OF THEM. But that's not the only thing why it works. Many Terrans stopped going reactor hellions since the patch as they say it's impossible to deal with queens - but that is exactly why I started winning. I just produce MORE hellions. Zergs are getting cocky thinking they can hold hellions with queens and spinecrawlers now, but when they are overwhelmed with sheer amount of blue flame hellions good things started to happen for me.

Another main point to the build is to make Zerg produce non-drones AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE and not let them get to the comfortable late game composition.

Finally, this build is pretty fluid and flexible. It has two main phases. How long each phase is depends on Zerg's reaction.

* **Phase 1** - mass blue flame hellions

* **Phase 2** - Two-base marine tank push

Here are the details of the build:

**Phase 1**

1. Fake bunker rush with two marines - this is just to get them to produce non-drones. Even if you lose the two marines, bunker and scv it's completely worth it every time. But try to cancel the bunker and return the marines if possible - or cause as much damage as possible. If bunker completes - great. Try to salvage it before it gets destroyed. This is not essential part of the build and may not work in upper leagues, but works for me in plat. Gas on 13 as usual.

2. After 2 marines - factory, reactor on barracks, switch and start reactor hellions

3. Tech Lab on barracks right away (for second factory coming up).

4. CC

5. Build second factory as soon as you can afford it while producing reactor hellions - you can start building on top of tech lab left by barracks. Once complete Blue Flame research right away. Constantly pump 3 hellions at a time until Phase 2

6. I build another tech lab on barracks at this time and leave it empty - because you need it for quick tank switch later

7. Reactor on barracks - for marines. Since first two marines, no marines produced until this reactor is complete.

8. Wall off your natural with supply depots and continue scv production.

All of this on one gas.

**What to do with blue flame hellions**

1. Try to run by as soon as you get 4 hellions to scout and see the front. Some zergs don't even make spine crawlers thinking queens can hold everything now.

2. Keep initial small number of hellions by entrance to the natural. Rally the rest hellions slightly behind the first batch. Try to keep the numbers hidden. If queens move out they should see small number at first.

3. As soon as you get to 8-10 hellions, try to do a run by and go for drones, but attack zerglings and queens if you cant get past them. This would be best case scenario. If they don't wall off or have just one spine crawler. 8-10 blue flame hellions can start killing queens and zerglings pretty fast. And there are more on the way rallied to entrance of the natural. You have to kite the zerglings obviously. If you feel like you're losing or numbers don't look right, pull back and reinforce with more hellions and try again.

4. If zerg keeps producing lings and queens or even banelings you can overwhelm them pretty fast with constant flow of blue-flame hellions if you kite properly. Sometimes you can win right here. If they think they can beat the hellions with mass queens (which is the main mistake I seen since the patch) - they're wrong as long as you keep pumping 3 hellions at a time non-stop and attack in large numbers.

5. If they're walled off and/or have spinecrawlers - don't try to force it. Sit outside their natural and prevent creep and 3rd base. As long as you're macroing at home you're winning 2 base vs 2 base. If they try to move out with queens, zerglings or banelings, blue flame hellions should handle all of it, if you kite properly and don't let them get surrounded. At certain point you can even kill spine crawlers with big enough number of BFhellions.

Here are the scenarios from Phase 1 - from best case to worst case:

1. You win by overwhelming them

2. You cripple their economy by killing drones

3. You force them to make non-drones, prevent creep and prevent 3rd base, making their economy weak. You kill zerglings/bailings and hopefully queens.

**When to transition to Phase 2**

The only way zerg can break out of Phase 1 is Roaches or Mutas. As soon as you smell roaches or mutas you need to switch to phase 2. This can be very early - even before BlueFlame is finished (which is fine - because that means they're on weak economy having to make roaches so early), OR very late, which is great, cause they've been on 2 base the whole time - as long as you macro at home you should be ahead.

Try to scan their main to see when switch to Roaches or Mutas is happening - or if you're lucky enough to run into main with hellions and spot it great. You also need to have some timing sense from experience about when to scan. 

If you don't scout Roach Warren early enough - not the end of the world. Once you see roaches popping out try to keep them in their base as long as possible - by retreating to watch towers and then running around roaches and threatening to attack their bases as soon as you see roaches move out. You don't want roaches to attack your base until you get seige mode in Phase 2.

**Phase 2**

1 -While constantly pumping 3 hellions at a time on 2 base, build the following as soon as you can afford them:

* 3 More barracks (4 total now)

* 2 Engineering bays

* 3 gases (remember you're on 1 gas the whole time)

* Two tech labs on 2 of the 3 barracks you just built.

* Start building marines. I rally them to main base in case mutas unexpectedly appear.

. As soon as you smell Mutas or Roaches

* Stop hellion production

* Switch your factory to the empty Tech Lab you built back in Phase 1. This really comes in handy to start mass Tanks ASAP without waiting to build Tech Lab. Also can save your ass if roaches hit unexpectedly. Good thing about mass hellions - it switches to mass tanks pretty fast.

* Siege mode

* Place 4th barracks on the reactor freed up by Factory. Now you have 2 racks with tech labs, and 2 with reactors.

* From this point on mass marines and tanks from 4 barracks and two factories.

* Stim, Combat Shield, Plus 1 attack, Plus 1 Armor from 2 tech labs and 2 e-bays.

* No starport - until you move out, unless you can afford it, which means your macro probably slipped or it's getting late in the game.

* If there are mutas, build missile turrets so that when you move out you'r protected.

2 - Once all upgrades finish and you have 6-8 tanks, move out with everything. If you kept them on 2 base for Phase 1, their economy is crippled and this timing attack should crush them. As long as you siege up in time and micro correctly you should have enough to kill or cripple them. At this time they should just finish saturating their 3rd that they couldn't get for so long.

3 - As you move out build starport and 3rd CC. By this time you can usually afford it. So that even if this timing attack doesn't kill them, you further pressure them into producing non-drones while taking your 3rd and are in good shape for the late game. 

4 - Send reinforcments in bunches so they don't get killed off one by one. 

5 - I also don't put any add-on on starport until later in favor of producing medivacs as soon as possible. But first wave of attack without medivacs is usually sufficient as long as you stim just once or twice.

**That's it!**

Most of the times when I lose this match up is because I failed to switch from Phase 1 to Phase 2 effectively by either:

* Missing scouting and reacting too late to Roaches. As soon as siege mode is done you should be safe from roaches. And as long as you build marines in your base, you should be safe from Mutas.

* Messing up my macro while microing BFhellions and end up with bank of minerals - I don't have Master level multitasking :)

* I just mess up the build - again, I'm not that skilled :)

You may ask what I'm still doing in Plat if I win 90% of TvZ, well… I lose about 90% TvP. I can't figure out this match up at all. As long as Protoss goes 1 gate expand, I tried keeping up with their production - fail. I try build up on 2 base and do timing attack as soon as they take 3rd - fail. I try fast 3rd - fail. I feel like Protoss can just outproduce you and if you go max vs max they always win. So if anyone has good TvP strategies let me know.

Piece!

EDIT: Just grabbed 2 most recent replays of this. Sorry I didn't save any good ones when I actually executed it better. So I mess up ALOT in both games, yet still win. So I always try to do the build above, but like I said I'm not that good :) so I keep messing things up. If I could execute it perfectly like I have it in my head, would be much easier.

Watch your replays. It doesn't matter how you watch them, just watch them. Playing a game is good, and if you're pretty good at scouting then you'll probably think ""Why should I bother watching when I know how I lost or won"" but that's not the case. There are a billion things you can get out of the replays, and I promise you the more you watch your replays the faster you will improve.

If you want to get better at macro, watch yourself. Just watch your production and your minerals. YOu'll be surprised by how much you cap at sometimes.

If you want to get better at timings, watch the whole unit count and army sizes. You'll notice glaring holes in your own and your opponent's army compositions and sizes at certain points in the game. After 3 or more replays from the same race you'll start seeing ""oh hey, A lot of Zerg really skims on zerglings around 8 minutes.""

If you want to get better at battle movements just watch the armies. Try and figure out how you lost engagements and such.

One of the most helpful things I've noticed, and one of the few ways I can watch my replays is to watch from the opponents view, especially when they won. There is always just so much to learn.

Now that 10 Coaching Sessions have been had, I think its time I thank everyone who has helped them happen. 

If you've been to #1 and then #10, you know just how far this little event has come. I think it is better than ever.

But, I couldn't have done it alone. 

It was a slow start. I was worried about not having enough coaches, then not enough people showing up to get the coaching. At first, I thought I would have to go out of my way to find coaches willing to provide their services for free. I didn't. Coaches ended up coming out of the woodwork, and they've done a good job.

Unlike any of the ""Show some love"" posts on /r/starcraft, I'm posting to thank people who have received nothing in return. There is no salary. No ad revenue from streams or a website. Those who have helped have put in hours and hours for nothing in return.

And, although there is no way I will remember everyone, I'll try to:

* Pochi
* L0X
* Zodiac
* eXecution
* NiSoh
* DarkDolphins
* BlackDraft
* Wrath
* Stooben
* Sinthrill
* Pughy
* Giantorange
* Seaweed

Once again, thanks to all who've helped. And, if I've forgotten you, I'm terribly sorry. Let me know and I'll put you up there. You deserve some recognition.

It's not just the coaches though :D

Thanks to EVERYONE who has come to the sessions. We've grown bigger and better because of everyone who shows up.

Aside from that I will also be doing coaching every week. The coaching is free and I will take anyone of any race. As of right now I pick someone in advance I have not coached before and go for there. The coaching lasts for 2 hours and will be on Wednesday at 6pm Pacific.  
  
I hope to see you guys there and hope you enjoy it!

As before, I was wondering if I could get some feedback from this awesome community on the same things. Feel free to comment either right here or on the website itself, for I'll check both of them.

* How do you like the layout on the page (ignore the web design itself - focus on the ordering/layout of the contents of a build order)?
* Is there any information that you think is wrong?
* When you look for a new build, are you looking for more information than is currently provided?
* How do you like the ""tutorial"" feature (they're just a collection of games vs a very easy AI where I perform the build perfectly with minimal micro)?
* What other builds am I missing to cover all of TvZ? (I didn't include TLO's classic 6rax on one base and other cheeses like cloaked banshee because you don't really see them anymore)
* Any other random comments/concerns/questions are totally awesome to hear too!

""Unscheduled"" events will probably continue into the night.

These events have been quite the success, let's continue that!

---

This will be how the overall event will be run:

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

• Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""

• Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes). A couple events ago, there were a large number of Bronze/Silver/Gold so we had to make a BS and a G.

---

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available at www.teamspeak.com . Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is **server.valdegames.com**

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Lastly, streams will be available. 

I will be running the Plat/Diamond peepmode and organizing everything. My stream can be found at: www.twitch.tv/iechozz

NoseKnowsAll will be running the Bronze-Gold peepmodes. His stream can be found at: www.twitch.tv/noseknowsall

I'm looking here first because this place is a little more formal than [/r/starcraft](/r/starcraft). The entire concept of a BO subreddit is kind of flawed due to the way reddit works. The posted builds could be downvoted, or just buried under piles of other posts never to be seen again. But there are ways around this. First of all, the moderators would need to be very active. Anyone would be able to post builds or comments, but only 'approved' builds would get a sticky (added to the menus) on the front page. I'm not sure if there would be a formal way to 'approve' builds, but the whole idea is to filter out builds like 'joe shmo's 5 pool', or 'broodlord FE'.  

[I've taken a few minutes to throw together the basic idea of the subreddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/StarcraftBuilds) Please take a look. I posted a few audiobuilds to demonstrate how the [/r/music](/r/music) style lists will index the 'approved' builds (be sure to check 'use subreddit style') . ~~Also, i don't think voting would be particularly useful, as the front page of this subreddit would be a rather poor place to look for its content~~. The Front page could be used along with the comments to discuss the builds, or how to respond to respond to different situations. The idea is that someone would be able to find a build in the menu's and people can post feedback and discuss the build orders. Also, with proper moderation the builds can be removed when they become outdated, unlike TL's wiki. 

So do you think this would work?

[ggtracker](http://ggtracker.com) now has army strength graphs and second-by-second army composition. it's not perfect, but i hope you find it's good enough to give you a feel for a game.

for example, here's a great game from the recent Jinro replay pack: http://ggtracker.com/matches/159538

the ""active army strength"" graph shows the strength of the ""active army"" of each player. [this post](http://ggtracker.tumblr.com/active_army) goes into more detail, but basically your ""active army"" are the units that you've ever selected. unfortunately that's all the replay file has.

anyway, as you can tell from the active army graph, something pretty wild happens in this game around 29:29 

to see the army composition at any point in the game, just hover your mouse over the active army graph. you can also click-and-drag to zoom, or click to ""freeze"" the army selection at that point in time.

one use: asking for advice on a game. some people may not have time to watch a whole replay, but just by looking at the active army graph, they (and you!) might notice important things about the game, like what units you have and how well they counter the enemy's.

it's new software, might have bugs, if you think you see a problem, please read this and then i'd be grateful if you drop me a line.

to use it, simply click the blue upload button on ggtracker and pick one or more replay files. hope you like it... let me know what you think! --dj",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_reo2g,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/reo2g/new_tool_for_you_replay_army_graph_and_army/,

I've also learned a lot for improving next time.

* Have survey include League/Race information so it is easier/quicker to set up the Peepmodes once the event begins
* Teamspeak! Teamspeak! Teamspeak! It really should be a requirement (unless people only watch the stream).
* Divide Peepmodes by league!!!
* Channel organization. Coach/Player channels can have observers listening in to what coaches tell players, etc.

There are some other things but they all tie in together.

Hello again guys. I thought I would follow-up with some more information and give you the results of the survey.

If you are a Masters player willing to coach OR if you can help in some way/shape/form, PM me here on Reddit and we will talk about your contact information. If we get this planned out enough, with enough help, we will get this thing going.

Whether or not we get this specific idea going, I have decided to start up an on-going coaching channel for this subreddit. This way, you can interact instantaneously with those familiar faces you see on this subreddit giving you help all the time.  *looks at Nose/Nick/Nadril/others* ;). You can also find practice partners and just talk about strategy with others.

All you have to do is join the channel ""StarCraft Strategy"" -- Please idle in it even if you aren't going to talk in it. 

This is a NA chat channel, although if those EU players among us would like to start up their own chat channel, that would be great also.

Survey results (~94 submissions):

**1) What do you think about the idea of having a coaching session?**

 57.4% for Great idea

 42.6% for Good, as long as well planned out

**2) What method do you think is best for running the coaching session?**

 74.4% for Mass Peepmode game with coaches helping two players at a time
 
 25.6% for Having two Masters players play while two more Masters players commentate on decisions, etc.

 *Other responses were read and considered*

**3) What is your region?**

1320219113.0,27,self.starcraft_strategy,lxh49,EGHuk's fast-3rd macro PvZ build,kengou,33,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/lxh49/eghuks_fast3rd_macro_pvz_build/,"[high diamond/low masters]

I've been having a ton of success with this build since I saw and studied it a lot at MLG Orlando.  It keeps Protoss even with the Zerg economy, and functions much the same way the old 3-gate expand build used to go - we're just starting with an additional base to work with.  I feel like this build is incredibly flexible and probably the best safe macro build you can opt for right now.  It's also fairly easy to execute.

The gist of the build is this:
Forge FE.
I make 1 zealot and send it straight to Zerg's main to scout.
make nothing but sentries, get +1 weapons and warp gate.
chronoboost probes a LOT.  almost exclusively, in fact.
make a total of 6 gates, as if you were doing an all-in.

If Zerg scouts this, he'll cut drones and start producing units and spines in anticipation of the all-in.  I've had Zergs overreact so badly they cancel the spire or whatever tech they have building, cut drones at 50 for several minutes, and make 6 spines.  This is an added bonus but not at all necessary for success!  If Zerg doesn't scout this or your zealot sees some greedy tech like mutas, you can actually choose to all-in here.

As soon as warp gate finishes, warp in sentries (up to 8-ish then stop) and zealots.  Right around the 8:30 or 9 minute mark, when warp gate finishes, make the 3rd base.  I like to push out at this timing to make Zerg think I'm doing the 6-gate all-in - make sure to include a probe so he'll buy it!

We have to rely on forcefields, cannons, and building placement to survive roach-ling aggression right now.  Just like the 3-gate expand - except instead of trying to secure the natural expansion, we're securing our 3rd.  Zerg has a 3-base economy to pressure, but we have a 2-base economy and 6 gates.  To pressure the expo Zerg has to forgo drones, which is great for us, as long as we survive.

As soon as 3rd base is secure, make robo facility and twilight council simultaneously.  This gives a ton of flexibility.  Make an observer as soon as the facility finishes.

At this timing is when Zerg's tech will reveal itself.  See a flock of mutas? Start blink and make a templar archives.  See roach pressure? Start that robo bay!  If Zerg hasn't made his presence known at this point, and you haven't pressured to check his army comp, just start the robo bay AND blink.  No big deal.  Get up to +3 weapons before beginning any armor upgrades.  If he goes mutas, delay colossus production in favor of blink stalkers and possibly psi storm.  The mutas won't deny our 3rd base because it's already up and running.  Just prevent any major damage.

At this point we kind of just sit until we're maxed.  Take a 4th AND a 5th base at this timing while you get aggressive (the main and natural should be drying up soon).  The maxed protoss army is fearful as hell.  You should have 4-5 colossus and a ton of blink stalkers with 8 full energy sentries; OR you should have a bunch of templar with storm, blink stalkers, and possibly some immortals.  Whatever you have to do based on what Zerg is making.  This is also when you can add a dark shrine and whatever other tech you want to.  Assuming you got to this point relatively unmolested, you SHOULD win the game.

This build has some problems, of course.  It's weak (like most Protoss builds) to huge infestor-ling attacks when you're securing the 3rd and teching up.  It can be weaker to certain early all-ins because there's no stargate tech.  The build also only works on maps with an easy-to-defend 3rd base.  Building sim-city and cannons are an absolute requirement at the 3rd.

I've posted the TvZ section and TvT section of www.gosubuilds.com here and have received very helpful responses (see: the [TvZ reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wd5pu/i_have_officially_finished_the_tvz_section_of/) and [TvT reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/v73wi/hey_rstarcraft_strategy_i_was_wondering_if_you/)).

* Is there any information that you think is wrong?
* Can you find any typos?  (I surely hope not :/)
* When you look for a new build, are you looking for more information than is currently provided?
* What other builds am I missing to cover all of TvP?

* Any other random comments/concerns/questions are totally awesome to hear too!

Now that I've finished all of TvX, I'm looking into creating some guides for how general TvX styles work (like what sort of infrastructure you want to be on at certain base counts in certain matchups, and what you want to be scouting for during engages).  Also, I've been recording me going over the builds on [youtube here](http://www.youtube.com/user/gosubuilds) for the TvT section, and now that I've finished the TvX builds (until more pop up) on the website, I'm going to finish that for TvX also.

What do you think? Strategy ideas?**

Hey SC2 strategy enthusiasts,

You all may have heard/seen this already, but mapmaker Barrin has made some really interesting suggestions for a paradigm shift in Starcraft 2 maps (and thus gameplay) that revolve around the idea of having less mineral patches per base, with the example map called Devolution with 6 minerals and 1 high-yield geyser per-base (you can find it easily by searching).

His TL post is [here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=321242) (warning: very long, but with highlights), and there is an /r/starcraft thread on it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/qzp7d/breadth_of_gameplay_in_sc2_a_mapmakers/).

He has a lot of good ideas that raise interesting points about the way the meta-game has developed so far, and how 6m/1hyg maps might expand variety in gameplay by fusing the better aspects of SC2 with the better aspects of Brood War.

My questions for discussion are these:

Have any of you read/skimmed the article played this map? What do you think?

What kind of ideas do you have about strategy and meta-game for maps like these?

1350322713.0,28,self.starcraft_strategy,11ir6b,Holding All Ins: General Concepts,IsomerSC,33,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/11ir6b/holding_all_ins_general_concepts/,"Hello Everyone,  
  
I saw a post about how to hold all-ins in ZvP and I thought I would do a short write-up about how to hold all-ins in general.  
  
Task 1: What is an all-in? While difficult to define, I would say an all-in is a strategy after which no transition is intended and/or a build that MUST do damage to be viable. I distinguish from ""pressure"" builds in that pressures need to do some minimal damage, whereas all-ins pretty much need to cripple and/or kill to be viable. 
  
Task 2: Identifying an All In Before it Comes  
This is really crucial. If you don't scout an all-in before it comes, your chances of holding it are MUCH worse. You need to be active on the map and scouting your opponent as often as you can if you find yourself dying to allins a lot.  
The other piece of identifying an all-in, besides scouting, is interpreting what your opponent is doing.   This is less mechanical than scouting and requires a lot more game-sense/knowledge. You really develop this sense by playing a lot of games and watching professional games to see X means Y and Z means A, etc.  
  
Task 3: Reaction  
Once you identify it is coming, there is almost always an optimal reaction to any allin. If you don't know it, you have to pick a plan and try it. If you die, analyze if that choice was your downfall or if the execution of the choice was your downfall. Here are some examples of reactions:  
  
ZvP: I think a 2+ blink stalker allin is coming, so I make roach ling only once I hit 60 drones.  
ZvZ: I think a 14g14p ling bane allin is coming against my 15 hatch, so I make defensive banelings, delay speed, make a spine, and bring both queens to my nat.  
PvZ: I see a 7 roach rush coming, so I make extra cannons.  
  
You see there are ""optimal"" reactions to different allins, but you first need to scout them and identify them before you can ever think of a reaction. After you have done all your preparations, it's really all about micro/decision making because the game is no longer about the future, but about the present.   
  
General Concepts  
1. When in doubt, play safely. If you play really greedily, you are going to die to a lot more all-ins, which feels like shit and which reduces the efficacy of your practice time. Just play safely so you can get to all phases of the game.  
2. If you see an allin coming, DO NOT PLAY GREEDILY. For instance, when people drone/10pool me and I go 15p15h (yes, that has happened 3 times in masters), I don't greedily make only 1 spine. I cancel the hatch and make 3. There is NO REASON to do anything except make units and defenses when you see an allin coming.  
3. When in doubt, sacrifice an expansion. There is no reason to lose your entire army to an allin to save a base. If it's going to die and you can't do anything, retreat.",,False,,t5_2smn2,1350337773.0,,race-z,True,t3_11ir6b,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/11ir6b/holding_all_ins_general_concepts/,

I coached Plat and Diamond Zergs for about 3 hours yesterday and I noticed a lot of themes that all the players could improve on:  
  
1. Map Awareness: You need to constantly be taking the Xel Nagas from your opponents, put marines/lings/probes at pivotal expansions, scout your opponent frequently, check the minimap frequently. A lot of the Zergs I had lost games because they weren't scouting their opponents' expansions, they were getting torn up by drop harass, they didn't see a push coming, etc.  
  
2. Macro: Many players were having significant problems spending their money, often banking 500-1000 in the early game and 1000-2000 in the midgame. If you are having problems with this, go into a match against a very easy computer and just macro to 200/200 with your favorite build without floating money. If you do this 3-4 times a day, you will spend money a lot better and win a lot more games.  
  
3. Tech: Many people were having problems with teching fast enough. You have to get your upgrades PROMPTLY and get your tech PROMPTLY. Every second you are not getting that 2-2 is time wasted. You really need to focus on that intently so your timings are faster, which will help you win more games.  
  
4. Basics: Still lots of problems here: supply blocks, worker saturation, gas saturation, taking bases in a timely manner, etc.

5. Advanced Concepts: These are more ""advanced"" in my opinion, but I still will note them.

I know a lot of you are starting to go over to the allthingszerg/protoss/terran subreddits for help. Being a part of those subreddits myself, I know they are good for getting some help and circlejerking about your race can always be fun after some tough losses. 

HOWEVER (in all caps because it is a big however), getting advice from the race you need help against can be exactly what you need.

The more perspectives, the better. Perhaps for your PvZ woes, a Zerg just found a build that stomps his X when you do Y. etc etc etc.

I've seen many posts, on every subreddit, from people who say ""pls don't post if you aren't X ranked Y."" Why? You are asking people to withhold potentially valuable information. 

For myself personally, when I posted here for TvZ help shortly after the queen buff, the Zerg's comments actually ended up being the most helpful.

1329838638.0,26,self.starcraft_strategy,pzef1,A Terran on High Templar. Why they aren't imbalanced in TvP and how you stop Protoss late game. Discuss. [X-Post from r/starcraft],julythekon,31,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/pzef1/a_terran_on_high_templar_why_they_arent/,"So for the past few weeks, the terran community on [1] /r/starcraft has been complaining about late game TvP. The main reason seems to be High Templar. The reasons are stated in this thread: [2] http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/4079839549?page=1. Summary the points made there: Cost 50/150 vs. ghost cost of 200/100. Splash damage capabilities and feedback. Can morph into archons. Capable of killing units massive amounts of units. Paired with colossus, almost impossible to stop late game.


Now while all these are true, they have to be taken in context.


The main purpose of storm is area control, specifically denying the opposing army an advantageous position. Its primary purpose is not area damage. When used for area damage alone, storms are easily dodged. Now to the details.


1) Cost - While the net cost difference between High Templar and Ghosts are a total of 100 resources, HT's cost 150 gas. Protoss units, with the exception of probes and zealots, are very gas intensive. Gas is a critical resource for any Protoss player. 150 gas is a large investment for any player, and even more so for a Protoss player.


2)Storm - Ever since the KA nerf, templars haven't been able to storm right after a warp in. You may say, oh gee, they wait a little then its no problem, they can storm. Take into account two things: timings and future battle prospects.


2a) Timings - In TvP games at the professional level, the TvP win/loss ratio is very balanced. One of the main reasons is because pro level Terrans have mapped out timing attacks that punish HT play. With good scouting and a refined build order, a well executed MMM timing off two base right before storm kicks in works very well. If you let the protoss sit back and enjoy his HT's without pressure, don't expect to win. Terran is based on aggression and harassment. You can also delay the timing of the protoss' HT by harassing with drops. It is difficult to split the Protoss army effectively to deal with drops and be safe at the front at the same time. Use this advantage. Again, Terran needs to be aggressive in the early to mid game. It is an advantage our race has over the other two.


2b) Future prospects - Before the KA nerf, HT's had enough energy to use storm more than once in a battle. You would rarely see HT's morph into archons in the middle of a battle as soon as storms were used as they had more energy to storm or were very close to being able to do so. Now, HT's storm and are rendered useless if it misses. Although late game engagements can mean stored up storms, it is still not always possible due to EMP's. Force engagements and bait out storms earlier on in the mid-game so energy stays low for the HT. Again, be aggressive. Do NOT let the Protoss sit back. If you do, its your fault and not an imbalance.


3) Positioning - A lot of the late game in this MU comes down to positioning. It can turn the game in either person's favor even with a significant supply deficit. If you choose to engage on Protoss turf or Protoss terms, you will lose. Pick off observers and maintain map control. Terran army is more mobile than the Protoss deathball. Drop to get the Protoss out of position and move in with your main army.


4) Unit Composition - Make sure you have a balanced Unit composition. Making a ton of ghosts and no vikings to counter colossus is not good and vice versa. If you lose, its your fault. Make sure you have enough medivacs to heal your stimmed MMG force.


5) Unit Control - Probably the most important point and where most Terrans go wrong in this MU. First, practice putting ghosts and your MM force on two hotkeys and make sure you can switch back and forth smoothly. Make sure your vikings are attacking the colossus and get off potshots whenever you can. Picking off observers is a big part of the battle also, as the Protoss has no other way of scouting. Make a raven, scan or build turrets, they are all worth their weight in Gold minerals. Stim at the last minute (right before your engage) and do not overstim. Make sure you engage with a concave. It is much better to back off with a few losses than engage is a bad position and lose the game. Do not be afraid to run back to bunkers, turrets and reinforcements.


5a) Snipe outranges storm and feedback. Make sure you scan the Protoss army consistently and pick off any stray HT. Keep your ghosts near the front of your army and snipe HT right as the battle starts. It gets harder for HT's to feedback as the battle starts so EMP will also work then. Trading a EMP on a bunch of HT is worth taking a storm to just one or two ghosts.


5b) MICRO your MM force back away from the zealots and colossus. Let your vikings do damage to the colossus and focus on keeping away from chargelots. It makes a world of difference.
What the late game comes down to is control and composition. If you say it is much more work on the Terran's part, then you are wrong. Protoss have to keep Colossus away from vikings, zealots at the front while constantly watching for ghosts to snipe them. If an obs gets picked off, they have to halt colossus production to make more and are temporarily blind. It is not easy, but the Terran can win engagements.

I, like I'm sure some of you, was watching the Proleague series between STX_SOUL and SKT1.  In game 6, Trap executed a beautiful PvP all-in against Bisu to set up Innovation for the win in the ace match.

This all-in opened with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to rush out the fastest warpgate timing possible (WARPGATE FINISHES AT 5:15 O_o).  Hell, the SECOND warp-in happens before 6 minutes.  

So this build got me thinking... 4gate is dead in HotS because the MSC always has enough energy to stay safe for a whole 60 seconds - in which time you can get the units, tech, or economy you need to hold it off.  But this build hits LONG before the MSC has enough energy at all!  **It hits your opponent with 5 Stalkers and a Zealot at 5:30.**

1347378923.0,26,self.starcraft_strategy,zporf,How to Improve your Macro Every Day,IsomerSC,30,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/zporf/how_to_improve_your_macro_every_day/,"Hey Everyone,  
  
Someone posted a question about if there exists some sort of training regiment for Protosses to improve their macro daily. This regiment would basically incrementally increase the macro challenge that you are putting onto yourself and thus ensures you increase yo' skillz over time.  
  
I would not recommend practicing this way for a number of reasons. First of all, you do not want to put limits onto your growth because this is not athletics, you are not limited by muscle growth or recovery time. You want to improve as quickly as possible, so for this reason I would give yourself more general goals such as ""Max out as quickly as possible with only roaches, lings, and drones"" and then see if you can do it in 12, 11:30, or even 11 minutes! For terran, just do marine marauder, or marine tank; for Protoss, just gateway units or stalker/colossus, or whatever. It really doesn't matter what composition you choose for these exercises. 
  
What does this generalized, goal-oriented method entail on a day-to-day basis? If you truly want to improve, you **must** play against AIs or in custom games to ensure there is no opponent pressuring you to make mistakes. Making mistakes is natural in SC, however we can not fix our common mistakes if we are worried about a timing attack.  
  
So, every single day, play 2 or 3 games, from the early game to maxed out, focusing SOLELY on macro. Don't worry about scouting, about micro, about unit composition: those things are simply distracting us from perfecting our macro. Just get really good at not getting supply blocked, making workers, spreading overlords/creep, injecting/muling/CB, all of those things. If you do this for 30 minutes a day for a couple of weeks, I am confident that the vast majority of sub-masters players would jump a league in skill level just because you get SO MUCH MORE STUFF. With more stuff, micro is even more effective, composition matters less, scouting matters less, etc.  
  
Furthermore, when your macro is really solid, you will suddenly find more time to do the scouting and the micro because you are suddenly macroing like a fiend.  
  
So get out there and 1A some very easy computers with maxed armies!

1362068546.0,23,self.starcraft_strategy,19ehb0,Cutting worker production at 2 per mineral patch?,Veshan,28,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/19ehb0/cutting_worker_production_at_2_per_mineral_patch/,"I've been running the numbers on the number of minerals brought in per worker, and the math to me really suggests that you shouldn't put more than 16 workers on minerals per base (other than when you are pre-building workers for an expansion that's being built).

At 16 workers on minerals, you bring in 672 minerals/minute. At 24 workers, you bring in 816. Thus, the 8 workers add 144 minerals/minute. At a cost of 50 minerals each, this means that adding workers from 16 to 24 gets you .36 minerals/minute for every 1 mineral invested.

Compare this cost-to-benefit ratio to putting those 8 workers on an expansion *including the cost of the expansion*. I'm going to treat the expansion as costing 300 minerals instead of 400 because it gives 10 supply and a pylon cost 100 and gives 8 supply, so you save yourself 100 minerals in supply costs when you expo. If you have 8 workers on minerals, you bring in 672/2 = 336 minerals/minute. At a total cost of 300 + 8*50 = 700 minerals, this means you get .48 mineral/minute for every 1 mineral invested.

So, when considering 8 workers added to a 16 worker base vs expanding to a new base, you get a better return on investment by expanding EVEN WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE COST OF THE EXPASNION. The disparity becomes even greater (in terms of minerals/minute for 1 mineral invested) when you consider the fact that you can drop another 8 workers on the expasion (if you consider all 16 workers, you get .61 minerals/minute per mineral invested)
So why would you build more than 16 probes per base? One reason might by that you can't expand due to your opponent. But considering how drastically better an investment it is to expand than super-saturate a base, it seems to me like you should cut production at 16 and invest your income into making that expansion possible (getting your army to the point of being able to defend it).

The other reason is if you have an expo building in progress and you want to pre-prepare some workers. This I would definitely advocate because you want to get your ROI going as quickly as possible.
As a final point of comparison, considering the workers in isolation from other costs, the 16th worker gives you .84 minerals/minute for each mineral invested whereas the 17th gives you .36 minerals/minute. The workers from 17-24 are less than half as effective as the first 16. Even if you can never expand for some reason, is it really worth the opportunity cost to build probes 17-24 when those minerals mean your army is that much smaller?

Edit: Mineral numbers come from http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Resources

Edit2: To be clear, I do think sometimes you will have no better options than filling out workers 17-24. I just think that in most situations you'd be better off focusing your income into getting yourself to a point where you can expand rather than trying to eke out the severely reduced income from adding workers 17-24.",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_19ehb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/19ehb0/cutting_worker_production_at_2_per_mineral_patch/,

**SO** we've all seen the new HoTS patch, with a bunch of protoss buffs to our air. I've always been interested in doing skytoss and feel like it might be a possibility now.

Lets start out by looking at the buffs to each unit:

---

**The Oracle:**

It now attacks ground units, and does 15+10 to light with a range of 4. 

I did some testing in the unit tester to see how the unit fared in fights. this is what I found:

&gt;So I was curious about how well the oracle could be used in a straight up fight. I'm in the unit tester now and testing with 0 micro from both sides. So far I've found:

&gt;**Oracle vs Hydra:** Oracle seems to always win a 1:1 fight (supply wise) with hydras. The oracles were 1 armor 1 shield, hydras were 1 weapon 1 armor. Even against 3 weapon 3 armor hydras (and 3 armor+3 shield oracles) the oracles win with 30 supply left out of a 48 supply start.

&gt;**Oracle vs Marine:** With 33 supply of oracles 0/0 vs 33 supply of marines 0/0 (combat shield+stim) the oracles won with 6 supply left. With 3 armor 3 shield oracles vs 3/3 marines (shield+stim) and both at 102 supply, the oracles win with 22 supply left. 

&gt;**Oracles vs Marine+Medvac:** With 81 supply each, 3 shield 3 armor oracles vs 3/3 marines (shield+stim) and 5 medvacs (no upgrade) the oracles won with 16 supply left. With the same values BUT the medvac upgrade, the marines barely win with 3 marines left.


&gt;So obviously the biggest thing is oracles cost a LOT more than any of these other units. Still for the most part they win by a massive landslide which means that air toss might be a possibility. It's cool to see that they are so strong against T1+T2 light units. 

&gt;The biggest thing is it seems like the oracle doesn't benefit from weapon upgrades so they aren't going to be as strong in a fully upgraded fight. They seem perfectly good though (A lot better than I thought) in a straight up fight though early.

Copy and post from something I posted on TL. As I mentioned the oracle pretty much beats any light unit in a 1:1 supply fight. A lot of times they win quite well. The downside is that the oracle is an expensive unit, but for a unit that is meant for harassment being able to hold your own against light T1/T2 units is a great thing.

---

**The Void Ray:**

It now no longer charges up, and no longer does passive +massive. Instead it has a new ability that ups dmg to armored by 6 for 20s. (1m CD).

So testing in the unit tester I've found this out:

&gt;**Void Ray vs Corruptor:** With 42 supply voids, and 42 supply corruptors (all 0/0/0) and without using the new void ability, the voids win with 18 supply left. (And no corruption use). With prismatic alignment AND corruption being used, the voids win with 30 supply left.

&gt; With 90 supply of void rays vs corruptors, both abilities used, and 3/3 vs 3/3 (no shields for toss) the void rays win with ~57 supply left completely crushing the corruptors. 

&gt;**Void Ray vs Hydralisk:** With equal cost for each side (69 supply void vs 122 supply hydra, 5750m/3450g vs 6100m/3050g) and max upgrades both sides (3/3/3 vs 3/3) the Hydralisk's win with ~20 supply left. 

&gt; With equal *supply*, however, the void rays crush through the hydras. 

&gt;**Void Ray vs Marine:** At 30 supply with equal supply the void ray wins with 12 supply left. (30 supply vs 30 supply). (Both sides max upgrades, stim+shield). At a high supply (78) but still equal the voids win by a landslide, at 48 supply left.

&gt; It's a bit too difficult to really test an ""equal cost"" because of the huge cost difference. Marines generally will win an equal cost fight though.

&gt;**Void Ray vs Marine/Medvac:** With the same upgrades + medvac upgrade, with 42 supply of void vs marine and an additional 6 medvacs the Marine/medvac wins with ~40 supply left.

&gt; Using equal supply of void ray vs medvac/marine the med/marine wins with 27 supply (still new upgrade).

---

So those are the two main tests so far that I've done. With that info, how do you guys feel the best way to open would be? It seems like an oracle opener with zealot support would be the best way. You could then transition into either void rays vs corruptors (talkin PvZ) or phoenix against mutalisk. Late game you can go into a tempest+carrier army. (I'm curious how carrier is being able to micro it now).

Sorry for the really long post but hopefully you guys found it interesting. If anyone else has tested stuff so far let us know.

I've noticed that master's is a very small bell curve, and where the curve flattens at the end is a very diverse and skilled group of players wielding strategies that demand impeccable scouting and game sense. A place where the difference in 100 points is an embarrassing loss or dominating win. I know zerg is having a great time right now at the pro level, but high masters looks like diamond compared to anyone you've ever watched a vod of. As you take the slow trek down the long tail of the bell curve, you realize that solid is another word for poor when it comes to game sense. I for one have a solid idea of what my opponent is up to, but as builds become crisper, what was once an aggressive pressure is now a means to take a third.

For all the success of zerg players at the tip top of sc2, I believe it has led many players to perfect ways in which to apply pressure to zerg. Against T its somewhere along the lines of 80% 2 base timing, and 15% 2 rax. Lately toss has been a base trade or a loss. Though I am knew to facing players over 1k points, it just feels like a fucking cheese zerg metagame right now. however, this often not the case. I see 4 stalkers coming to my third and i start preparing for a 7 gate that never comes, or 12 marines run into my nat at 7-8 min (I don't even know exactly, which is the point of this post), and a third is behind it. essentially what I'm getting at is, 200 points ago, these pressure builds put my opponent behind, where-as now they don't miss a beat with their macro.

So t and p are pressuring way more than i'm used to and I don't know how to respond besides gearing up pressure of my own. except for 2 rax, t is a guessing game of which units they choose to power before 10 minutes. against p its deciding if those 4 stalkers have a pylon behind them or a nexus. What I'm really looking for is a way to tell whats coming form the units I see at specific times, because sacking an ol isn't reliable or conclusive. if i see 4 stalkers at my third before wg, is that 100% an expo? if i see no hellions is that heavy bio pressure? I've passed the point where if something hasn't hit at a certain time, its not because my opponent is bad, its because he's doing something different. I just need pointers as to what it is without an ol flying over the entire base, because even the jet pack ol's can't get you enough info on most maps. or hell, if you have ol scouting tips let me know. 


ok guys, tear my builds apart.

zvt:
15/16. 28/28 double ol, double queen, double extractor. 6:30 roach warren. 7:00 double evo/ take third/ try and ol scout. gas goes to speed, 6 roaches, 1/1, lair, baneling nest. take third vs banshee hellion/ lose third to 2base mass bio, proceed to mid game vs macro terran(this doesn't exist except condemned, daybreak, maybe cloud). problem is, that i can proceed with lair tech or preempt banelings before 9:30. or its one of those rax/expo/rax things that sends a dozen rines at 7 minutes that kills queens and forces a shit ton of lings. just constantly over prepared or under prepared and suddenly it makes a fuck ton of difference. What is the minimal defense i can make against 2 base bio medevac? when can i expect my opponents third? if I lose my third is it gg? if i expect heavy bio, when is the right time to take my third? 7 minutes seems too early, buts there's that nice time when you have minerals and 2 gas saturated, that it seems perfect. just any pointers thrown my way would help.

zvp:
no idea what i'm doing. lol. basically try to survive all ins and pump muta when i see third go down cuz its usually with a robo. only success has been defending the pressures, and only counter attacking. I mean literally never having a roach attack an immortal and base trade 100% of the time. if there is a magic rw timing if you expect zealot/ stalker pressure off one gate please fill me in. is a fast third even viable on shakuras? can a roach based army ever beat any number of immortal sentry? why is ohana even in the map pool? Go look at sc2ranks.com, na is 50% toss at the top of masters. we know they're going sentry robo, they know we know, and the only way to win is to base trade or be stephano. biggest question here is identifying if chrono spent on pressure leads to gateway all in or expo. i love 11 pool to force gw and cannon before nexus, but still feel like any attack before hive will likely kill me. I've tried, roach infestor, but this still doesn't beat gateway immo in open ground, and you have to replenish constantly to stay alive. unless you can outright break protoss with roach max, I just don't see a way to win without heavy spire play and/base trading.

So please please please, any one who can give me tips along the lines of, no hellions before x time means rax play, and that coupled with nat gas timings for how all inish it is. Against toss I would like to know what you can infer based on pressure builds, like zealot count, coupled with nat gas timing and how the hell you know whether or not its an all in follow up or expo.

First 3 chronos are used consecutively on the nexus. The next two are used on warp gate. The next chrono is used on your 2nd sentry. From here you will have to decide if you need more probes (vs a 1 rax FE perhaps), faster units and observers (vs a 1-1-1 maybe), or faster units once WG is done (vs a 2 rax!).

You make a zealot, stalker and 2 sentries out of your first gateway before WG finishes. Once WG is done, you warp in 2 stalkers ASAP.

Scout with the probe used to make your gateway. This probes job is just to find out the spawn location of terran. Seeing gas timings is just a bonus. Try not to lose it!

Your third pylon must be overlooking your natural expansion! This is for your first warp in, just in case you are vs a 2 rax.

Leave your stalker outside his natural! This is super important! You need to see when he's moving out. You can bring this stalker home when your observer gets to his base.

With your robo, get 2 fast observers and scout. Based on this scouting information, you will decide the rest of your game plan.

**THE BUILD ORDER:**

9 Pylon

13 Gate

14 Gas

16 Pylon

18 Core

19 Zealot

22 Pylon

23 Stalker

27 Nexus

28 Sentry

30 Gateway

31 Assimilator

32 Pylon

32 Sentry

34 Robo

36 Stalker

38 Stalker

***

**THOUGHTS:**

This build is very ""tight"". It relies on hitting all your timings well, and being prompt with your chronoboost. If you are lower level, do not worry! This build is very much for you! It is still strong, and will allow you room to grow into the build. Easy to learn, but difficult to master.

In PvT, there are pretty much 3 standard openings. 1 Rax FE, 2 Rax pressure with concussive shell, and the ever so much fun 1-1-1. Let's talk about the most common opening first.

***

**RESPONSES:**

Since I'm focusing on the opening, I'm not going to talk too much about what to do vs these  strategies, but I will go over them briefly.

[**The 1 Rax FE:**](http://drop.sc/161581)

You are going to be safe, but slightly economically behind the terran. With your first observer you need to find out if terran went for the standard 3 rax + medivacs (play standard), [fast 3rd command center](http://drop.sc/161576) (expand to your third ASAP), or for a naked 4/5 rax with a ton of marines (build a lot of sentry stalker, and force field the marines away). 

[**The 2 Rax Pressure with Concussive Shell:**](http://drop.sc/122270)

You are going to have to pull probes. The timing for this works out in such a way that when  when the terran gets to your base is when you are transferring your probes from your main to your natural. Use the 2 stalkers that you just warped in (along with the 5 probes you transferred and the 1 zealot, 1 stalker, and 2 sentries you already had) to fend off this attack. Force field behind the terran army, and focus marauders with stalkers. Once you hold it off, you can play standard, or go all-in off 4 gates (only works on maps that don't have a ramp at the natural).

[**The Ever So Much Fun 1-1-1:**](http://drop.sc/161594)

Use your first observer to scout the 1-1-1. From here you want to get a total of 6 gates, and chrono immortals out of your robo. Be careful not to get supply blocked, you want to be making 2 pylons at a time(immortals are extremely supply heavy). Cut probes once you have 16 mining minerals at your natural. For the engagement, use GUARDIAN SHIELD, focus tanks with immortals, and focus banshees with your stalkers. A-move your zealot/sentry force (try to get the zealots coming in from behind, sandwiching them in between the tanks so they can't micro). If possible, try to lead with an immortal to take damage from the tanks. 

**Marine + SCV All-ins:**

These come in many flavors, the most common being a 2/3 rax coupled with pulling most of the SCVs. The key to defending these all-in is keeping calm. You need to build more gateways as soon as you can confirm this all-in. Next you need to decide if you can get a sentry in time to force field your ramp. If you can, great! You're well on your way to winning. If not make stalkers, and focus down the marines, pulling probes when necessary. Use the probes to surround the marines, and focus down marines with your stalkers. You probably scouted this with the stalker outside his ramp, so you need to kite the forces all the way back to your base. Every little bit of damage helps. Once again, the key to handling the marine/scv all-in is STAYING CALM, make units, and microing your stalkers!


**CC First:**

This build is pretty much like the 1 rax FE, except a bit more greedy. Since we're going gateway first, we CAN put on some pressure. I like to skip the chronoboosts on WG, and instead chrono out units from my gateway. You want to get to the same point (2 gates + robo + expand), but you also want some units to pressure early. I chrono out 2 zealots and stalker. I start my attack with the first zealot, and keep rallying units to his expansion. This can force terran into a bad spot, since their bunker is delayed quite a bit by going CC first. I don't try and kill them, just make them feel super awkward. Then I transition into the standard game. Alternatively, you can take all your probes off gas, and go nexus before core. I don't have much experience with this so I won't comment too much, it's just the other end of the spectrum.
***

**THE NITTY GRITTY** *(or what separates a good opening from a great opening)* **:**

In this section I'll be going over very specific details of how to execute this build. I've included a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8ov91Y5p9E), where i play through the opening in a FPVOD. It's vs the computer, and i made sure that i wasn't able to get into the terrans base with my scouting probe. Any decent terran will wall you out anyways, so it's best not to rely on getting into the base. If you're a lower league player, you don't need to focus on this section immediately. Once you have correctly done all the basic steps in the previous section (ie: not missing chronos, not forgetting anything, etc.) you can move onto this! 

1 - Chronoboosts. Fairly simple here. Chrono on 10 supply, 12 supply (just before your probe pops). For the 15 supply chrono I like to queue up my 16th probe, and chrono exactly when I get 25 energy.

2 - Nexus rallies. To get the tightest and fastest build possible, you need to make use of nexus rallies. The probe that builds your gateway should be rallied from the nexus at 12 supply. When it pops (13 supply) you build a gateway and scout, without taking any mining time away from other probes (that you've carefully stacked on the close mineral patches). Your next nexus rally will be on 15 supply. Use this rallied probe to build a pylon, and send it to your gas gyser, which should be finishing now. At the same time you should rally your 16th probe into your gas gyser, and take only 1 probe off mining to put into gas. After rallying to the gas gyser, you want to rally your 17th probe to build a cyber core. As you can see,  from 15 supply to 17 supply, you only take one probe off mining, and gain a few extra minerals. An optional rally is on 21 supply, you can rally to build your 3rd pylon. Not really necessary at this point though.

3 - When your zealot pops is approximately the time an scv will be in your base. If there is, set your zealot on him and forget it (until it's scouting time). This prevents the scv from building a bunker, or some other such cheese. If you don't see this scv, scout the inside of your base, all the way to the edges, then the natural. If you STILL don't see an scv, patrol around the entrance to your natural. You really don't want to miss a bunker going down, that is not good. I know i didn't do this scouting in the FPVOD, it slipped my mind because i knew a computer wasn't going to bunker rush me. &gt;:)

4 - Your first pylon, and subsequent buildings should ALL be as close to the nexus as possible, to minimize the amount of minerals lost when the probe isn't mining. The exception to this is the third pylon overlooking the natural.

5 - Scouting with your zealot + stalker. Think of the zealot as a meat shield to keep your stalker alive. If it's a 2 rax, you want to sacrifice the zealot to bring the stalker back home. Always go up the ramp FIRST with your stalker. You'll notice in the FPVOD that i click halfway up the ramp, then move my mouse down to get ready to run away ASAP. The stalker has more shields, so i want it to tank more damage. If you see no bunker and 4-5 marines, you can sacrifice the zealot for some marines. If you see a bunker, run away. can't do anything. If you see nothing, go up to his main ramp and do the same thing. If you see a bunker and no marauders, it's probably a 1-1-1. 

6 - Mining close mineral patches. As soon as you can, you want to be stacking your probes on the close mineral patches. This really helps to smooth out the small gaps in probe production that happen.

7 - Building placement. In the early game, you really need to be putting your buildings tight together. When you have time for it, it's always a good idea to have a neat base. This gives you a lot more room to work with in the late game, when you're dealing with 2 drops, his main army, and you need to drop 8 gates. Take the time early game, and you will thank yourself late game.

I was surfing r/sc and saw a thread asking how to start playing more games, so I started responding and it turned into a whole guide, and then I realized not a lot of people have a good set way of doing things. So I thought I would write a guide that personally works for me.

**Intro**

Just like working out, you can't start at 30 games, you work up to 30, but what you need, good sir, is a way to do reps.

Here is a formula, cause people love the shit out of formulas:


**The Warm Up**

1. Play 1 game vs the AI. Play as slowly and smoothly as possible. Don't click randomly and extraneously.

2. Play 3-5 games on unkranked now using the same principles as before.


**The Planning**

3. Alt-Tab out of the game, and start thinking about what you want to actually practice today. Think about how you just won, or lost, or what specific new thing you want to try. Right it down and think about some ways to go about it.

4. Take a 20 minute walk (around 4 blocks) and think about your games and your goal for today. Concentrate on breathing.


**The Practice**

5. Play 3 games on ranked.
6. Watch said games.
7. Right down a quick improve on each of them.
8. Take a walk around the block, actually go outside dammit. And stretch those hands while you're out there.

Rinse and repeat until you get frustrated.


**The Cool Down**

9. Play 1-3 game of anything else but 1v1 ranked or arcade games. I suggested doing cheese builds or off racing on unranked, or playing 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or ffa.

10. Think about your games for the day and write down a little note for tomorrow on what you might want to practice.


**Theory Behind the Practice Schedule and Explanation**

At the minimal, you end up playing 6 1v1 games, 1 ai game, and 1 fluff game. At the most, you can fill a whole day with practice.

You start with an AI game so that you can start by ignoring off the scale crazy builds. Starting this way paves a clear mind state once you start playing against real people. 

You play as slowly and smoothly as possible to warm your hands as well as to bring your APM down to the necessary requirement. Just jumping in at maximum velocity is how many people get injured in sports. One of the causes of arthritis is caused by frequent repetitive movements of the hand. Be sure to take care of your hands, stretch them, warm them up, etc. Spamming APM for spamming sake also spams into your muscle memory for actually necessary movements.

You play the first 3 games unranked so that you don't worry so much about ladder points. For many of you it won't matter if it's unranked or ranked, but do it unranked anyway. Just to get into good habits. Even on a very subtle level, it does affect you.

We go into the games with an open mind here so that we can look at all possible weaknesses we hold. Don't worry about what is acceptable or not. Cheese, micro, macro whatever, just choose and build and then engage, focus on playing slow and smooth.

Once you're done we watch and write about it. Just doing that alone will improve your games by 2 folds. You want to set up a goal for the day so that winning isn't the only thing that matters. Smaller more realistic goals let you go beyond wins and losses and make you focus on things that can actually improve your skill.

The first twenty minute walk is important. Every other walk afterwards can be shorter, but the first one sets your mindset into a constructive mode. It gives you enough time to calm your mind and think about the things you want to work on, reinforcement of goals is just as important as the practice.

When you start doing the reps, be sure to take breaks every 3 games. Also make sure you aren't distracting yourself with facebook or youtube and calling it a break. If you are streaming, it's okay to talk to your audience but be sure not to get distracted out of the scope of the game.

The reason we don't want to be distracted by other things is the same reason people training for marathons do not just stop in the middle of their run and start eating McDonalds. Your mind is in a certain mode, and to break that mode will not help you in gaining more will power to do more reps later.

To reiterate, the replays help you notice your weaknesses. Writing quick notes let you go back later and see what you were thinking at the time. The walk lets you reinforce your goals for improves.

Finally the games at the end are for fun. If you end up frustrated, there is less chance you will want to play the game the next day. You have to garner rewards and you have to have fun to want to come back and do something. Doing ""stupid"" things in the game will help you calm down and put less pressure on yourself. I suggest doing 3 games of this, not just 1.


**Other Tips**

Once you get to 8+ reps a day, you can start thinking about interval training as well. This will allow you to start powering through games quicker, but also keep a good focus.

Try playing 3 games once, and then 5 games, and then 7, and then back down to 3. If that turns out to be cake, try going up all the way to 11. I encourage that after each set, you take longer breaks to study and walk.


If you are not already auto matching to Elite AI I suggest you play the AI for the first 3 warm up games, and then play unranked for your reps. There is no need to start your practice with ladder anxiety. The AI maybe slightly stupid but it does force you into much better mechanics.



If you find it hard to get about a certain amount of reps, try splitting your practice into 2 sections. Be sure to do a cool down and a warm up though.


Hope this helps you guys.

1366673991.0,24,self.starcraft_strategy,1cwd24,Terran the Night Away... More Thoughts on Terran Bio Play,bauski,24,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1cwd24/terran_the_night_away_more_thoughts_on_terran_bio/,"Wow have you guys been on r/sc today? That place is drama filled to the max. I felt my life being sucked out of me. I'm so glad there are still starcraft related subreddits I can go to, other than mama's drama land.

So today I think I'll talk about what I've been doing in each match up and share the things that have been working well for me, and some pit falls I've found myself in.

*The Build Skeleton*

1. 1 Rax to Expand and then a gas right after.
1a. Tech lab for combat shields.
2. 2+ Rax and then the 2nd gas is taken.
2a. 2 reactors for marines.
2b. If Against protoss 1 more tech lab and 1 reactor instead.
3. 2 staggered engineering bays for 1/1
4. Marine push at around 8 minutes to test their strength.
4a. Expand while pushing
5. factory, starport, armory and 2 more gasses

From there on out it really depends on what the other person is doing, but this build is very safe, mildly quick, and overall just middle of the road, which can be good sometimes, and bad other times. 

*Why 1 Build?*

The reason I have been sticking to 1 build against everything so because I have been trying to focus myself on improving tiny skills right now. The more restraints you put on yourself, the more you can focus on the things you have in your control.

If I had too much freedom, I would be worrying about too many different things each game, and would lose my practice. With this focus on 1 build I guarantee you that my lower skills have been getting better.

*Some of the Things I feel have Improved*

1. My Game sense is much better.
1a. My timings have become crisper.
1b. My compositions have become more refined.
1c. I see their weaknesses and openings and lot better now.
1d. I have become less afraid of pushing out and taking map control.

2. My macro has also gotten better.
2a. Less supply blocks because I know when my population will boom
2b. More command centers for expansions.
2c. Better late game management of upgrades and production.

3. My army micro has definitely gotten better.
3a. Forced to use small groups in my timings to be economical.
3b. Forced to deal with strong tier 3 armies with my bio balls.
3c. Ghosts are key if you want to beat some late game stuff.


*Timings*

**Marines**

Because of the build I've been doing, early game pressure with lots of marines has been really important. Against Zerg this has been very key. Both as a defense against early game pressure as well as pressure against greedy zergs, the combat shields timing has forced my zerg opponents to slow down on their economy.

Just as a side note, just because your 14 marines leave at 8 minutes, does not mean they have to die out there somewhere, and as you're moving around, if you need more units, you should definitely try to combine your armies as you can. The bigger the mental pressure you build on the zerg as he delays his 3rd or loses it, the stronger footing you will have.

If your marines even survive until the stim timing, even better. Then you can probably even guarantee more damage, even perhaps in their natural.

But remember, the goal is not to do damage and lose units. The goal is put on pressure and save units. As your upgrades go up, your marines become that much more valuable. The longer they live, the better you're off.


**drops**

Because of my movement with my marine stuff, I've been doing less drops recently, which I am very sad about, because my very first reason for turning terran from random was for the drops. I've recently been using drops much more for end game moments. 

One specific instance that has paid off every time is the late game drop after a big battle straight into the zergs base. Especially around tier 3, zerg bases start getting all sim city in there, and maze-y, making it harder for them to surround my units. Around that time I can pump out so much of my bio ball at once, that I don't feel bad about doing a semi-doom drop of 4 or 5 medivacs full of stuff, leaving them there, and when the zerg starts walking in, just leaving the guys and jetting my medivacs back home. With that much stuff, the pool is going down, the warren is going down, perhaps a spire, and perhaps a ultra den. It's a lot of fire power, and they rarely handle it optimally.

Protoss have been more of a problem with drops, especially with my close to base they play these days. Once they're at 3+ bases I've found it easier to drop, but many of them are over making cannons and what not, making most drops not really worth it. I think if I refined my drop micro better, it wouldn't be so bad.


*Build Order After Step 5*

I wanted to explain my over all early game and mid game strategy before we went into step 6 in my build order. It heavily depends on my army surviving and me knowing what kind of stuff have made because of my bio ball. Normally it doesn't change very much these days though. Apparently there is no 1 real answer to bio ball, so zerg and protoss both do whatever they like most.

From Zerg I have seen a lot of muta, ling, bling, although I've been pushing them so early these days, that they seem to have trouble getting the mutas up recently. I have no dealt with roaches and hydras much.

From Protoss I have seen either the early 3 gate push, the quick expand into speed zealots and archons, or quick colossus. Once in a while I get crazy people who do a 3 gate push, and then go into oracles, and then go into robo, and they usually do a lot of economic damage against me, but I feel as I get better with my scouting and timings, I'll learn to defend against it with no problems.

Either or, if I go against linglingZerg, or zealot heavy Protoss, I've been skipping widow mines and just making hellbats. With zerg I do less marauders, and with protoss I do more, but either way it's been really good. And since a lot of Zerg's who go muta ling-ling have been going ultras at the end, I think I'm going to try and go ghosts for my late game as I do in protoss. I'm going to see if snipe can put down these freaking ultras even with the way old snipe nerf. I have yet to find a good way to kill all of them at the end. The most success I've had against ultras has mostly been base trading.

[Here is a video from Team Liquid to help you and me with proper ghost management](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=155732)

If Ghost turn out not to be the answer against ultralisks, I'm going to have to find some other method of taking them down. I have yet to find a good counter though. I'm praying so hard for ghosts to be the counter.


Against Protoss ghosts have been incredibly helpful. The cols I can take care of with good macro and production but high templars can destroy my bio ball like no other. The games where I have won with good ghosts have been incredibly satisfying. I am still kind of reluctant to make ghosts too early, but I am getting better with them bit by bit.


A friend of mine has suggested I slowly try to introduce mines into my build so I guess I will try to at last make 2 each game, but we will see how well it works.


Hope this helps somebody out there.

Where I am coming from (high plat/diamond player) is that I never can seem to pull of a successful one base early aggression play anymore. Nor do I ever see any pro's in replays do so either. I quit playing for maybe 2 months so I'm sure the metagame shifted drastically. Back then it was super common to pull a one base all in and based on micro/the build your opponent was going for it made for an interesting early game.

Example old school build: 
Protoss:
One base 4gate
Terran:
3rax stim push
Zerg:
Eh they never really one based successfully.. but their successful early game pushes were 7 roach rush or bling roach bust I suppose.

Are these kinds of builds just archaic now? I play random and so I often try various builds on all races. And honestly, I have probably lost every game where I tried early pressure. People are just really defensive now early game. It's all about the build up your base, get lots of defensive buildings, hit the 10 minute mark, and then get a 3rd or think about a slight push. Most games now are very macro and long term oriented.

Any thoughts here? Or maybe I am just missing the point all together and there are some strategies left that are successful in the current meta :)",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_vakqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/vakqh/is_one_base_early_aggression_out_of_the_question/,
1323925840.0,24,self.starcraft_strategy,ndese,ZVZ Eco 10 Pool Build,glabius,30,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/ndese/zvz_eco_10_pool_build/,"I've been doing this 10 pool opener ZVZ every time for about 30+ games(mid masters) and its been extremely successful for me but its also somewhat punishing if you aren't highly aware. It's been my go to opening for zvz on ladder because it stops all the cheesy zvz openings and can do damage to a 14/14 or 15 hatch. 

**The Build**

10/10 Drop Pool
2x drones (1 extractor trick)
11/10 OL
11/18 x3 zerglings x1 Queen
16/18 x1 zergling
17/18 x1 zergling
18/18 OL
18/18 double extractor trick for second queen
18/26+ DRONES 
in response to whatever the other zerg may do
20-26/26 take a Gas.
20-26/26 make Another queen if you see units Start to come towards your base
20-26/26 begin spine at edge of base for extra ramp defense and to move down to your inevitable expansion

2nd Queen should start right after the 1st queen (with a double extractor trick) 


**Concepts of the build**
1. The 10 pool build will stop all forms of Cheese. When I do it and the opponent 6-9 pools, they normally gg at the sight of my 10pool and base.

2. Significant damage can be done to a 15/15 hatch/pool and 14/14 Gas/pool. If you Kill at least 2 drones I would maybe call it even, if you Kill 4+ consider yourself ahead.

3. You force your opponent to make lings while you are making drones from a faster injected hatch. When they see your 10 pool in their base their response is shit shit make lings. Throw your lings around their base the whole time while you macro. They will make more and more lings while sitting at maybe 12/12 drones expecting Another all in while you sit behind 16+ drones after your wave of lings

4. Queen blocking and Mass queens. Most certainly your opponent will think ""well his all in failed, time to go Kill him"" The early queen is so that you can take both queens and block the ramp with multiple transfuses rendering his bust useless while you sit at 20+ drones on your base compared to his 12-16 drones

tl;dr kill at least two drones with 10 pool. force an all in, defend all in, win because more drones

**Other good general ideas to go along with this build**
1. Keep an overlord at their Natural, you need to know if they expand or not after your 10 pool

2. Send a drone scout if you can't find the location of their base with overlords or educated guessing.

3. Keep making queens, they're a good all around unit and if you have excess minerals its not a bad idea to make more.

4. Start creep spread with your second queen to move to the Natural (I recommend only one creep tumor because you will want the energy for transfuse later)

5. Try to expand, this is an eco 10 pool for a ReasoN. If you can get up an expand (when you know their all in won't be successful. DO IT. Make sure you have the creep spread for your 4+ queens.

6. If they went 15/15 expand after you do damage to them (you should be able to take out at least 4 drones versus a 15/15, don't sit on 1 base.

6. Be prepared to be all inned or cheesed later back.


**How to respond to...**

**Mass ling/Baneling on 1 base** - If after your 10 pool they try to bust you with Mass ling or baneling, keep making queens (with your two queens already blocking ramp) make a spine near your front (Which can be transferred later at your expansion anyway) and drop a roach warren/evo chamber and get +1 meele. Don't waste too much Larva getting lings because queens should be able to hold your ramp, destroy him in your drone count compared to his because he's spending all his Money on Larva. TRANSFUSE TRANSFUSE TRANSFUSE

**Mass ling/Roach, no baneling (1-2 base)** If your opponent goes Mass ling, but doesn't try to break the front with banelings (and will normally fail at attempt to bust ramp, and attempt to expand behind failed Mass ling) drop an evo chamber and get +1. +1 speedlings will decimate his lings and roaches that are probably about to come out sooner or later.

**Fast Expand** Probably the strongest response to this build (Which no ONE rarely ever does because they are expecting a Super all in. Expand yourself with a sort of protoss-esque wall off with queens couple spines and evo chamber with hatchery to make a wall. Play it out like you normally would zvz.

**So your 10 pool was succesful, their all in didn't work and your ahead eco wise. What now?**

Keep scouting his base, he might be going for a fast lair (a lot of the time) for mutas or burrowed roaches or something because he know's he's behind. Keep making queens and get a lair yourself. Mass queens are good versus any sort of Cheese they can throw at you via lair tech.

**How to lose using this build**

1. If you lose your Queen block (and you dont have a third queen or lings to back up, its probably gg. Try to save up energy on queens if you feel you have to for transfuse and keep producing queens and drones/lings. Keep a limit on the lings because they can't help in dps if its a queen blocked ramp.

2. You send lings to the wrong base. 

3. You keep making lings instead of drones after initial ten lings. If you keep making lings its just more of an all in. This is an eco 10 pool. If you keep making lings you turn it into a shitty 10 pool all in with no gas making it even suckier.

I have been playing as Terran and using a basic MMM drop strategy that has worked well for me, and I have been doing my homework on how to push MMM into late game. However, I have always been a Zerg player at heart. I've played a couple vs AI games to try and figure out the new zerg units, but there's so much new stuff it's a bit overwhelming. What are some good basic Zerg strategies that will help me learn the new units? I'm kind of hitting the wall learning curve wise and don't want to play a ton of games getting owned until I figure it out.

Any other tips or strategies are very welcome. Also, not many of my friends play, so if anyone wants to learn me up a bit, I feel like I'll be pretty capable once I wrap my head around the new units. Take me under your wing! :P

You have to have a reasonable number of cannons per mineral line [at least 3 for each 8-10 mutalisks] to adequately give time to defend [even with blink Stalkers] against the harass, plus you need to invest heavily in Pylons to ensure the cannons remained powered [ie. a smart zerg will just target a singular pylon powering 3 cannons and then you're out of luck]. On top of this, you have to grossly overpower or cannon your production facilities, because a quick snipe can possibly depower 1-2 structures with only a couple pylons, or a longer snipe can depower 5-6 structures if you have 3-5 pylons powering them, especially once the mutalisk swarm gets to the point of 16+, where pylons are sniped fairly instantaneously. 
The other issue I have is the Sim City problems. Moving in and out of your base is always a pain due to the nature of PvZ where every build requires that you ""turtle"" to a degree and this makes dealing with mobile air incredibly difficult. Any zerg with half decent control will be able to kill things in your base and you just have to accept it.
So blink stalkers seem to really be the only option, but the issue there is that blink stalkers are extremely cost ineffective vs zerglings, which are the mineral dump unit of the zerg [in a vacuum, 3 zerglings can kill one stalker quite easily, although vacuums are not good places to test, the idea of 75minerals for 125 minerals and 50gas explains why using Stalkers to defend zerglings is a bad idea. But either way, the issue I have is that Stalkers vs Mutalisks is a pretty even fight unless you have the numerical advantage. A horde of 20 mutalisks can definetly dispatch 15 stalkers in a straight up engagement WITHOUT zergling support. But alas, the issue I'm having is not dealing with them in an engagement, it's the complete void of map control once mutalisks are out for the remainder of the game which allows zerg to comfortably expand at will while Protoss struggles to get a third/fourth up. Even blinking forward to snipe mutalisks by catching them out of position is rather futile, because you end up mildly injuring 4-5 mutalisks and they heal constantly. So what should I do? I can't sit with stalkers and cannons in each mineral line and stay on 2base hoping the zerg forgets to expand. I can't hope that he blindly engages without zergling support into my entire stalker based army, nor can I expect him to not use his mutalisks and their incredible speed to exploit every tiny nook and cranny that invariably exists in my defense.

I don't want to say Mutalisks are imbalanced, I really don't. I'm of the opinion that regardless of balance you should be able to win if you're just better than your opponent [especially in the diamond/low-master area] but I feel like anytime the zerg goes mutalisks, he's able to pick apart my defense and crush me and I have no reasonable way of dealing with it: especially since Colossus is my natural tech path and getting one is useless apart from observers once mutalisks are out. If you have sentries in your army, you can guardian shield and then a moderate group of stalkers can actually deal with mutalisk in a straight up engagement [assuming no zerglings] but even then one volley from a reasonable number of mutalisks will instantly snipe sentries. So what should I do? Open double stargate phoenix until Heart of the Swarm and I get the tempest? Go storm and hope the zerg is dumb enough to leave his 120HP mutalisks in the storm for a full second so I can get 20 damage on them, while he snipes my templar for 150 gas each? Or should I hallucinate void rays and hope he insta-ggs? It feels so hopeless.

1366242663.0,21,self.starcraft_strategy,1ckj6z,Thoughts as a Terran for the Month of April,bauski,25,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1ckj6z/thoughts_as_a_terran_for_the_month_of_april/,"This might just be drivel, or this might help other Terrans. I don't know.

Wow Muta-bane-ling is hard. They have so much map control. Watched a Daily today, it's been a while since I've done so. It had a lot of pretty damn useful advice from the [DayJ](http://day9.tv/d/Day9/day9-daily-573-liquidtaeja-tvz/).


**Some key stuff I found useful in the daily:**

**A Game between 2 mobile armies, map vision is key.** It lets you know where you can harass, which makes the opponent react to other places, letting you come in and deny specific things or destroy key structures.

**As a mobile terran army I need a good place to cut back to.** Taeja was always cutting back. He also had a really good map sense in knowing where to hit and make lines. Again Map vision is really huge.

**The Production buildings are the back bone of a Terran army** It was kind of mind opening for Day9 to say that. It made me realize how important it is for me to know what stuff I had back home and what kind of final army I was going for.


**A bunker with marines and some nicely placed supply depots maybe much better for defense than widow mines**. Day9 talked about it in his daily and I think he's right. I would much prefer to have a bunker for defense I think.


All in all I found it to be quite a good daily.


I also watched GSL Code S, Round of 32 Group E Today. Damn that was a good group. Innovation and Gumiho were a great pair to watch for. Now having watched the daily I kind of want to watch again to see what I can pic up but they sure were enjoyable matches.


It was interesting to see the amount of drops that Gumiho was trying to use, and also failing at most of the time. But the guy didn't give up. I think if he could have saved more of the drops, and had been less greedy it would have been even better.


**Saving Medivacs is IMPORTANT. If you can save the units inside, BONUS** Too often I just rally my medivac and then just let it go and die. I don't think I should be doing that anymore. Anytime I'm doing a drop I should go over to that side of the map and make sure that I'm not just letting medivacs die.


Kind of along the same lines: **Don't over commit to attacks/harass.** There is never a good reason to try gamble your way up to 12 drone kills while losing 6 hellions. Cause it might lead to 4 hellion losses with no drone kills. If it's too dangerous just back off. But in cohesion with this idea I think it's important to **always keep prodding at the outside for weaknesses**, especially with your fast units. I mean, why not right?


**Drop Harass with 6 marines and 1 widow mine vs Zerg** Oh man, when Innovation started doing this, it looked so good and it looked so right. I think I'm definitely going to have to try this.



Sadly I can't remember much else from the GSL. They were some very enjoyable games though. Definitely worth watching over again. I'm becoming really fond of Terran.



Lastly somethings I want to focus on today when I get home I think. I mean, beyond the points that have been raised today.


**I need to make 3 build orders to stick to** I only switched to Terran after having played Random for so long. I've just kind of done things in a reactive way and just focusing on macroing better, but I've begun to realize that if I want to improve farther, I'm going to need to structure my self more, take out the random things more, so that I can improve systematically in the small things. 


I've been, generally, starting with 1 rax expand on all three games. On maps with easy jumping all around I've also been trying reaper harasses and practicing juggling between micro macro but without a solid build order to try and get to, it's just been all sorts of willy nilly stuff.


Against all three races I will be wanting to go for a bio drop kind of play. Once they get too overly defensive then I""ll have to push into a kind of parade push. So I'll be focusing on two different kinds of attack method.


So I'll need at least 5 rax by 2 bases, and probably 8 rax by 3 bases. I'm also a big fan of the siege tank but I don't know how useful the tank will be against protoss. Their value in TvZ and TvT is crucial though. Liquipedia says tanks can be useful against Cols and Stalkers and early gateway pressure but after a while against immortals and archons tanks become useless. So maybe I'll start with tanks in TvP but then switch into a full bio army with hellbats instead. I hear hellbats are quite good against zealots.


*Siege Tank vs Mines*

I want to get better with mines, but I'm still unsure of how to use them properly and I don't think I want to add that extra pressure right now while I try to get my build down. I'll just leave mines on the back side for now. Maybe place some next to turrets vs oracles, banshees, and muta harass but that's about it.


In fact, thinking about it, I think I'll start my factory, in all three matches, with the reactor, pump out 6 mines so that I can place 2 at each of my bases and then either go into hellbats or tanks. (I am unsure of how sure I am about this strat, but we'll see after a couple games)


*Upgrades*

So lets see, 8 rax, 1 factory with tech lab or reactor and a starport with a reactor. Since I'm getting siege tanks a bit later that means I'll have enough gas to start getting my upgrades a little bit earlier. I'll want to get my combat shield with the first 100 gas, so that I can do some timed marine pushes early on. I've found those to be quite helpful. Then I'll want stim aftewards, and then I'll be going into factory and starport. I think I'll want to start my upgrades before I start putting down my factory. I think even without healing having 11 marines with stim can be quite deadly in sketchy situations.


*Timings*
But the early marine pushes, and upgrades means that medivacs will be coming into the game pretty late. I'm betting around 11 minutes. As soon as I get my first two medivacs I should be sending them for possible drops and I'll probably want to expand right them. So I should build my 3rd in my main base around my first marine push timing.


Around my 3rd expansion is when I'll either be hit by mutas, which I can deal with my mines now, or when I can find out what build tech Protoss is going. This is also probably when I'll be getting my armory so I can start producing hellbats if the Protoss is going zealot archon heavy, or switch to seige tanks if they are going colls.


While writing this I've realized how reactive this all sounds. ""If he does this, if she does that, blah blah blah."" I'm trying to get away from the reactive play and here I am trying take account for all situations again. Stupid.


Lets go back to the 11 minute mark. I'll have pushed with marines once, or at least used them to scout their front, and by 11 minute my 1/1 upgrades will be done, I'll be going 2/2, and I'll have just put down my third base and out down 2 mines behind my base.


What do I do from there?


What can I do to take control of the game and force Protoss or Zerg? Drops will be good to keep them on their back toes, but what is my main army going to be?


Well, I mean, I guess I'm keeping it bio forever, so the only thing is to question what I'm adding into it for different build...


I think I'm going to keep it really simple for now. If TvT I'll go tanks, if it's TvP I'll go hellbats, and if it's TvZ I'll go either. I'll try and see which one makes more sense for me.


So I think I've figured out all the things I want to do...


**TLDR**

The following will be what I practice for the next couple of weeks:

1. Try to have/keep good map vision

2. Have a good strategic location that can easily access many places.

3. Use Bunkers for Defending bases

4a. Harass constantly

4b. Value units over dealing damage

~~4c. 6 Marines and 1 widow mine~~

5. Push Marines at 7,8,9/make 3rd in base, get upgrades, Expand when the drops start

6. Tank against Terran, Hellbats against Toss, and either against Zerg",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_1ckj6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1ckj6z/thoughts_as_a_terran_for_the_month_of_april/,

What do you do/tell yourself after a difficult loss? Not being outplayed per se, just knowing that you had an advantage and threw it away completely. 

 I just played a PvT where this guy did a miserable 2rax - I crushed it, moved out with two colossus, but somehow his MM circled the other way and was at my base instead. I slowly dragged my giraffes across the map, cleaned up that army, and pushed forward again. This time, he's got two medivacs in each of my bases. These are all his units. I can handle one drop at a time, but I have to drag my army back. I don't lose that much, but this is on daybreak and he's got a medivac floating between my bases, and two outside my main, and probably another outside my natural. I know these are all his units. I've got like 15 zealots, 4 colossus, 8 stalkers, an immortal, 50 probes, and he's got like 25 scvs. Slowly, but surely, I can't put stalkers and cannons in enough places, and every time I move out I can't defend 4 drop locations. In the end, I totally had that game in the bag from the very beginning, but threw it away because I played poorly.

What do you do after sloppy mistakes like this to stop yourself from being on tilt?

While I post here all the time and play a ton of SC2, I too have battled ladder anxiety throughout my gaming career. Even though I am now Masters, I was Diamond for 7 seasons and coming Top8 diamond multiple seasons in a row feelsbadman.jpg. But, the way I made it was basically by accepting I have ladder anxiety and practically working around it so I could still succeed. I did this by practicing my macro against AI and in the YABOT, by playing custom 1v1s, and by slowly ramping up the amount of 1v1s I play. 
  
Here's what I did daily to get the promotion. Try it out and see if it helps you get the skills you need to be promoted.  
  
Day 1: Research and pick one build per matchup. Use it for this training regiment.    
Week 1: One hour of macro practice on YABOT and against the AI.  
Week 2: 30 minutes macro practice, 3 1v1s (custom), 1 ladder  
Week 3: 15 minutes macro practice, 3 ladder 1v1   
Week 4: 5 ladder 1v1   
  
Total amount of ladder games: 63 , Total hours macro practice: 12, Estimated total time: 20 hours of play over 4 weeks = 5 hours a week. This does NOT include team games, which can be useful additions to your improvement if you play FOCUSED on improvement. Rather, these 5 hours a week are STRICTLY FOCUSED ON IMPROVEMENT.

I've been playing around with some of the new units and trying to figure out a few builds incorporating them. I realize that there will be many changes before even the beta begins, but crafting these strategies helps me understand the match-ups and core mechanics of the game. 

I'll share two of my own. They are both related to one another in that one can be used to transition into the other. 

The first involves a fast lair (after securing an expansion and possible third with regular queen/spine/speedling/baneling defense as necessary). While upgrading the lair, I build a roach warren and evo chamber and start storing gas as if I am planning on building Mutas. When the evo finishes, I research the +1 range attack. When the lair finishes, I research the roach speed. Then, I grab all of the gas I have accumulated and make about 3-6 swarm hosts (depending on how much gas I have). Then, I make roaches non-stop. When I accumulate enough, I move across the map and siege up either the third or the natural, using the swarm hosts to help bolster engagements. My reinforcements are mostly speedlings and occasionally roaches. If they go for a quick third, they almost always die. If they tech to air (banshees, voids/phoenix, or muta), I scout and retreat and transition into my next build.

This one can be an extension of the previous, but does not have to be. It basically relies on roaches in the midgame to secure 3-bases safely. It relies also on quick and consistent range and armor upgrades. The goal of the build is to get to hive and build a strong, well-upgraded army of the following: speed roaches w/ burrow, swarm hosts with longevity upgrade, speed hydras, infestors, and vipers. The roaches, hydras, locusts, and infested terrans benefit from the upgrades, and this composition works well against all three races. Now, it is micro-intensive using both vipers and infestors, but the two work very well together. The viper can help nullify colossus and siege tanks with abduct, and can also use the blinding cloud in conjunction with fungals to force very favorable trades for my largely ranged army. The idea is to hit this early(ish) hive timing before the zerg gets any semblance of brood lords and before carriers or crazy amounts of tempests. It is my late game army, and is more mobile than the traditional brood lord/corruptor/infestor of most late games. 

So what are your strategies? (For any of the races).

TL;DR - Make builds around range units rather than ling/bane/ultra, or corruptor/brood lord/infestor. ",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_xwvho,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/xwvho/what_are_your_strategies_for_the_hots_cutsom/,

Once you know you are overrun and can't escape, focus probes.

This build is generally safe. It can hold off 3gate robo all-in, 3gate stargate all-in, and others, as long as you respond with appropriate bunkers and such. You are powering up and so will have a good amount of units.

It is strongest against middle of the road tech builds, and very fast Templar tech (with sufficient micro). If they go very fast Colossus, you will be pushed back as the first Colossus will be out by the time you hit.

Most important part of the build is the pressure. Losing all of your marines for very little puts you pretty far behind. To avoid this, make sure you don't get forcefielded too hard.

---

I likely am leaving some parts out. Later parts of the build are quite game dependent, based on what your opponent is doing, e.g. it is possible to get reactor starport pretty quickly for 3colossus pushes.

This is also my first time doing this sort of thing, so it may be insufficient, but feel free to ask me in TeamSpeak (server.valdegames.com) or here!

Hope this helps.

1367597415.0,21,self.starcraft_strategy,1dmj5z,How to Learn from Professional Games,IsomerSC,30,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1dmj5z/how_to_learn_from_professional_games/,"Hey Starcraft Strategy,  
  
It's been a long time since I wrote anything here. I was a Masters Zerg in WOL and did a bunch of casting, now I'm back to talk about learning strategies from professional games. This is deceptively simple, you need to keep in mind that pros are meta-gaming each other AND that their build orders have numerous variations that they go into reactively.  
  
The first thing to understand about professional matches is that players understand each other's style and are often-times ""meta-gaming"" each other. This means they do a build which is specifically designed to have a timing against their opponent's style from previous matches. Sometimes, you see an overall ""weaker"" player cheesing a ""stronger"" player, which follows if they feel like they can't win in the long-term (Nestea vs Inka finals was basically all Inka cheese for this reason).  
  
Does this mean that if you steal their build order it won't work on ladder? Of course not. Any professional build order will work better than doing random things which are not optimized by a top 100 player. However, the main problem with copying a build-order straight up is that you might not be aware of the meta-gaming going on.   
  
The second thing to understand is variation of a build order. Each pro build order has a dozen or more variations based upon what he scouts. This is crucial because every ""build order"" you see is really a variation based upon scouting information. There will be a skeleton or frame, such as Nexus-first Forge Fast Expand into Stargate, but in each game the execution might change slightly, maybe one game he gets a void ray, another game he hides his phoenix before moving out, another game he sends them individually. These are situation-specific variations that you'll only truly comprehend by watching multiple executions of the build.   
  
If you watch Day9 analyze someone's build, he always looks at the variations of the build. So, let's say it's PvZ and your 9 pylon-probe scout sees a Hatchery first. If you have the 13 forge down, you could cannon the hatchery or you could go Nexus - Gate - Cannon because you know he won't have the faster lings. That's a variation. There are literally dozens of variations each build could have, from slight changes such as the order of the buildings you produce, to large changes like deciding to go all-in or to switch unit compositions.  
  
So, when you steal a pro build order, **start by blindly executing it against an AI**. Once you've done that about 5-10 times, you will be ready to play it against humans. You will start to see the strengths and weaknesses of the build, which is where variations can help you. You can now go back and **watch the scouting of the pro player** and you will be able to understand the reason they go into different variations, which will teach you how to react and go from a build-order copying machine into a reactionary human!  
  
Cheers, go destroy some people. I'd recommend this site for build orders:  
  
http://www.gosubuilds.com/  
  
It doesn't have variations, but if you use the same build every time, you will naturally move into mid-game variations on your own. Plus, Nose usually links games or at least provides the player name, so you can look for their variations yourself.

Posted it there first and got downvoted/a bunch of replies saying ""Don't."" or ""Switch back"". Too late, already been playing Terran for 2 weeks and having a blast.


Anyways: for example, it took me months to realize that you could simply hold z or d to build multiple zerglings or drones when you had larva selected. That whole time I was spamming zzzzzzzzz or ddddddd to make multiples.

Also it took me a couple weeks to learn the whole fast queen injects thing. Example: Select your queens, hold shift, press v to inject, then press backspace, click, backspace, click, backspace, click to quickly cycle through hatches.

So basically what I'm looking for is Terran tips along the same vein. What are your tips/tricks? Feel free to post them for other races too.

Edit: I'm familiar with the general strategies/game mechanics as I've been playing since beta as Zerg.

Edit: Not really interested in comments saying ""Don't"" or ""Switch back"". I know the popular opinion nowadays around here is that Terran is underpowered. I know that, I watch almost every game in every major tournament and keep up with all the podcasts as well. I still think it's just a matter of waiting for the meta to evolve a bit more. Also, even if they were underpowered, that wouldn't stop me from wanting to play them.

Do you guys have any good resources to help me understand what to look for?  Like, if Protoss/Zerg has 2 gas, 1 gas, or no gas.  Any advice would be great because I feel like this is my biggest struggle right now and preventing me from learning how to build better armies.

Hi, diamond zerg here.

Recently I have started trying out my muta/ling ZvT style in ZvP, and it seems like overall the build is extremely powerful, perhaps even a little bit overpowered. I have not seen any standard play so far that beats this without me making huge mistakes. Typical mutalisk responses like storm, archons, and blink stalkers have been unable to do much. The biggest difference so far that I have seen is that this style of ZvP plays extremely different than other styles I have used in the past. It is not geared towards greedy play (like most zerg is) and actually is quite safe because of this. Currently the way I play it is: 

-Extractor trick into 11 overlord  
-11 Pool  
-15 Queen  
-17 2 Zerglings  
-18 Overlord  
-18 Gas  
-Expand  

From here the build is more or less fluid. You mine 100 gas and get ling speed, taking 2 drones off gas. You lay down at least a spine or two to prevent early harass/pressure while fully saturating your 2 bases. Around the time you are fully saturated on minerals, your gas will get close to 100. At this point put 2 more guys on gas, take your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gas while teching to lair and keeping saturation. During this time extra minerals should be going towards a small number of zerglings, an evolution chamber, and spine crawlers. Additionally place a spore down if you think your opponent is going DTs.  

Once lair completes, lay down a spire and start massing overlords while keeping your mineral count even with your gas for mutalisks. Once the spire pops, start +1 attack and start massing mutalisks. Your 3rd should finish at which point you should begin to saturate it while giving priority to mutalisks. Also, do not feel you need to go super drone crazy with this. In most of the games I played until I had my 4th and 5th up, I was behind in workers. If you have gotten to this point, you should be able to win it relatively easily (against normal unit compositions).  

Once your mutalisks are out, the gameflow typically consists of your restricting your opponent to 2-3 bases while mass expanding with spines, spores (if needed. A few in key spots to prevent DTs are always good), and making sure to upgrade your mutalisks. For upgrades on mutalisks I typically get a 2nd spire about halfway through my first carapace upgrade for double ups. Just continue building your flock, do critical damage to their infrastructure when they try and move out (tech buildings, pylons), since your spines will buy you the time you need to do the damage. From there destroy their army and remax.  

Now I have been testing this against my diamond/masters protoss buddies, and here is the list of things that we have found really does not work:

&gt;Mass Archons/HT  

By the time you get any significant number, the zerg player can be 2-3 bases ahead and will just trade armies with you. Even if they do not trade cost effectively, they should be able to with their greater income. Additionally, storms do little good against good mutalisk players since they will always keep their mutalisks spread and make sure to magic box. The best situation you will be in against proper control is you will have to storm your army since his mutalisks are parked above you.

&gt;Mass Phoenix  

This does not work for a few reasons. The first is corruptors. 6 Corruptors will ruin phoenix, especially if the zerg player has been getting armor upgrades. The key for the zerg player is that they just keep the corruptors between your phoenix and their mutalisks. When I get home tonight I will toss on some replays, including one where my opponent went mass phoenix.

&gt;Standard Gateway  

This composition as a whole is not flexible and really cannot deal well with mutalisk harass.  

&gt;Mass Upgraded Blink Stalker  

This composition does the best out of all of the ones so far, but is unable to both prevent harass and put pressure on your opponent (unless you are doing the robo-blink 6 gate all in).

&gt;Mass Sentries

Good for fighting off small-medium numbers of mutalisks, but after that are not very good. Additionally, they are slow and do not deal with spine crawlers well.  

&gt;6 gate  

With the delayed third and the large number of spines, a protoss player would have a very, very rough time breaking through before mutalisks were out.  

What may work:  

&gt;Blind stargate openings.

My friends are not very good with stargate openings, but this seems to be so far the best opener at least. It bypasses the large number of spines associated with this style, and is able to hit before mutalisks. Once the spire is up unless you did critical damage they will be able to fend you off, but there is a good opportunity to deal massive damage and get ahead.  

&gt;Blink stalker/phoenix.  

You may be asking yourself why this would work if mass blink stalker and mass phoenix by themselves would not work. The reason is because the following playstyle I describe is far different from styles currently employed by protoss. First of all, you are shooting for a sort of counter-harass style. The general idea is that you get air attack and shield (not armor) upgrades and constrantly skirmish with your zerg opponent. You open 2 base stargate against your opponent and tech to blink. Instead of getting a massive army early on you get enough sentries to hold against more common openings (ling/roach, roach/hydra) and a very high number of warp gates. You are pooling production like zerg pool larva. Meanwhile, you are making large numbers of phoenix and expanding. Should your zerg opponent show up with mutalisks, warp in 10 stalkers for them to deal with (along with the cannons that are already there) while getting your phoenix back to that location to help. Once the threat is diverted, use those stalkers to go counter-harass. And please note that I have been unable to do much testing against this style. In short, it is theorycraft.  

So how are you guys going to counter this? And please, no ""but if X he will just Y!!!!"" comments. With how strong mass mutalisks are in the current metagame, there is no reason to switch yet to any other unit composition.

Many of you have not seen these mythical beasts in any game, so lets run down their strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:

*Very high DPS -  *26.7 DPS, and it goes up by 5 every upgrade. Very potent.

*Tough to kill -  *Base 2 armour, 300 HP and 150 Shield.

*Easy to kite with -  *The interceptor mechanic allows for engagement from 8 to 12 range

*Cost -  *Taking into account build time and strength, relatively cheap.

Weaknesses:

*Tech requirements -  *Needs a fleet beacon!

*Build time - *120 seconds - longest in the game.

*Speed - *Sluggish, hard to run away or chase enemies.

So, with that out of the way: Usage!

So far the only good strategy I've found is as a counter for mech Terran, i.e. a tank push. It also works relatively well against 1-1-1  builds, although you'll need some detection.

Against both I go 3-gate into stargate, then hide the fleet beacon anywhere on the map. A single Phoenix will let you scout the enemy base and see what exactly they are getting - also makes a great banshee deterrant. Ideally, if the Phoenix doesn't run into Marines or a turret, they will assume it was a hallucination.

If a one base tank push is coming, you can generally get a single carrier out in time to counter it. The tanks will drop very fast to interceptors, and the combined Gateway blob and carrier will mop things up easily.

If a 1-1-1 is coming, A FE with a cannon at each mineral line will keep you safe from Banshees, plus the Phoenix from before. Get a second stargate and crank out carriers. Once you have 2-3 you can generally push. Note that Carriers will eat up vikings, until they have enough to one ro two shot the Carriers - If they've been going that hard into Vikings, your ground army will win.

A note on upgrades - I have found Armour to be better than Attack, since Marines and Vikings are the primary enemy of the Carrier. Increasing armour from 2 to 3 makes a big difference, especially if you have you Carriers with your ground ball, benefitting from Guardian Shield. Effective 5 armour makes them really hard to crack. As for damage - it's nice, but interceptors will kill Marines in one pass regardless, and Vikings in two. 


For PvP and PvZ I haven't found anything useful yet. Too easily countered by Blink Stalkers or Corruptors.

I want to talk about ZvP as it is currently my favorite matchup to play and watch as both races. What's so crazy to me about ZvP is how it has been entirely flipped on it's head in HotS. In Wings of Liberty, the meta-game for Zerg was broodlord infestor turtle after passive 3 base plays, whereas Protoss pretty much either did an all-in on 2 or 3 bases or they played a macro style with mothership core. The macro games then came down to if the archon-toilet went down properly, which was really frustrating.  
  
In ZvP now, though, you have more gateway expands, more air play, more hydras, ultralisks, more aggression, and more back-and-forth games. I'm going to talk about how the pro ZvP's are playing out right now, focusing on sOs vs. Soulkey Ro4 from the GSL.  
  
From Protoss's perspective, the first important decision in the game is whether to gateway expand or forge fast expand. This is usually decided by the map, for instance if the 3rd is easy to take you see more gateway expands because you might delay Zerg's third with this and then you can transition into a faster third base yourself. If the 3rd is hard to take, then you'll probably see more forge fast expands, as Zerg is more likely to put on aggression because their third looks less safe. Also, if they do take the third on these maps, getting the fast upgrades from your forge are an important aspect of your 2-base allins.  
  
For gateway expands, we are seeing mostly a quick Nexus after your gate-gas-core. From there, you can take your 2nd gas, throw down 2-3 more gateways, and put on a pressure if you see Zerg has taken his third. Basically, you just go with mothership core, get up a pylon, and warp in zealots while going tech behind it. The goal of these pressures is to eliminate Zerg's third base with just mineral units, since you care more about your gas at this point as you're already probed and now you're just teching up at home. You also see a number of different kinds of pressure with the MSC, like 2 stalker pressure or zealot/stalker pressure.  
  
Forge expands are still fairly popular. There are plenty of 2 base allins you see after forge. There are the old ones, like 7gate or immortal-sentry, but there are lots of new ones like 2-colossus 2-immortal or voidray-zealot.  Many are strengthened by the mothership core, which can both recall if things get hairy or use time-warp to great effect.  
  
Briefly, let me talk about the influence of the MSC on the matchup for Protoss. In WOL you had to play a lot more passively in the early game without the MSC. It not only gives you great offensive capabilities, but it also can save your ass against a lot of allins. Nexus cannon is a critical ability for Protoss in early and mid-games in all matchups, which is important because it allows Protoss to play styles that were simply unsafe in WOL.  
  
So, during the mid-game, what are your options as Protoss? In my opinion, Stargate is the best way to play a macro style. It gives you Phoenix for harassment, to force spores and keep Zerg pinned back. At the same time, it allows you to make VR if you scout a roach-allin and it allows you to make a transition faster into Skytoss later.  
  
Skytoss is going to be the answer in about 50% of games, whereas in other games you will be using a Colossus-centric style. This is sort of like the difference between mech and bio in TvZ, the styles are very different, play at different speeds, and in some respect, they could be ""stylized"" to meet your own playstyle.  
  
Different playstyles I've seen: voidray-centric styles with some gateway units underneath, 2-robo colossus (against swarmhost turtle), the Tasteless Build (cannons/tempest/storm), balanced compositions like chargelot-archon with lots of harass/warpin, and so on. I actually believe that Protoss is the race right now which has the most stylistic play at the top levels. MC will bash people down with tricky and aggressive timings, Parting is a sort of macro-pusher and relies on Bomber-esque pushes and his ability to make great tactical decisions and forcefields, etc.  
  
From the Zerg perspective, things are pretty dynamic. You can go hatch first if you watch for cannons, double-hatch before pool if you think he's going Nexus first, pool-first to be completely safe from cannons. The thing is hatch-first is stronger than it used to be because more gateway expands are going down, which are very weak at punishing the hatchery-first play.  
  
The thing is this: if Protoss takes gas, you need to take gas. Gas means he can attack you, either with a pressure or an all-in. Thus, you need gas for zergling speed, Lair, roach speed, upgrades, and potentially hydralisks. Hydralisks are way better than they used to be with their speed upgrade and they are powerful answers to all kinds of all-ins from Protoss (particularly force-field centric ones like immortal allin).  
  
If you want to play swarm-hosts, you should get zergling speed and zergling upgrades. In the midgame, this allows you to spam zerglings with all your excess minerals and have them be effective harassment units against the Protoss, who is likely to expand quickly and sit his army somewhere in the middle if he sees you're going swarmhosts. He knows you're not going to send the swarmhosts past your spines, so he can position his colossus to deny locusts from hitting his 3rd/4th bases without fear. This is fine. He will eventually go air or storm against you, so you want to get some more tech up to supplement your swarmhosts, like infestors or vipers. Air upgrades can also be useful for your corruptors if he starts mixing in VR or tempest.  
  
If you want to play muta-ling, it's really quite similar to WOL. You just get a fast 5th/6th gas (don't need to fully saturate mineral line at 3rd, though), get zergling and mutalisk attack upgrades, and after your initial clutch of mutalisks (7-8), you will be able to take a 4th/5th base. Put these bases as far from each other as possible so there's less of a chance of losing them both. You really will want the extra gas for FAST transitions between mutalisks/swarmhosts/ultralisks. Tech transitions are basically the scariest thing about late-game Zerg. Utilize them against Terran and Zerg as well.  
One thing people transition into from this is muta-corruptor. It relies on heavy air upgrades and sometimes you will want to mix-in infestors if he's going mass phoenix.   
  
Late-game Zerg I think should include swarmhosts or ultralisks. These are better than broodlords or MASS mutalisks, in my opinion. Protoss is better at handling mutalisks because of the MSC and the increased phoenix utilization relative to WOL. However, ultralisks are very strong now with their buff. Swarmhosts are like better-broodlords, really, because they spawn their locusts from a very large range and allow you to siege-push bases without having to make mass infestors to protect your broodlords. This creates a dynamic where Protoss is now trying to out-multitask you with warp prisms. Then there are beautiful dances between HT and vipers. There are just so many interactions that can happen in late-game because Blizzard has strengthened so many units that people are pretty much using all of them now.  
  
So, overall, I'd say that ZvP has gotten more interesting at all times during the game, with pressures and different opening styles in the early-game, many more different compositions, and a late-game that's much more interesting and variegated than WOL. I think Blizzard really improved the Protoss race with the MSC and Skytoss buffs and it's helped PvZ look so much better. I hope you guys enjoyed my commentary on the matchup, let me know if you want one on another matchup.

*This isn't necessary to read but it does help give context to what I talk about later*

TvZ has been butt easy these days, if butts are easy. With my 1 rax expand into upgrade marines, I can parade push all day and just destroy zerg either with marines vs zerlings and banelings, or with added marauders to take down the roaches.


Sadly, this was also the build I was doing against **Protoss**. Here are some things that made this stupid impossible.


1. Protoss does not expand faster than you, mostly. So there isn't much you can push into that's not well guarded.

2. The Protoss defense force is huge. Marines vs Gateway units, no contest, gateway units win. So there goes my 8 minute 16 marine push. And after that timing there are very rare situations where greedy Protoss may not get enough units, but usually they will always have a stronger army set.

3. You have to get Marauders to deal with Robo stuff. So that cuts into my gas and money for my 16 marine push anyway.

4. TvP is very gas heavy, so much less marines now.

5. The longer you let them make their army, the better their army gets.

6. Late game Protoss has great AOE damage.


Because of these problems, I had got into my mind that the only way to deal with this Protoss shenanigans was to expand ahead of him, get my 3/3 bio death ball first and destroy his composition with good scouting. Good idea in theory except for the point #5. I played two games last night on the ladder against Protoss and because of excellent scouting from me, I knew exactly what kind of army he was getting. I was ready for this shit. I got my medivacs, I got my vikings, I got my upgrades, I got my stim, concussive shell, my combat shields, my ghosts, etc etc. Then we had an engagement. Then we had another. Then another, and over and over I kept losing more and more as his army slowly pushed forward trading blow for blow a lot better than me. In the end I was smacked down into my base. If it wasn't storms, it was zealots with charge, or cols, or archons, and there was just no way, after a while, to trade efficiently.


So I showed this to my friends before our weekly Round Robin King of the Hill and they asked me why I didn't drop. No, that's not right. They insisted that I needed to drop. For the rest of the night as I played my games against my Protoss friend all I did was practice my drops and the things I learned last night, I'll share with you guys today.


**DROPS AND THEIR PROS**


The first thing we have to understand is the ""WHY"" aspect of drops. If we lose our ""Why"" then we'll start executing our build and battle strategy wrong and that leads to sadness and anger. (both of which are mind killers).

So why do we drop? Think of it like going against Zerg. When you are going against Zerlings and roaches, then you're all about taking it head on. Let them come, we don't care, with a little bit of micro we can get the best engagements and trade efficiently every time. But once the Ultralisks come out, **you stop engaging in the front so much because your necessary APMs go up a huge amount and the trades become inefficient.**

This is the same thing with the Protoss army. Depending on the compositions you can take less micro necessary, and efficient trades sometimes, but over all, the idea behind the Protoss army is the death ball, once the trades stop being efficient, the key is not to attack them directly, but to start hurting them where they can't be.

Because here is the thing: **Just like ultras, the bigger the army gets, the slower it will be to react.**

So now we have 1 good reason for dropping: ""When army to army engagement factor is too much of a loss for you, fuck that shit.""


Here is another good reason: When a Terran starts putting on pressure early game with drops, there aren't a lot of ways that the Protoss can deal with it. Templars aren't out yet, unless he went straight templars, in which case feel free to ignore drops and just push into his base and kill him, and blink has not been researched for stalkers. So he either must get blink, put down a bunch of static defense, or keep warping in units to deal with your harassment. All of these things are to your advantage.

Why? Well, as Tasteless said a couple weeks ago in the GSL, stalkers are finesse more than brute strength, and the more you force them to pop out stalkers, the weaker their final death ball is going to be. They also cost a bit of gas and minerals, slowing the Protoss down from upgrading and teching as he would like to. 

If the Protoss decides to put down a lot of static defense, that's even better, because that leads to 2 possible situations. He has openings, in which case you can still drop in the holes and then destroy his static defense still putting him back, forcing him to make more static defense, or he over makes static defense in the back, at which point you fall back to ""I'm going to run in your front now, and just kill you.""

The third option is a popular method of defense: defending by warping in warp gate units. Its effective in the early mid game as a defense, but as the drops become heavier and heavier, the Protoss cannot get enough units out to defend properly. And if they do warp in too many things, you can always just take your guys and leave, making him waste more supply on gateway units, slowing down his tech and upgrades.


So now we have our 2nd reason for dropping: ""If I drop a lot on your, you'll die because of greed or slow down to a crawl because of defense.""


And looking at the ""whys"" now we can see the pros of dropping. This way, you never have to take losing engagements, thus having more money to spend for production and better compositions for yourself, and you'll be keeping the Protoss on the back foot. Win win!


**TIPS ON DROPS**

So yesterday as I was dropping on my friends, I started thinking about some rules that I should follow for my drops. Some of them are good ideas and some of them are bad ideas, but these are some things that I wanted to share with you guys. These rules build upon each other, so if you read one and you think ""but"" or have a ""what"" you can always real the previous rules and get a better sense of ""why"".


*1. Know when you drop*

Without scouting this is useless. If you 1rax fast expand like me and then start focusing on getting your drop going, you're doing it wrong. I lost a game yesterday cause I was thinking ""TvP drop time"" instead of realizing that he hadn't put down an expansion and that he had gone 3 gates first. The blink stalkers came in with the mother ship core and I was too busy already thinking 2 steps ahead. Always scout, always know when your enemy is weak, or what he is planning next. If you scan his army, and you have an overwhelming victory, then just push it. Remember that we drop because Protoss usually has a stronger/bigger army, but if that's not the case, there is no reason not to.


*2. Drop early and don't lose it*

If rule #1 has been fulfilled then this is step 2. Surprise him with your first drop, make it early and put him in a defensive mind set. If he over makes stalkers right now, super fantastic, the earlier in the game he has to make gateway units the longer it will take him to start teching. The first drop isn't for damage, it is to set the pace of the game, and to make him over anticipate. Kind of like a jab in boxing. Not a knock out, just a feeler.

As an acilary thing to mention, if you every pass by a pylon, take that out first. The benefits of map control are too good to pass up.


*3. Drop slow boost out, save medivacs over rax units*

When I first started dropping I was so anxious to do scary fast attacks with damage that I would boost in and drop in. Sometimes I would be lucky and catch him by surprise, but sometimes his army would have not moved since the last time, and now there was no speedy way to run away. Losing the rax units wasn't so bad, but losing the medivac was horrifying. Now, I slowly move in, slowly drop in, and then load up and boost the shit out of there as soon as I see that first stalker. It might not do as much damage, but it still forces him inside the whole time.

Don't forget that saving medivacs also means sending your red medivacs back to be repaired. Sometimes when I'm playing really well, and I have enough command centers around, I'll even just leave 3 SCVs on the side of the map, half way from my place and his, so that I only have to go half way (which is the equivilant of 1 boost) to repair my ships.


*4. Don't commit just cause you're there, scoot around the perimeter""

Sometimes I just push in cause I get to the outside of his base, and I end up going through 3 cannons and dropping 1 marine before my medivac explodes. Does that sound good?


*5. Static defense, workers, pylons, tech(robo bay, temp archive, twilight, forges, robo, cyber), nexus, gateways, units.*

From highest to lowest priority of things you will want to destroy. Static defense first, because it'll bait him to make more, thus losing him more money and ensuring your own escape and entrance paths. Why workers are 2nd is pretty obvious. Pylons are great for two reasons. You might be stopping production, you might be stopping tech, but you'll always be slowing down supply and unit making, which is key if you have to deal with army to army engagements later. Tech is obvious. Stop his cols, stop his high templars, (infact archive might be better than cols cause then he can't feed back your medivacs), stop the blinks, the stop charge, 3/3 rax units will defeat slow ass 3/3 gateway units any day.


*6. More prongs the better*

There are 3 reasons to do multi-prong attacks. The first is that it spreads his units out more, possibly giving you better engagements. The second is that it lets you deal more damage if he tries to deal with each prong separately. The third is that it gives you more time for each drop as well. Where as he needs to use his APMs to decide which to take care of, or how to spread, and then move and engage, you just have to drop both and then take care of some business at home before flying your medivacs away.


*7. The heavier the drops, the less he can commit to a push*

One drop isn't that much. If you're dropping you will always have less units then him at home. So if you want to keep him inside, you have to give him good reason to stay inside. I usually do my first drop, 1 or 2 medivacs, and then I add a prong, and then I add more medivacs to each side, then I add another prong. If you have 3 prongs of 3 medivacs each, you've probably won the game by then.


*8. At some point he will just say ""fuck it"" and push at you. Drop and lift your shit.*

Base racing sounds kind of scary, but it really isn't that bad. Especially if you've been destroying his infrastructure the whole game. By the time he starts trying to kill of your stuff, you'll be destroying his home beyond repair. And since you've been so cost effective this whole time, it's a breeze as you lift up your stuff and run to other sides of the map, and start a couple of command centers at different places. With medivacs and bio, marine scouts all over the map, you will always find his stuff first, and kill him before he can even destroy one of your bases.



**WARNINGS ABOUT DROPS**

Well now that I've sold you on drops, I wanted to finish this article up with some warnings and tips so you don't die because of an over emphasis on drops. I'll be re iterating some points I've already gone through, but I thought it would be useful to get into specifics.


1. If he's going air first. Don't drop, just push in and kill him at around the 8 minute mark. If he went air first, he will not have a mothership core, his gateways will only be finishing up, and with 3 rax of stuff you'll just kill him. If he goes air later to deal with drops, treat it like mutas. Bait his phoenixes out to some land away from his army, drop down your marines and take care of them. I've found that having pockets of marines near your drops can also help in this situation. If he over commits on phoenix, once again,  just in from the front and kill him.

2. If he goes really really quick high templars. Just push at the front and kill him.

3. If he goes really really quick dark templar. Build a turret and a bunker up at each base, continue drops, save scans for his defenses. Now he's wasting gas and minerals for defense like a mofo. Make sure to have a scan for your drop attack.

4. If he goes quick robo, drop, he is now commited to a very slow army which is ideal for drops.


**Final Thoughts**

Well I hope this helps some of you with your plays, and I hope it gets more people dropping. I'm not a very big widow mine user so I don't know how to incorporate them into the drops, but just remember that widow mines could potentially make them use more APMs and minerals, not to mention forcing them into specific build compositions, which is really a great way to take control.

I guess here is a quick TLDR for the really lazy

**TLDR**

1. Scout to know when to drop.
2. If the Toss army is strong, then drop.
3. More+stronger drops = slower production/tech + smaller army/econ
4. Save drop units, never try to deal damage for units.
5. If he ignores and pushes out, lift/rinse/repeat.

I've written a bunch of help/advice posts on here and this time I am going to try something a little different: describe the flow of ZvT in general, the styles popular in the upper levels right now, and how you can use the metagame. I am mid-masters NA at the moment, Isomer 729.  
  
**Early Game**  
In the early game, Terran is increasingly moving towards CC first. The reason for this is that as Taeja, MKP, and others have shown, even a 6 pool can be beaten by CC first if you micro it correctly. Furthermore, with the improvements to Queens and overlords, early pressure builds have fallen by the wayside as Terrans are increasingly looking to wins in the mid and late game. The most common transitions from the CC first are bio timings, marine/hellion, or hellion/banshee, all looking to hit the Zerg third while Zerg has few defenses except Queens up.  
  
From the Zerg side, the early game hasn't changed a whole lot since the Queen patch. 15Hatchery is used in basically all pro games, followed most often by a gasless third, a relatively slow speed, or some kind of 2base pressure build. If the gasless third is taken, Zergs are usually opting to go for 4-6 Queens and static defenses to help defend against early timings.  
  
Often, the transition into the mid-game occurs after a Terran's pressure onto the third of Zerg. It can either cancel it, kill it, or the pressure gets held.  
  
**Mid Game**  
If Terran went for a bio timing, they will usually stick with bio into the midgame, perhaps adding in tanks or not (MKP, Polt, and Taeja have used bio timings). Many Terrans favor adding in hellions with their bio to help against Zerglings as well as securing map control BEFORE that pressure, therefore they have the factory up already and can go right for tanks. So, like bio timings, marine/hellion can easily transition into marine/tank.  
If Terran wants to go for mech in the mid to late games, however, the hellion banshee style is by far preferred. Usually Terran will go for this via 1rax FE into reactored hellion and 1-port cloak (or not) banshees. 
  
From here, Terran can take a super fast third if they have done enough damage and start ramping up the factory production from 6 gasses.  
  
For Zerg's midgame, I would say it's usually a bit more reactive. While 6 months ago almost no one was using mutalisks, we are seeing a lot of players using max +2/+2 ling-bling-muta timings, which can be devestating but are ultimately rather all-in-ish because they are really hard to transition out of if you don't do damage (DRG and IdrA love to use this timing).  
  
Despite the slightly resurgent popularity of mutalisks, they are still a lot less versatile than infestors, so for that reason you will see infestors the majority of the time against bio and biomech styles. Infestor ling bling or infestor ling into faster hive are the two common styles to play. With infestor ling bling, you will be able to be more aggressive and can do big pressures onto the Terran third and then runby into the main, whereas infestor ling is inherently more passive, as you are teching up a lot faster and are intending to kill with Hive.  
  
If a Zerg sees mech, there are actually a lot of popular responses right now. Some Zergs will go muta if the Terran is banshee-hellion heavy, which can be pretty devestating as T can't really do damage with all this shit he invested into, plus he will probably take some damage back. Of course, if T transitions into more tech lab factories faster, then they can pop out a couple of thors and mutas become pretty useless pretty fast.  
  
Infestors against mech is popular because it transitions better than mutas. You want to get Hive against mech, so infestors are right along the way to Hive. They have more utility in battles than mutas, as they can fungal hellions and tanks in position, they can mind control thors, as well as spam infested terrans, which are really great if energy is plentiful and you have some units to buffer damage temporarily. Most commonly, you will see speed roaches paired with the infestors as lings pretty much get roasted instantly.  
  
There are a number of allins Zerg can do against mech, such as 3base roach drops or just 3 base roach spam with no tech. These allins seek to kill Terran off before they can get their tank count up. One innovation IM.MVP introduced was to make a lot of banshees, like 4+, which can really shut down a lot of these roach allins. 
  
**Late Game**  
Moving into max positions, let's talk about Zerg because usually Terran has to play more reactively in the late game than Z. The most important piece of information in the late game is ultras or BLs. If ultras, Zerg is going to be slightly more mobile and going to hit faster, which is okay as long as Terran gets up some marauders or extra thors/tanks and less air units. If Zerg goes BLs, Terran absolutely needs more than 1 starport already built so they can slam out vikings, preferably at least 4 at a time.  
  
The main dynamics in the late game are similar for mech, biomech, and bio styles: eliminate Zerg expansions with multipronged harassment because Z late-game army is slower than most T late game armies. Zerg really needs 5 bases to be able to reproduce a deathball, so if T can keep Zerg to 4 bases they only have to kill the deathball one time and then Zerg will have to choose between remaxing with cheaper midgame units or getting a much slower remax.  
  
Terran-wise, we are seeing Ravens quite commonly as hunter seeker missle is a great way to take on broodlords and packs of infestors. It's not uncommon for Zerg to have SIGNIFICANTLY more workers than Terran, as T can just get like 8 orbitals and slowly reduce SCV count. T can also choose to play defensively and go for BCs with planetary fortresses, though that's only advisable on maps like Metropolis where attacking gets really impossible in the late game.

1345582111.0,20,self.starcraft_strategy,ylljr,"Protoss trying to get into Diamond, I've hit a wall with my play",Dunador,23,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/ylljr/protoss_trying_to_get_into_diamond_ive_hit_a_wall/,"So as it says, I'm high ranked platinum (was top 8, though I think I've fallen, losing a lot of games to Diamond players).  I can't quite pin point my problem yet, though if I had to point at something, I'd say it's my inability to be flexible.  I have set builds I always try to go versus each race (details below).  I don't currently have any replays I can post (I'm at work currently), though I can add in more once I make it home.  

---------------------------
**Versus Zerg**

To elaborate on my flexibility problem:  for example, PvZ, I always open with a FFE (Or on some maps, a Gateway first expand, always a similar build though).  From there, I try to go into a 7 gate timing attack, to knock out the zerg's third, and take my own third.  From there the plan is to make double robos, and go into immortal colossus. I know that once I get this going, I have to push fast, reason being is once broodlords come into play, I struggle heavily, usually due to lack of stargate tech.  

However, if the zerg does anything funny, anything ""different"" than what I'm used to seeing (Which is typically a roach all-in after I knock out the third, that I also lose to a decent amount of time), I struggle, I lose focus, and am unsure how to respond.  Do I continue going for the colossus if the zerg decided to go for mutas instead of the roaches?  Or should I go into some sort of templar tech with archons?  What about large amounts of banelings?  I think I've set myself too hard in stone with the build I've practiced.  

Found a replay.  This is, as I described above, me trying to 7 gate pressure, into a 3rd with robos.  But I end up getting crushed by roaches.  [Here](http://www.uksc2.com/uploads/Reddit%20Replay%201.SC2Replay) it is for download.  

--------------------------
**Versus Terran**

I have a similar problem with Terran.  I have problems reading a terrans opening. Ive been taught if a terran takes an early gas (around 13 or so), that I should expect fast aggression, so I build accordingly (usually something like a 3 gate robo).  Lately though, as I'm playing diamond players, I find that this holds little truth, as they just expand anyways, and by the time my obs get to their base, I'm already behind.  

When I don't expect fast aggression for terran, I like to go for a 1 gate, cyber, expand, into 7 gate with HT/Archon/Charge-zealots.  Now sometimes I can catch the terran by surprise with this, and they wont have any ghosts to defend it, but most times, I get scanned around 8:30 - 9:00, and they start into ghosts.  I think this just falls into positioning and spreading units, but the ghosts man...they ruin any well laid plan I have.  

And lastly, the last problem I have with Terran, is when they do fast expand, but make for a fast push anyways, around something like 7-8:00, with something like 12 marines and 2-3 marauders.  At this point, I'm still trying to get my tech all up, and my gateways are just finishing.  It's just too much too soon, and I crumble under the pressure.  

-----------------------
**Versus Protoss**

Protoss is my least concerned race, mostly because I've just not put the time into formulating a strong opening versus Protoss.  Honestly, most games I just try to 4 gate and win, and 90% of the time I do (I'm pretty decent at microing low amounts of troops.  Larger armies, I struggle with micro).  If the 4 gate fails, I back out, expand, and go into a colossus-based macro game play.  If anyone can recommend a strong opening build to use in PvP, that doesn't involve 4 gating, since I know 4 gating is somewhat frowned upon, I would love to read up on it, and work on practicing that.  

Found a replay of my 4 gate.  Nothing special, but if you want to see it, [here](http://www.uksc2.com/uploads/Reddit%20Replay%202.SC2Replay) it is.

-----------------------

I apologize for the really long post, and if this needs to be changed to match the guidelines, just let me know and I'll get it changed.  I'm just looking to see where I'm going wrong.  All of the above was working fairly well all through platinum, but now that I'm playing diamond players, and other top ranked platinum players, everything is suddenly not working anymore.  'Tis quite frustrating.

Thanks for any help, in advance!

I'm not joking - though I have no illusions that this is some ""METAGAME CHANGING"" build or something, but it can be done, however you need to be crisp and very aware of scouting, and aware of ""army values"".

Opening up Stargate seems to work nicely on NA (I'm Diamond on there, was previously plat on KR) as not too many people around my level know how to deal with it properly. But you get a few Phoenix(nix) out, and as per [this game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs8NecsaFsA) between our local [/r/starcraft_strategy](/r/starcraft_strategy) member Xujhan - use them to scout out the lay of the land, and get a few kills.

However I decided to (and this originate on KR not NA) go a little further with it, and say ""what if I pretend I'm a zerg..."" and go for upwards of 10 nix to really try and harass my opponent and keep them in their base while I expand. Now I know this is actually the whole purpose of doing a nix opening, however most of the time people will get 3-5 or so, then stop and focus on ""normal"" units like robo tech and so forth. This goes for far more of them at the cost of ground units, which may seem strange however as you'll see in some of my replays here, with a large contingent of nix you can still defend things - providing you have **good scouting and army value awareness.**

After the nix opening, depending on what your opponent is doing and how they react to your nix, you'll want to expand quickly to get the third/fourth gasses up which of course are vital. You'll want to also chuck down 2, maybe 3 cannons depending on how safe you feel based on the scouting from the Phoenix. A robo can be handy to make sure you have 1 obs to remove enemy obs and lookout for DT's, however I've found that with very careful and studious cannon placements from an early forge; you can negate both of those things - however that's a personal choice, I've been on a cannon binge lately; getting them in large numbers in all matchups for fun.

There is a certain point where you'll probably need to defend the ""big push"" from your opponent who'll be annoyed at the way the play goes down - this is where nix control and keeping them alive the whole game is very important. You'll be down on ground units obviously because you've spent more on the nix, and hopefully you'll have the adequate cannon amount for what you scouted coming. Just lift ALL THE THINGS and do the damage you can, a couple of the replays below have nice examples of dealing with that first push. The great thing is - once you defend against it - you're in a great position. Because depending on how they play, the next push will come when a couple of the carriers are out and you'll be fine then, and then fine after that... and so on. :)

Anyway, at a certain point you'll want to get a second stargate - if your opponent commits to heavily defending the nix early in the game by building cannons (2 or more) in their mineral lines at the main/nat and/or going for high stalker count with blink - you'll need to be more careful with your nix because they need to **stay alive the whole damn game** because the harassment and graviton beam are crucial to your defense and ""time buying"" part of this playstyle - as I said, pretend you're a zerg droning up behind muta harass. :)

Depending on what you see, you can start Carrier production off the 2 bases - and as everyone knows, once you get to around 6-7 they are actually very hard to stop. You'll need to keep a constant vigil on what your opponent is up to of course; if you see him moving out, you'll need to prepare to graviton beam like a boss, put more cannons down, that sort of thing. Safe to say; if you see your opponent getting a third, you get one too. Once 2-3 carriers are out and your opponent hasn't taken one, you can feel safe in moving out to take yours because you should be fine to defend it.

Upgrades are kinda required, however obviously you'll need to be careful as to when you get them. If your opponent also opens Stargate/nix you might need to get +1 for armour/weapons quick, or one of those, just so you can make sure you have air superiority and also nice ups for your carriers once they are on the field.

I've had various responses to seeing some nix -&gt; carriers - ranging from quite odd - people getting templar and archons only (which is cute, you can feedback the nix obviously, but after that it's pointless) - to the far far more common mass blink stalker. Some people do an archon/stalker combo - in the end I think if you are at the stage where you need to defend against this you need to do one of two things: push out very early WITHOUT regard for probes back home, almost like an all in - however if you have a couple of cannons you should keep some alive - or get 3/3/3 and blink on stalkers ASAP. I'm not talking ""cool bro I have 3/3/3 at the 34 minute mark"" I mean super fast. Triple robo if you have to. Because the only thing that has really beaten me down with this is that one play, because obviously stalkers are nice and mobile, and with huge ups they will smash carriers even when carriers get close to the tipping point.

Another big weakness as noted in the seperate thread is that a blink stalker timing early on can really wreck your shit if it's done right. I personally don't feel that phoenix openings are ""way more vulnerable"" than any other style - it's a matter of how your opponent utilises their stalkers and their blink. But, I'll admit you can have trouble on maps where the main is open to blink-ins such as Korhal, Shakuras (just cannon rush that map imo) and similar maps. I'm yet to think of a ""simple"" way to deal with it, given that you can have trouble getting a decent ground army up because you're focusing on nix, but still. 

Extra side-notes to think about which you may want to think about for me because I'm lazy:

* Getting the nix onion-crystal upgrade can (no joke) be worth it sometimes. I've gotten it on a couple of occasions - it can really help if your opponent is being stubborn and still continues to get colossi with blink stalkers - keeping the nix out of range of the stalkers as much as possible is a huge thing. But again - the trouble I've been having with the build is dealing with blink stalkers, not with colossi.

* I have no idea what is the most cost efficient and useful for the air upgrades - I would assume that given the interceptors shoot twice you'd want to get weapons as a priority over armour - however if you're facing off against mass stalkers (which as pointed out many times is the **most common** defense) - you may want armour, given that it'll negate both parts of a single stalker volley. This needs some more theorycrafting 

* Chargelots are something that work quite nicely with the carriers as both a meatshield and also as damage dealers against stalkers. If you position them right they can be quite useful in blocking out the stalkers - or if you hold them under the carriers when stalkers blink under them to attack you'll shread them easily.

* Having a mothership can be very very nice of course, however personally I wouldn't recommend it. Interceptors will fall into vortexes, and depending on positioning and the gravity (no pun intended) of what you're dealing with, you can lose a battle from your *own* vortex. I'm not saying don't do it - just make sure you think very hard before you place a vortex down if you get to that stage. Mass recall however would be my use of choice for a mothership if you get to it, rush up to an opponent's expo, kill it, recall back. Similar to very very late stage PvT in Brood War. 

**Again with my little disclaimer: I'm in no way a pro at playing Protoss, I just like taking fun styles into my matches. I'm also not claiming that this will change the matchup at all, so if you bitch at me about ""RARRRR THIS WON'T WORK AT HIGH LEVEL"" expect me to not reply because I KNOW THAT. I do however think there's more potential than people give it, and if a scrub like me can do ok with it at a diamond level perhaps some of you masters guys might be able to work with it. Also worth noting that I don't have a particular build down - I play to what I see and also whether I'm drunk or not.**

Remember this last little piece of advice: This is a **fun** build, not a ""GET ME TO MASTERS BRO"" build. The aim is to try and have some fun practicing your phoenix micro, and also trying to stick one up Dustin Browder for threatening to remove the carrier. Also: **BE THE ZERG. HARASS WITH THOSE MUTAS(PHOENIX) AND KEEP YOUR OPPONENT IN HIS BASE!** If you keep your opponent in there and force him to screw around making many stalkers and cannons and such while you're spending the 8284 minutes it takes to build a carrier, you're in a good spot. Measure your opponent's army and calculate the cannons you need to defend if he pushes, and remember to LIFT ALL THE THINGS! if he attacks.

1333705447.0,18,self.starcraft_strategy,rw2yx,"Discussion on a ""standard"" way to play Protoss vs Zerg.",Nadril,21,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/rw2yx/discussion_on_a_standard_way_to_play_protoss_vs/,"So I've read through the [**PvZ Beating Stephano Style**](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=320894) thread on Team Liquid and I thought that we could use our own here on reddit to try and ""think tank"" some ideas.

Essentially what I hope is that between Team Liquid and us we can try and figure out a safe, solid way to play the PvZ match up. What do I mean by this?

* We don't rely on gimmicks. If your build requires you to snipe tech with dropped immortals, or to hide tech... than while it may be a valid build it is also quite gimmicky. 

* Doesn't rely on all-in's or massive damage in order to stay in the game.

So I think something that is maybe important (that I didn't see people discussing on Team Liquid) is to try and talk about the differences between **PvZ** and **TvZ**. I think it is fairly agreed that TvZ is probably the most balanced (non mirror, obviously) match up in the game right now. 

When I look at how players play TvZ they often use several very well timed attacks or pressure moves. Usually it starts off with the reactor hellions in order to gain map control and disallow the zerg from a super quick 3rd. Than they'll often times go into some sort of siege tank / marine timing before or as mutalisks are hitting.

Right now with PvZ our problem is that when we FFE we are essentially sitting ducks until like 8 minutes at the earliest. There is *nothing* that the zerg is afraid of before then. I think we lack the specialized timed attacks to force units and delay the zerg that terran have been doing.

There are a lot of people on the team liquid thread suggesting stuff such as gateway expands or the [**YufFE Gate Nexus**](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/index.php?title=Gate%20Nexus%20YufFE&amp;stable=0&amp;shownotice=1&amp;fromsection=Con%20features#Overview) build. Some have pointed to how [**LiquidNony plays the match up as well. (2nd game)**](http://www.twitch.tv/liquidtyler/b/311392240)

So lets discuss, what do you guys think the best way to go about this match up is? Personally I just feel that either trying to play super defensively or doing 1 tiny timing [like 4 gate +1 after FFE] just doesn't cut it any more. 

Also this isn't necessarily just about stopping Stephano's style, because we want something that can just be standard *safe* play. There can be changes based on what you scout, of course, but it shouldn't leave you super open to certain attacks or builds. (For example some people are suggesting stuff on the Team Liquid thread that would just get crushed by early 3 base mutalisks, or any attack before 12 minutes from the zerg).

* What's the lowest quality of post we should accept? How little detail does someone have to give when asking for advice before we consider it a ""useless"" post?

Just a bit of presentation, I'm an old guy from Senegal (let's say 40+...) who is quiet interested by trying this game .

I've watched some videos on Youtube (Apollo , day9) and also live streams. Let's cut to the chase I will not have a lot of free times to play ...

I will not bother you with the reasons but I was just wondering if any of the races can be play with a very defensive play style ? What I mean by this is just to let my opponent attack . I'm pretty sure I will never be able to do all the cool things I can see the good players do neither (controlling army and economy at the same time) so that is why I wanna know our opinion about a really defensive game-play. I am aware this is a strange question but will it be possible to win some games by doing this ? 

An other thing I'm kind of afraid about is the trash talk... Does it happen often ? Is there a way to hide the chat ? I really don't want to enter in this kind of stuff with someone who could be my child.

1337476146.0,19,self.starcraft_strategy,tvey8,Some general queries about Terran strategy I would love to see answered!,lilstove,23,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/tvey8/some_general_queries_about_terran_strategy_i/,"Hello all!
Considering how much this subreddit has grown recently, I thought it would be a good time to throw around some general queries I have in regards to terran strategy. While I plan on adding more later once I get a response, here are the first of several:

1) My first question is in regards to rally points, I tend to rally all unit producing structures to a point either in or just outside my base, and than shift-cue from that point to a unit in my army (preferably a sturdier one, tanks, thors,
battle cruisers, and the like), which constantly streams units to my army, unless said unit dies. If that is the case they will than revert back to the original rally point just outside my main, instead or remaining next to their structures or rallied to their death somewhere on the map where I have potentially just lost an engagement.     

That being said, I have often been told that this system is flawed in that it takes too much time, and is generally less efficient when compared to simply staying on top of rallies and changing them depending on scenario, rather than trying to use a universal rally system that tends to work in most situations, without the need to alter it often (except in the case of new structures being added to your control group.

So reddit, is my system in fact inferior, what do you use, and how would you recommend I change my rally style?




2) Viking production most commonly starts for terran players when colossus, broodlords, and other vikings need countered in TvP, TvZ, and TvT respectively. When watching pro matches, I've often seen terran players start, and continue to invest in air weapons upgrades despite their air force not necessarily being more than a small minority within their force. 

My question is, at what point in these matchups should I as a terran player start to think about investing in air weapon upgrades. Does it depend on a timing or generally how late the game is going? Should I gauge the timing of the first attack upgrade on seeing a specific number of collosus/broods/opposing viks? And what is a good method for knowing whether or not to continue with the second and third tier air weapons upgrades (avoiding the obvious answer of ""when all the units viks would counter are dead. Assume some of these units are still on the field, but the situation as changed in some other way).




3) Ravens. Pros rarely invest in them from what I can tell (with exceptions) despite their having what I see to be a plethora of excellent uses in many matchups. Examples include:

--Early-ish raven in TvZ to more efficiently slow creep spread, an ability  made all the more important after the queen buff

--Pdd against Protoss. From what I hear 2-3 ravens with a Pdd each can make a major difference against just about any army composition, considering the importance of a solid stalker count in most P builds. 

-- Raven/s + Vikings in TvT between siege lines lets you counter enemy vikings with Pdd even if you have inferior viking count, or the (lesser known and, in my opinion, underutilized) method of throwing down autoturrets next to front-running enemy sieged tanks to either absorb the initial tank shots as the rest of your army charges, or cause enemy tanks to inflict splash damage on each other

--Mobile Detection (DUH, right?) scans are awesome, but so are mules, Surely a raven with your army is more efficient than scanning whenever you need to see burrowed/cloaked units around your force

--Seeker missile. I'll include this here despite recognizing that Pdd is typically the more efficient use of 125 energy. Clumped marines get smashed by it. Using TvT as an example, players move back and forth between viewing their infrastructure and adjusting the front of their seige line, with alerts immediately drawing their attention. With a seeker missile, there is no warning (given in the form of an alert by the game) until the sucker lands, so wouldn't it be efficient to use one in that manner against clumped marines behind/around siege lines, assuming you have air control?

So, why aren't Ravens used more often? As in, almost every matchup, in almost every game. Is this something that actually IS used more often than I am led to believe, and I am merely naive? And are there other use for them I have missed? (excluding the outrageously fun but volatile mass raven strategy many a monobattle comes down to)



#4 MMM v Protoss. This may seem obvious, but humor me for a minute. While marauders are the staple of any good MMM build against Protoss at any level, sometimes I find myself wonder how many I should invest in compared to marines. Obviously, this changes depending on your build/ the opponents build, and how long the game was been going on for, but I feel like there is such a thing as too many marauders when compared to your marine count. 

Simple question: What is a good marauder:Marine Ratio in the highest efficiency MMM composition army I could get in TvP, and what other factors will force me to adjust this ratio (ex. he's going voids, get more marines)



Anyway, that's all I have for right now, I hope to see some good responses! If anything, perhaps some good discussion will come of this, as respectable debate and organized information exchange is something I don't think we see enough of on starcraft subreddits :)

Thanks ahead of time for the help, and stay classy!

TLDR #1: What rally style do you use, which do u think is best?

TLDR #2: When should I get Terran Air weapon upgrades for vikings specifically, and how do I know to continue investing in them.

TLDR #3 Why do high level players invest in ravens so little, when to me they seem like an excellent and efficient unit for a variety of reasons? 

TLDR #4 What is the ideal Marine:Marauder ratio in an MMM army against protoss, and what factors will force you to adjust this ratio as the game goes on?

Recently, I came across the phrase ""Finding a problem for your solution"" and, as is the case when I hear most anything, it made me think about Starcraft. I realized that this phrase gets at many bad mistakes made by amateurs and professionals alike: we make decisions without scouting properly and then we find ourselves in sticky situations because of it.  More simply, it made me think about the importance of playing reactively, not robotically. 
  
When I think of ""reactive"" play, I imagine transitioning based upon what you scout. Whereas, ""robotic"" play would be blindly following what someone else has done *or* blindly doing whatever you feel like.  
  
For lower league players (below plat), I would recommend blindly following the builds of professionals simply because until you have decent mechanics, having more units is more important than making the right decisions. This article is aimed at higher level players whose macro properly provides the foundation for playing reactively. 
  
Let us take an extreme example as our first, demonstrating one of many problems with robotic play. Let's say we are Protoss and we knew our Zerg opponent is six pooling. If we know this, going straight for a cannon and walloff or blindly going 2gate would shut down the zergling rush and give us a huge economic lead through chronoboost and probe counts. 
  
However, we know that when newer Protoss players open this way, it's often out of a misguided fear of these early attacks and they do not understand the terrible economic and tech position it can put them in. They simply do it to play passively and work on their void ray or DT builds in safety :)   
  
""That's such a noob build"" you might say. However, we are all guilty of playing robotically like this and, truly, if we come to understand the *precise* reasoning behind everything we do in the game, we would probably become GM level because we are making super baller decisions all the time 
  
Let me give you a precise example from my own play. In the Zerg vs Zerg early game, it is *essential* that you not make more units than you need, for this cuts into your drone count and weakens your mid and late game. Thus, you get only one gas geyser and you use the gas reactively. Constantly, you are looking at the mini map where your overlord is in front of his base. If you see a big wave of speedlings coming in, then you convert all of your lings to banes and delay your Lair and tech (upgrades, roaches). If you do not see these incoming units, you can slowly tech up on that one gas geyser, whilst droning up and not making lings or banes.  
  
Truly, there are hundreds of decisions that pro-gamers make over the course of a game, and it is impossible for us to blindly copy those perfectly because our two opponents will *never* play the same way. Thus, subtle variations in the information provided by scouting lead to subtle variations in the decision making of professionals.  
  
Thus, I suggest that everyone open up their last 1v1 game and look at every single decision you make. I'm talking about build orders, scouting patterns, gas timings, expansion timings, unit positioning, unit composition, transitions, etc. Look at each decision you make and ask yourself: Is this the best thing to do right now based upon what I have scouted?  
  
Dovetailing from that, I would encourage every player to scout more often and then to go back and look at your opponent's perspective in the game. What can he have at the times you are scouting? If you do this, you start to understand the meta-game, build orders, and what to look for when you scout.  
  
So, get out there and scout more often and always make informed, reactive decisions. ",,False,,t5_2smn2,1347116555.0,,race-z,True,t3_zj21s,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/zj21s/finding_a_problem_for_your_solution_and_the/,

Allow me to introduce myself.

I go by the IGN of ""Sako"", I am a huge fan of the Starcraft franchise and an avid player 

for several years now.

Here's an overview of my background with this game:

* SC1: 5k+ games, mostly BGH, LT and Python. 

* SC2: 2k + games. Diamond/Master League. 

**_____________________________________________________________________________________**

I have been browsing this subreddit for quite a while now and there seems to be a lot of 

players asking for tips and help. 

While most of them get the answers they are looking for, I feel like the same questions 

keep coming back every once in a while. 

That's when I figured I could help out some fellow redditors myself!
**_____________________________________________________________________________________**

Here is my suggestion:

* Send me your replays and the main ""question"" you want answered (i.e. How to counter brood lords late game) 

* I will watch every single one of them and add my comments as the game progresses, giving tips on what to do,
pointing out mistakes (i.e. bad economy, lack of macro/micro) and what can be done to prevent those mistakes 
from happening again. 

* I will then post a video on YouTube for every replay I get so you can watch my commentaries. 

* I will also post a reddit thread so that other redditors can keep track of the replays that are sent in.

**_____________________________________________________________________________________**


By doing this, I believe it is a much more efficient way to help this community improve rather than having threads, 

questions and replays scattered around the subreddit. You have literally nothing to lose! 

If you ever feel like I could improve on my commentaries, feel free to let me know, as it also helps in my 

understanding of the game. 

I know I'm not the best SC2 player in the world, but I think that by having your replays commentated thoroughly and

having other redditors joining on the discussion, everyone could improve on their gameplay and get even higher 

league rankings!

If the main is over saturated I can understand but often it isn't but you'll see pro's transfer some workers. (FFE for example) The only reason I can come up with is that sending X workers over delays the main from saturating as soon meaning you won't have to rally both nexus to your natural until later and moving 5-7 probes at once loses less mining time than filtering one a time every 17 seconds to another expansion.

However normally the time that this occurs the economy is weaker than later in the game when the player has significantly more probes. Meaning lost mining time is relatively lower to total mineral income. Normally I find the time to transfer is just when you want to be building a large round of production structures and those 5-7 probes in transfer delays doing this.

I'm just a gold leaguer I am sure there is good reason behind this but I hate not understanding all the games nuances. While 99% of SCII is very intuitive but hard to do effectively  scouting well gives information but doing it constantly while macroing and understanding what you see while scouting is a skill set.

I've crossposted this in /r/starcraft and /r/AllThingsTerran, so anywhere you go, hopefully I'll be able to get helpful feedback.

Now, I recently contacted the owner of gosubuild.com (a master toss player), and asked to help out with the Terran side of things because honestly not everything was accurate. In the past week, I've completely changed the TvT section - adding more than double the previous amount of builds and editing the ones that were already there to make them more efficient build order-wise and also fixing up transitions etc etc.

I was wondering if I could get some feedback from this awesome community on a couple of things. Feel free to comment either right here or on the website itself, for I'll check both of them.

* How do you like the layout on the page (ignore the web design itself - focus on the ordering/layout of the contents of a build order)?
* Is there any information that you think is wrong?
* When you look for a new build, are you looking for more information than is currently provided?
* How do you like the ""tutorial"" feature (they're just a collection of games vs a very easy AI where I perform the build perfectly with minimal micro)?
* What other builds am I missing to cover all of TvT? (I didn't include the 3rax with calldown supply or proxy marauder yet, because I'm not quite comfortable with transitions out of it ;D)
* Any other random comments/concerns/questions are totally awesome to hear too!

""Unscheduled"" events will probably continue into the night.

These events have been quite the success, let's continue that!

This will be how the overall event will be run:

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

• Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""

• Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes). A few events ago, there were a large number of Bronze/Silver/Gold so we had to make a BS and a G.

---

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available at www.teamspeak.com . Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is **server.valdegames.com**

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Lastly, streams will be available. 

I will be running the Plat/Diamond peepmode and organizing everything. My stream can be found at: www.twitch.tv/iechozz (not fully confirmed if I will be streaming)

Nose will be unable to stream this session; he is going to the Red Bull Battlegrounds.

First off, I am in in master's league, though I think I still belong in high diamond, so I hope this validates my questioning a bit. The title pretty much states it all. Whenever an early scouting probe or drone (rarely an SCV, since it seems as though Terrans respect each others' SCVs or something like that) I dread the possibility of it attacking my SCV making my rax. Against Toss, I don't wall off, so my SCV is right my my CC and it's less of an issue, but I still have trouble with it. Even if I pull an SCV off my line to attack the probe the entire way through, there are countless times when my constructor dies, even if I pull the constructor off the rax and attack with both of them. Against Zerg it's much more annoying. As long as the Zerg is aware of the drone and makes it run some circles around my base in order to regain 10+ hp, there are many times in which it manages to pick off my constructor. 

I never really asked anyone about it, since I thought that one day I would all the sudden figure out this issue, but I've been playing since beta and I've been frustrated the hell out because of this. One thing is for sure: you rarely see this happen in pro games, because the pros rarely get their scouts in super early, so there's a lack of good example as to how to beat this.

*About Strategy*

So recently my opponents have gotten smarter and better at their game, and I've started realizing that at certain points of the game I start feeling lost. It's nice having my build order, and I am able to always rely on that in a shallow way, for instance if a weird timing happens or some harassment comes, I can always flow back to my build, but my feeling of ""being lost"" has started to come up mostly, around the late mid game.

So as I was at work thinking today, I realized what I lacked was a clear strategy/style of play. I was giving myself mixed signals during my games. I mean, imagine how inefficient your game would be if you started out with a hellion drop, then switched to bio, then switched to mech, then bio again then air. You would lose. It doesn't make sense. Your drunk, go home. And if that last thing sounded funny to you, that actually happened to me, cause I panicked.

*A strategy is based off of preference and advantages and determines the rules of engagement and production.* That sentence explains why a strategy is important, and how we can go about making our own strategy. I had forgotten my preferences, ignored my advantages, and decided my own rules of engagements, and floundered and died. Like a chicken with its head cut off. Today I have decided to remedy this issue.


---

 
*Coming up with Rules*


Based off my previously write ups, we know my first preference: *I am going bio ball*.

What are the advantages to bio ball: Highly mobile. High DPS. Quick production.
What are some disadvantages: Needs a lot of APM. Highly squishy. Horrible for late game army vs army scenario, no matter what race.


Previously, I had been feelings of insecurity from my bio ball, and because I didn't want to admit my disadvantages, I tried to mix in tanks or widow mines, or whatever else to try and secure my base. But if a big late game army pushes at my front, I lack any way to win that fight. Unless I can flank them from the back and destroy them. So instead of trying to make my build more mediocre, trying to account for all scenarios, I should just push my advantage forward.

So since I cannot win against a big army push, ever, that means I don't have to try and keep a big ball of my army at home anymore. I can fully deplete my resources for drops and pushes instead. **Rule 1: I should be out there doing things instead of at home, being scared.** This also goes along with the ""highly"" mobile advantage of my armies.

Going by that 1st rule that I Have just instated, that means that I will want to get my build upgrades now. I've been forgetting about them, but now would be a good time to start spending my extra gas on these things. So that means taking more gas in late game now, which I'm fine with. I always have some extra gas geyers that are unchecked.

Also going by that 1st rule, now I need to expand more since at any point I can lose bases easily. The gas and expand one can obviously be put into one neat little rule now. **Rule 2: Expand a lot.**

One of my advantages to this army is how quickly I can make things. Medivacs, marines and marauders are cheap as dicks. (Dicks are cheap), so that means I should focus on harvesting a lot of minerals, and gas and continuously produce more stuff. **Rule 3: Maximize on production and production buildings instead of later game units.**


A 2nd preference that I have is in my comfort in defending in the beginning before moving into my early mid game drop/push mode.

The second part of that preference is already inline with our first rule, so we don't have to worry about that. What we must consider are about the first part of that preference and the unspoken part of the preference.

First, since I feel comfortable defending, then fine, we'll just follow the build as it is right now, and open safe while expanding early. Data wise, my games rarely end early anyway. And if I do 
lose, that just means I need more experience defending.

The third part, the unspoken part is this ""What about late game? What is my final army composition, what kind of engagement am I going to have, and how will I win?""

Knowing that bio-ball, in late game will lose almost lose every massive engagement unless place perfectly means that I now have to either decide to keep on bio-ball or change into something else. But to be honest I don't see a viable way of changing out of my mid game drop/push style. To start moving into mech means my outside bases, which I have gotten from rule 2 are dead, and all the production facilities I made from Rule 3 are now null, and rule 1 doesn't even apply. We can either change the rules to open up to a more flexible build, which in effect will dull the blade, or we can just through mech out. I will through mech out, but that's just my choice.

A second choice is air, but air also has the same problems, as well as the problem of being super weak to protoss high templars and archons as well as hydras, and vipers. So no no no.

That means that I will be sticking to bio all the way through the game. Which means, late game, there will be no direct 1v1 engagement unless I see myself heavily favored. This means that I will have to win by forcing the opponent into giving up or by destroying all of his unit production. By running away from direct engagement while destroying his production I will at some point end in a favorable engagement situation. That is the key.

From what I'm gathering here it means I will have to maximize the mid game as long as I can to maximize my advantage of harassment, speed, and slowing down his production, and then finally look for a key engagement to hit his army hard. I think there is a rule here somewhere... **Rule 4: Maximize mid game to weaken key late game engagements**

This rule automatically brings up another rule then. If we want to have the late game advantage earlier, then it means we must favor upgrades more than any other tech in more build. This also makes sense since such a high DPS army does better when it gets its upgrades sooner. **Rule 5: favor upgrades for slightly later mid game harassment.**

And since we don't really have any other plan than to get to mid game, then we come up with **Rule 6: Stay alive early on, and prioritize for mid game**


 ---


*The Rules*


So as a little break from all of this chatter, lets put the rules in chronologically relevant order now:

Rule 6. Stay alive early on, and prioritize for mid game

Rule 5. Favor upgrades for slightly later mid game harassment

Rule 1. I should be out there doing things instead of at home, being scared 

Rule 2. Expand a lot

Rule 3. Maximize on production and production buildings instead of later game units

Rule 4. Maximize mid game to weaken key late game engagements


Simplified here we go again:

1. Live to mid game
2. Favor upgrades for delayed harassment
3. Drop/Push 100%
4. Expand with CCs and Production Buildings


The last rule comes automatically from what I do in rule 4.


For today, I'm going to keep it simple and end there. I'm not sure how this is going to work out for me, but I feel a lot better having a set structure to go by. It may be overly simple, and stupid, but I like simple. I like the idea of a strategy that relies on advancement of skills in macro and engagements. If anything this will give me great practice in dropping and pushing, and continuously making stuff, which is my weakest point.

Hope you guys got something out of this as well.

My understanding is that mules farm at 3x the normal rate, but they expire relatively quickly too. Killing one denies your opponent any income that would have been retrieved by that one mule (which is max 300 minerals, less if its about to expire). 

Killing scvs eliminates any income from that scv from the time you kill it to the time the base is resaturated. 

Seems to me that early game, and on command centers that are not fully saturatied, you should always target SCVs, as they have to replace the probe (50 mins) and as long as their base is undersaturated, they're losing income from that probe. 

Mules should really only be targeted when the terran's base is completely saturated, and even then only if you do not expect to be able to kill several SCVs, such that you cause the base to be undersaturated for a significant amount of time.

I'm running a research study on the StarCraft 2 community, specifically the ecosystem that exists around improving in the game and how individuals rank up on ladder and use other materials (wikis, vods, coaches) to help them expand their game knowledge.  We're specifically looking at the coaching/mentoring aspect at the moment.

**Instructors and Coaching recruitment** 

I am currently looking for more active coaches and instructors who are interested in helping out in workshop // group coaching sessions every Wednesday around 5:00pm PT.  (roughly 1.5 - 2 hours).  Each session will have a theme (ranging from generic Terran strats to specific MVP Mech Build)

Coaches can also look for students to coach one on one.

We're still in a pinch to get some coaches for tomorrow's session!


**Students**

We're also looking for some active participants who are looking to improve in the game and want to attend our weekly group coaching sessions!  Players can be students one week, and coaches the other week.

**Sounds awesome, what's the catch?**

I just ask that you guys sign up on the website so we can reach out to you for interviews, surveys, and whatnot about your experiences.  This is a great way to help out research initiatives while improving in SC2!


**What's the point of this study?**

I'm currently a graduate student at UC Irvine, working in the Digital Media Learning (DML) hub studying online communities in which there is a productive ecosystem of interest based learning, content production, and peer support.  Obviously, StarCraft 2 encompasses so many of these principles. 

There are other researchers looking at other communities that span diverse demographics - such as active online fashion communities, web development, DIY makerspaces, and even fantasy wrestling.  


**Where do I sign up?**

We have a website set up at http://www.teachmestuff.net that will act as the hub for us to organize events, post up news, and get in contact with you guys.  Click RSVP now to sign up for the upcoming event, or email me at tcyoung [at] uci [dot] edu.  You can sign up for a user account as well. 

Everyone is encouraged to keep participating with the subreddit's coaching nights, and we'll look to schedule around them so there are no conflicts.

As a Bronze Terran (on EU) I macro relatively well. Most of the time I have many more SCVs than my opponent and (maybe until a big battle happens) I'm usually holding my money low, calling down Mules on time, etc.

I have a 1:1 win to loss ratio right now (sometimes it tips towards the loss side, even), but when I see replays I can see the reason I'm losing: Mass Void Rays, Banelings, fucking Mutas and cloaked Banshee harass... I don't see ""clearly not enough SCVs"" or ""your money is too high"" because I have money and I have production structures continuously making units and OCs continuously making SCVs.

Sure I slip up from time to time but my opponents are slipping up by much, much wider margins and I doubt that ""Just practice your macro and you'll be out of bronze in no time"" applies as much as everyone thinks it applies.

Am I missing something or is this one of those bullshit mantras that everyone repeats just to get rid of the usual questions easily? I find it's dismissive when people answer ""Just macro"". No... Macro won't save me from a 2 billion banshee/viking composition. 

I'm sorry if I come across a little angry... I'm just at a loss.

Since I started playing Starcraft I have had a problem where in long games my arms will lock up. I've played on and off and generally would limit my playing amount until recently. I've started to really strive toward becoming a far better player. In fact I have put aside a large amount of time towards just practicing. I began running into a problem where my arms will lock up in a game (generally mid-late game) and essentially become unable to play at all, my arms just cant move at any decent speed. This has hindered my ability to practice and play a bit and has caused me to lose several games. Now this doesn't always happen, but it happens enough and just recently I had to stop after each game until my arms felt normal again. Some games would be super long and I play it out fine but by the end and after the match was over my arms would get stiff/tingly.

Has anyone had this issue and found the problem along with how to fix it. I really want to become a high end player but I feel like this is such a large handicap. I wonder if it has to do with posture, diet, lack of heat going to limbs, etc. Anyways I've searched both google and reddit and have yet to find any help. Also, this has never happened to me in any other game I've played, curious if it has to do with the high amount of speed that the game is played at.

Edit: I'm getting some good responses. I'll try to do some more physical exercise (already do stretches) before playing and eat more fruits. I do drink enough (tons of water) so that shouldn't be big deal. In addition I'm starting to work on posture and I think that with better diet (need to add fruits mainly) I may be fine.

* How do you typically deal with someone who seems to out outclass you with their multitasking? (Turtle hard? Counter Attacks? Deathballs? Just play normally?)

* What are some things you work on to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your Actions? Also, are there things you practice to increase your overall APM?

* Do you APM spam at the beginning of the game / throughout the game? What are your reasons?

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

• Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""

• Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes). A few events ago, there were a large number of Bronze/Silver/Gold so we had to make a BS and a G.

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available at www.teamspeak.com . Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is **server.valdegames.com**

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Been playing Protoss so far but got tired of the race tbh and moved on to Terran (played three games so far with T), so this gave me a sort of fresh start. 

What I want to know is, how do I actually train? Football players don't play mindless match after mindless match hoping to get better. While games are great for getting better, I don't think hitting the ""Find Match"" and just... playing... is going to make me better.

I play the game to have fun. That said, lately the wish to get better and crush people is becoming much bigger than the ""have fun"" aspect. I'm getting a competitive feeling which I've never had in other games and I want to see this through. I've been seeing hours upon hours of Day9 and dApollo videos, player streams, etc but in games there's so much going on that I find it hard to keep everything I've learnt at the front of my head and everything fails.

So how do I train? Literally train. Should I start a game and say, ""In this game I will not stop producing SCVs. Everything else can go to hell.""? Should I try to play Very Easy AI games and practice and practice?

What do I do to really put an effort into becoming a better player, even if it hurts the enjoyment? I don't care... I will ""ladder for fun"" at the end of practice sessions if need be.

Thank you all in advance :)

**This bit is not important but it can help explain where I'm coming from...**

As a guitar player who thought myself, I went through this exact process when learning to play. At first, I picked up the guitar, looked up a couple easy songs, learnt to play them, and just played. It was fun. Relaxing. But as time went by, I started feeling the need to really get better, to be able to play all those tough songs. Suddenly, the need to get better was bigger than the need to play for fun.

So I went through online lessons and went through hours of learning scales, specific techniques, chords, finger precision exercises, etc, doing the same thing over and over. And at the end of each *practice session* I would play for fun, then. I wouldn't play for fun all the time. Most of the time was dedicated to just getting better and better. Playing for fun came afterwards.

Sometimes I would learn a song which needed me to learn a new technique and I would keep playing that song over and over until I nailed it. (I'm assuming this is the same as playing ladder games with a goal in mind, but I could be way off.)

I'm feeling that there is a way to do this in SC2... but please, do correct me if this is the wrong mindset to be in.

For those of you with some BW experience you will remember the nightmare that is the manner pylon. In broodwar it was a reasonably common practice to send your scouting probe into their mineral line and build a pylon next to the minerals to catch probes behind it so they can't mine and it also blocks the patches, so the works have to go the long way around to mine them. This was some annoying shit, because it slowed your mining quite a bit (traps probes and blockes patches) at a relatively low cost. I don't remember what the cut off was, but I think if you trapped 1 probe it was worth it (correct me if I am wrong) and if you got two or three you were doing incredibly well trading 100 minerals for much more than that, along with throwing off the opponents timings.

I thought it was dead due to smarter AI in sc2, but apparently on some maps you can still do it. In the game I saw two probes were trapped and two patches were made harder to mine by quite a bit. If there is a little cup made from the minerals that can be blocked by 1 pylon you are in manner pylon territory.

It is not common place in sc2, but I figured I would toss it out there and see if anyone had some input. The easiest way to stop it if it does become a thing is to block the pylon placement with an antimanner pylon, which is when you build a pylon in your mineral line that takes up the space that the manner pylon needs, but you move it closer to the nexus, so the probes can still mine. You can also try and be quick enough to run in the way of the enemy probe, but that can miss and you need pylons anyway.

Have you seen this before? I know I am going to try and mix it into my play when I can.

Yes I know, it sounds like that means that I'm SUPPOSED to be in bronze league, but I am determined to get the hell out of this place! 

I am almost always good on probes (2 and a half lines per base), and my army comp is usually ok, but I just keep getting rolled once I start playing silver and gold players. I think my worst matchup is against Terran. I just don't know how to start a game against them. Usually it's because I cannot tell Mech openings vs. Bio.

I recently wrote an article about the importance of macro and in the past I have written an article about staying healthy when you play games for long stretches of time. See my posts for those and more: http://www.reddit.com/user/IsomerSC/submitted/  
  
In this post, however, I want to get back to basics: how to control SC2. The first thing you see when you start the game is the ""Tutorial"" which teaches you how to move units, select workers, build things, and so on. However, once those ""n00b"" mechanics are mastered, there exist numerous others which are ESSENTIAL obstacles to overcome if you ever want to reach the upper levels of play.  
  
Here is my hierarchy (prioritized from easiest to hardest) of mechanics you should learn.  
  
1. All basic commands (right/left click, boxing, etc.)  
2. Memorize all tech trees and hotkeys
3. Find comfortable settings (mouse sens, screen drag, etc.)    
4. Mastery of at least 3 (try for 5) control groups (Ctrl+1 for units, etc.)  
5. Use of minimap (both for intel/defending harass and for sending units/rallying them)    
6. Multitask  
7. Mouse precision  
8. Engagement/micro  
9. Utilizing spam/drills to increase your APM  
10. Controlling emotions, real-life posture, and anxiety.  
  
I hope some of these concepts will give you an idea of what you need to work on.

How could I have countered?",i_like_jam,15,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wlg3r/pvp_i_lost_to_this_guy_twice_on_ladder_to_the/,"Replay: http://www.mediafire.com/?ijfqcetc75kl9tq 
DocGator (me) vs an annoying man

I'm high bronze (top 8) and have only been playing for a few weeks, though I'm not completely new to Starcraft. By some chance I played this guy twice, once yesterday and again today, and lost twice to the exact same strategy.

He starts off by building assimilators on my two gasses and both my natural gasses - at this point I realised I was playing the same guy I played before and didn't scout as I was recognising the exact same play. I built an assimilator on his gas to slow him down and pumped out zealots in case of an attack.

I think this is my first mistake - he spent minerals on 4 assimilators before he built his own, meaning he couldn't have had a big army. Perhaps I should have harassed with my zealots early on?

When I finally get a core and gas I start pumping out stalkers (and knew he was going voidrays again as he used one to destroy the assimilator I built in his base) and try to get to max cap faster than him, going for blink as well.

I think my macro was better than his, but I'm not sure I really took advantage of what I had, and I think a turning point is when I accidentally send half my army to attack my forge and then pushed (I must have been all thumbs while getting my next round of upgrades).

I wasn't sure how to push his base properly as he had blocked in, had cannons and additionally all those voidrays could take me at the ramp. I thought stalkers beat voidrays, but I couldn't beat that large a number (my micro was assuredly pretty bad).

Any help, for the next gloomy day I face off this bastard?",,False,,t5_2smn2,1342367061.0,,race-p,True,t3_wlg3r,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wlg3r/pvp_i_lost_to_this_guy_twice_on_ladder_to_the/,

I've run into this on the ladder a few times, and it's becoming more and more common. The T hardcore turtles, goes mech, but gets a half dozen ravens with Thors. The thing is, Seeker Missiles *cannot* be magic boxed, I try it multiple times in that replay and the splash is just too big. Corruptors are the obvious response, but with the ravens hovering over the Thors, anytime you ever try to attack the Ravens, your corruptors take a ton on Thor shots (crippling if you don't magic box, and if you do, you aren't going to get many raven kills).

What beats a Thor + Raven comp? Imagine I have 4 billion gas and minerals: what army can I build to kill that? Ultras get destroyed by Thors, seeker missiles take out roaches and broods. The only answer I've seen is mass Infested Terran spam (it works once in that replay, but he's got a bank and can just retreat). 

As background: the way I play mech is heavy roaches and deny expansions as often as possible while macro-ing like a boss. In a perfect game, I'll throw away a full roach army to snipe an expo, then instantly remax, and do it again. I exploit the fact that I can be mobile and trade very badly as I'm way ahead of T in economy. Once I don't see that working, I switch over to brood + infestor.

It *feels* like this is an example of a strategy where you just can't let them do it. If you let them get going and build that army, you lose. On a map like Condemned ridge, I can base trade easily -- but on Shakuras, he can split the map in half (as the replay shows) and base trading isn't really an option.

Anybody know the build or where to find it? Thanks in advance!

(I'm not talking about the 2 base roach baneling timing that he does, this is an entirely different build that I believe disregards speed in favor of getting 5 roaches out ridiculously fast off of 2 base, it hit SUPER early)

**edit** I fiddled in bnet and came up with a first stage build order, maybe you guys can add some commentary.

* 15h/16p/17g
* 1x queen, warren when pool finishes
* @116 gas start taking drones off (0 drones on gas when you have 128 gas)
* 22 overlord, save all larva possible.*
* 5 roaches when warren finishes

I don't include lings or scouting points intentionally.

Transitions?
From what I've tried, there are 3 options for transitions. The first is to get the second queen, drone up, and get a third when you can afford it (if you spread creep with first queen instead of larva inject, you can afford a hatch earlier). The second is that the 22 overlord may not be optimal, maybe instead of that, 2x extractor trick to free up supply for the fifth roach, and while you're supply blocked take a third, then get the second queen after the overlord pops. I'm pretty sure this is the greediest option.

This may be a post you may think is braggy, it's not meant for that at all, it's just meant for lowly zergs that want to have a pretty safe opening/plan for the game vs terran. It can handle marauder/helion allins, banshees and most other cheeses, but you HAVE TO scout, if you don't see it coming you will die.

Text in *italics* are notes on what to do if X happens.

**Idea/plan**

The plan is to go for heavily upgraded ling/infestor with a pretty fast hive and transition into maxed crackling/infestor/ultralisk. If he goes mech there is a little guide to that as well but not that thorough.

**Opening**

The opening is a standard 15hatch/16pool and a pretty late gas at 25 supply. The gas is fast enough to get speed before m/h allin so I don't care that much.

*NOTE, keep you second overlord over your natural to spot for bunkers, send the first to a safe spot in your opponents nat. Overlord spread is very important for ling/infestor because drops will screw you over if you don't pay attention.*

With the 15h/16p you can start two queens and two sets of lings if you execute it correctly, and when the two first queens finish you put down a creep tumor with both of them and start two new queens, after the two tumors, inject with the first two queens.

When you get your first 100 gas you start ling speed, keep your drones on gas, with your next 100 you start a lair and build the rest of your gasses and two evo chambers. Start ling upgrades ASAP.

The two extra queens I mentioned are used to either spread creep or save energy for transfuse in case of banshees or other allins. Lings are for scouting.

**What do you scout?**

If you scout 1 gas going up with your drone scout it 90% of the time means reactor helion expand. It can also be m/h allin, but you should be able to scout this with an overlord in his natural or a ling the helions missed.

*If you see no helions or very few at around 6 minute mark be prepared for banshees and build an evo chamber, 1 spore is ok but no more until you actually know he's going banshee.*

*If you see a bunch of marauders moving out from his base make a shitton of lings, and build some extra spines (or wall him out with evo chambers if you need more time), mass ling and queens should be able to mop up his force*

If you see no gas and constant SCV production with your drone it means a 1rax expand and no 2rax, counting SCVs is a very nice skill to have here.

*If he builds a bunker in your nat and you know he's going 1rax expand pull ~4drones and kill the SCV and the potential marine, even if it's no 2rax don't let the bunker finish*

*If you know he's 2raxing you must patrol a drone at the bottom of your ramp so he can't wall you in with bunkers, when marines and SCVs arrive pull 7-8 drones, use four of them to go after the marines and the rest to kill the SCVs (who should be making bunkers). Defending a good 2rax is hard, but practice is the only way if you want to hatch first.*

**What to do after lair?**

When you lair finishes you plant your infestation pit and a macro hatch (by this time you should be floating ~600minerals), start pathogen glands when inf. pit finishes. When you are saturated on 2base you can start making lings instead of drones. When pathogen glands are 30 seconds in make 2-3 infestors (your 1/1 should be finished around this time) and start 2/2 and burrow.

When your lair finishes you must make an overseer to see if he's going mech or bio (or sky-terran, lol).

Take a third at around 9:30, or after you kill his push.

**Bio,biotank**

Just continue making lings and you should get around 8 infestors before starting you hive, take a 4th whenever you feel safe, but DON'T saturate it with new drones, pull around  from each base if you evenly saturated on your first 3 bases (optimal saturation is 16 drones(two full rows) on minerals and 3 drones per gas). 

What you want to do lategame, be it blords or ultras it's your decision, if pure bio I recommend ling/infestor/ultra (incredibly important to upgrade if you go ultra). Remember to get adrenal glands for lings. If he has a lot of tanks you should go for blords. Place spire right as you start hive and a new spire when you start greater spire.
You can also use infested terrans to tank for siege tank blasts and add DPS to your army, don't overuse them though, fungal is necessary for the bio army.

**Mech**

This is very tricky to write a guide for as I don't play vs mech that often, but I never lose vs it when I see it coming (except if I fail misarably).

The most basic advice I can give vs mech is to expand and build spines there (and spores if he adds banshees), and keep injecting to remax on roach when you need to.

If you play vs mech get roach speed and burrow movement, if you get the chance to pop up right beneath his siege tanks without him noticing them on the way, do it. Remember to remake lost roaches.

Infested terrans are godlike vs a mech army, fungals are not so useful here so you can use them more freely, try not to launch ITs on top of your infestors though as they will get hit by the siege splash even if they are burrowed.

Keep him off a third/fourth base as long as you can, but don't overcommit so you die to a counterattack. IT harass to pull his army away from his other bases is also very good. Upgrading roaches is important. DO NOT EVER GET ULTRAS VS MECH! seriously, blords are 100* better in this situation.

I am a Gold league Terran player. Since I'm not that good, I only have one build per match-up that I really use. This to learn this build very well, and to be able to work on mechanics/macro while not being distracted by not knowing what to do.

Now, for laddering, this is perfectly fine. But sometimes, I play a small tournament with some friends of mine, and then I feel really held back by my lack of flexibility. When I would play against my Protoss friend, I would 3rax once, but go 1rax expand all the other games. I managed to beat him in the first round with this. In the second round however, he varied his play to include DT's, 4gate or Void Rays, and I had no answer. He was able to take initiative, expand behind the pressure and beat me easily.

Therefore, I am trying to make myself a Terran 'cook book' that includes several builds I should be able to perform well, as well as some advice on how to hold these kind of things.

Starting small, I think it should contain the following:

1. A solid macro-oriented build (per matchup). This will be the 'neutral' build

   &gt; vsT: I have a Reaper expand bio build

   &gt; vsP: I have a 1rax Marauder expand

   &gt; vsZ: I have a rax-fac expand into Mech play

2. A cheesy/techy play to force an early advantage / win

   &gt; vsX: Cloaked Banshee maybe?

   &gt; vsZ hatch first: 11/11 Rax

3. A strong one-base timing

   &gt; vsP or T: 1-1-1 push maybe?




What are some nice builds a Terran should have in his book for tournaments?

Since I've had some messages and a lot of questions, I'm going to go ahead and make an ""announcement.""

[full disclosure]

**Why haven't there been coaching sessions?**

NoseKnowsAll and I are the ones who decide when there is a session. Both of us are juniors in college. Both of us are on our CSL teams.

The combination of having a lot of work to do recently, with it being near the end of the semester, and having CSL games scheduled at times when the sessions are supposed to be held, makes it so they just don't happen.

As you know, these sessions are from our own time, and I appreciate your guys' understanding that you've had from the beginning.

**When will there be more?**

I can only assume for now that once Winter Break hits and finals are over that they will start back up. There will, however, still be CSL conflict for a while. So it's hard to say.

**What's to come?**

What I'm thinking right now is that I may try to squeeze in replay sessions from time to time. Perhaps on Wednesday and Saturday. 

However, I would really like to hear if you guys have any suggestions.

Please tell me what you'd like to see from these coaching sessions.

What is the fastest way to deselect something in a group? I forgot which game but I messed up the hotkeys and selection and I had a hard time to deselect, un rally, etc. I had buildings and units hotkeyed, so instead of moving it rallied all during attacking..ahhh chaos x.x. 

I thought Shift/Ctrl click on the menu worked, but I guess not?


Also, if you notice I mainly do 1 build (1 Rax FE to Bio) and slight variation or just forgot the order if its the first game (I usually try to warm up against AI or FilterSC Custom but, but now I just throw myself into the ladder system.

Lots of random Questions

* What should I target first against Zergs (or Protoss) when I drop?
* Any new build I should try?
* I use 1,2,3,4 hotkey for the buildings, so does 5,6 for units? I think someone said 0 for upgrades is ok?
* I guess I should start preparing/building ghosts after 20 mins or so or long Protoss game... how many should I build?

- Viper: Roach/Hydra/Viper seems to be a new viable combo at Hive. Only problem is getting to Hive, then upgrading Hydra-Speed, and filling your Vipers up with energy. Takes a long time, but is a lot of fun now that Hydra are as fast as roaches. Viper's ""Blinding Cloud"" feels a little underpowered though, costs 100 energy, is really small, and lasts like 4 seconds or so only.

- Swarmhost: No idea how to use them yet. First I built way to many I think (8-10), but they take 3 supply, are costly, and are quite useless in a head-on battle. But 3 or 4 of them for harassment don't really do much either. Anyone used them successfully yet?
- Protoss Oracle: Got harassed by 3 Oracles a few times and while it didn't seem to do much (mineral cages die really fast), I promptly run short on minerals and high on gas. Not sure how dangerous Oracle harass is, but definitely has an impact.

Gonna play a little more now, please share your thoughts, too!

1341975088.0,15,self.starcraft_strategy,wd4xx,[ZvP][Masters] Proxy hatching an FFE Protoss,,23,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wd4xx/zvpmasters_proxy_hatching_an_ffe_protoss/,"So I've stumbled into a style that's became my standard ZvP.

**The problem, and why I'm making this post**

It feels like cheese. It *feels* dirty as hell. It's like playing ZvZ with a 6 pool, winning every game, but looking back on it asking yourself, ""what am I doing? how am I getting any better?"" 

I'm looking for opinions... what am I opening myself up to with? What's the ""hard counter""? If I get the proxy hatch down, what can the best Protoss in the world do that puts me at a severe disadvantage? Cannons can be killed with 5 workers, allins are stopped by spines, stargate is stopped with mass queens (they're on 1 base, 1 base stargate is 'LOL'). I feel like not enough Protoss have seen something like this, so I'm just winning because they're a deer in headlights.

**The goal of this style:**

Hatch block to delay the protoss's natural and force a 2nd cannon. If they under-respond, you can get a queen out and creep block the natural for an almost guaranteed win. If they over-respond (some will pull like 8 probes to sit on the morphing hatch) it quickly pays for itself. There's also some value to delaying the protoss's natural until over 30 supply.

You'll be on 2 base if the Protoss adequately deals with it. You can play 2 base into roaches, ling-infestor, or muta. I prefer muta because if the Protoss is going to macro out of it, he'll need a robo for an obs which muta play is strong against. And a lot of Protoss respond with gateway timings that'll kill your third, but can't break spines and lings at your natural. Plus, it's very unlikely for Protoss to have a 3rd for awhile.

So the big picture point of this whole thing is to take back tempo and throw a wrench into Protoss. You *can* win with a creep block, but by no means is that the goal.

**The problem with other styles:**

I hate opening 3 hatch. You leave yourself wide open to a ton of stupid shit from Protoss: from 7gate allins, to warp prism immortal allins, to just a fast 3rd by P. Even double gate zealot +1 to your 3rd is just a headache to deal with... you're giving up the tempo of the game, letting P dictate how the game will be played. I'm also not a big fan of roaches in general against P, preferring lings and either mutas or infestors.

**Build Order:**

* Scout on 13
* Drone up to 15, save to 300 and your scouting drone will get to their natural around 300 minerals
* Drone to 16 then pool
* Your pool and hatch finish around the same time. Cancel the hatch if the have 2 cannons done or almost done. If only 1, keep it up and make a queen. If 1 is warping in but still early, keep the hatch (tbh, still figuring out the timing). Your first overlord helps for figuring this out.
* Macro behind this hard.
* Queen out, put the tumor behind the mineral line and hold position to block anything from killing it. If this happens, you should win every game. Get a gas if this is going to happen to get speed going, then pull off gas. 3 spines in your main to transfer to your natural to anticipate the 4 gate allin.

**Replays:**

* http://drop.sc/218472 - This is almost a perfect game, but P was bad and didn't take a 3rd. At the point where he engages, I couldn't care less about trading efficiently, as he's too far behind to win.
* http://drop.sc/218481 - P defends the proxy appropriately, building an extra cannon. We both get our naturals up just fine, and we're about even (which is the goal of the playstyle tbh)... feel free to ignore anything after ~10 minutes, this P is just bad at defending muta harass.

* http://drop.sc/218677 - See Edit.

I have dozens of these, and I'd include the ones where I lose, but so far every loss is because of me doing something incorrectly (supply block, not anticipating the 4gate quickly enough, not scouting), and not something wrong with the style. There isn't anything I've seen a Protoss do that just goes: ""well, I'm fucked now"" in response to this. 

Any thoughts? This just feels too powerful with absolutely no downside.

Oh yeah, God help the Protoss that try to Nexus-first against this build. I don't think I've ever not gotten the queen out if they were trying for Nexus first.

----------

EDIT: Ok, so I just played a game where I feel Protoss responded **almost perfectly** to this (he needlessly pulled probes). I didn't cancel the hatch, didn't get a queen out, and misread the scout (saw a lot of gateways, assumed big gateway push, first time I see the stargate is when 4 phoenix are killing my overlord) and lost all of my queens in the process and P takes a fast 3rd. Replay here: http://drop.sc/218677.

Here's the important thing: http://imgur.com/2fY6Y.jpg. This is just as his natural finishes, mine is up and has 14 drones, main is 2 over saturated, and I have 3 spines down. For everyone saying I'm behind, this picture shows otherwise. 

I go on to win, but once I have my 3rd secured, and free of the phoenix threat, I no longer feel like I'm playing from behind -- and it turns into a normal game.

Edit again: Well, if anyone thinks they have the hard counter to this, feel free to add me and try it out: Nittany (char code 272).

So lately for whatever reason, I have been playing ZvP almost exclusively on ladder. So oftentimes, the protoss tries as hard as possible to delay or outright deny both of the zerg's expansions. However, I've found this has done nothing but severely hurt them. The 200 minerals they spend to deny my expansions severely limits there defenses, making them extremely vunerable in the early game.

When I play ZvP, my early game methodology is simple. I start out 15pool, 15 hatch, and then a third hatch at 4:10. However, as is often the case with protoss, they prevent this ideal situation from happening. 
One of the key aspects of ZvP is not overreacting and producing army units before you need to. So, if a protoss places a pylon at my second, i immediately build an overlord, and try to build my first hatchery where i would normally take my third. If he places another pylon there, I smile to myself, because the entire time his worker is harassing me, I have three larva saved up, and a pool that is 90% complete. 

If he decides to not cancel either pylon, then I make 6 lings. Once they pop, I send one to kill the pylons, and the rest directly to his base. In most scenarios, the lings will arrive at his base before he is ready to deal with them. If you have enough time, focus down the cannon, and then the pylons. Continue streaming in lings, and its almost certainly gg. If you don't have enough time to kill his cannon, simply run up his ramp and start harassing his worker line. You will be able to keep him from mining for a while, at least until the first zealot or two get out.  

[Here is a replay showing the type of game I am talking about.](http://drop.sc/217310) In it, the protoss throws down two pylons, so i auto rally 6 lings to his base. Truthfully, I did not perform as well as i should have, my macro started to slip, and i lost a few unnecessary lings to a surround, but in the end I won anyways.  
**Tl;dr:**Putting down two pylons is very bad, and is often not worth the delay it creates.  



Edit- As people have been pointing out, this technique is not full proof and wont get you into their base all the time. I still feel it is something worth experimenting with, even if in some games it puts you behind. It's all about how you and the protoss react truthfully. If I see him create(or look like he is about to create) a wall off on a map like Cloud Kingdom where its easier to complete wall off, then I just immediately high tail it back to base and kill the pylons. I then stay active with the zerglings, putting them at all xel'naga towers, taking down destructible rocks, spreading them out across the protoss base, etc.",,False,,t5_2smn2,1341840201.0,,,True,t3_w906b,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/w906b/zvpwhy_throwing_down_two_pylons_at_a_zergs/,

This will be how the overall event will be run:

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

• Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""

• Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes). A few events ago, there were a large number of Bronze/Silver/Gold so we had to make a BS and a G.

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available at www.teamspeak.com . Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is **server.valdegames.com**

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Lastly, streams will be available. 

I will be running the Plat/Diamond peepmode and organizing everything. My stream can be found at: www.twitch.tv/iechozz

Playing on Antiga, I scout at 10, and then a second scout after 13 forge since I hadn't found him yet. I spot zerglings leaving his base, realise it's a 10pool and immediately decide to abandon my attempt at expanding. I throw up a cannon right near my nexus, and drop a gateway.

He drops his natural hatch at 4:40-ish, and takes his third at around 7:10. My natural expo is placed around 6:20. By around 8:50 I kill off his second wave of zerglings, and from here on in it's my 2-base ""turtle"" protoss (turtle meaning no real pushing) against his 3 (later 4) base zerg. He just overruns me, really.

Things I know I did wrong 
- Assimilator on gas that's furthest from the cannon. Should've put that down up top.
Possibly/probably didn't need the second pylon up near the ramp, but I did want the cannon up there to stop him rallying more zerglings inside my base. I realise this is a tiny issue though as it doesn't actually cause the death of any probes.

- Macro. I had a gateway (far left one) idle long enough to build a zealot (with supply/minerals in bank). So that aspect of macro (using buildings that I have) definitely needs work. This is just one example. Feel free to say ""build more gateways"" or ""tech more"" (or less?), that sort of advice is what I'm looking for.

- An overlord gets placed outside my base at ~10:30. As soon as I kill it (as I'm leaving to push), he started 14 roaches. I probably should be more active with my units, killing it earlier might have stopped him droning up as hard, or it would've meant he wouldn't see my attack coming until it's too late. Those 14 roaches stopped me taking out his third I would say. Well, that, and me leaving part of my army at home.

Questions I have:
- Did I get my gateways up in time? I feel like I was floating minerals, especially around that 6-8 minute mark. If I'd had another 5 zealots (had minerals+pylons to support them at 8:06 mark but no production buildings) then at the 8 min mark it would've been 7 zealots agains 10 zerglings, 2 cannons defending my main and warpgate 10s away. He also did not have a roach warren started at this point. I feel like that could've flipped the game in my favour heavily. I threw down gates 2+3 at 6:35, they could easily have been planted a whole minute earlier, giving me another 4 zealots. It seems like I've answered this myself, but I'm not positive on my ramblings.

- Should I have attempted to hold the low ground somehow (planting a cannon down there)? 

- Is there a ""good"" response against scouting a 10pool? Is 1base play a good response, knowing that most 10pools will expand if the 10pool itself does not win the game? Should I have double-expanded after pushing back the second wave (this obviously would require some scouting)?

My understanding of build orders, scouting, maps, unit composition, timings, Scouting, etc is pretty spot on. I read as much as I could about Zerg online through TL, starcraft_strategy and starcraft regular reddit in the last 2 months.

I am currently at work, so it will be one hour until I can upload replays. I usually just have to read up on my current problems and then I can move on after learning a new build/concept of sc2....... but I'm **STILL** having problems. The issue is I don't know what my biggest weakness is.

I started this season at Silver, (Bronze the season before). I learned that silver was really just a lot of terran spamming bio at 7 minutes, so I learned to 2 base spine crawler defend. 

Gold consisted of a lot of really clean and consistent 4 gates - I learned to Stephano 3 base and moved past gold.

Platinum so far has been a mix bag, but mostly consists of.....

1. Zerg who can hold off my usual rushes ( 6 pool, 9 pool, 13 speed, Baneling busts, spine crawler rushes). After holding off they go for long games and win (I have no problem macro vs macro games, I just can't rush vs macro like I used to)

2. Terran who 2 base and expand mid game after doing seriously punishing Medvac drops. (First few drops are held off, until they push front with tanks late game, then continue dropping like mad men) 

3. Protoss - Any alternative plays than FFE ( 1 base tech(all in's mostly)) (2-3 base 8 gate) (Zealot play these days punishes me hard) FFE is easy, it's the protoss who have creativity and know how to scout that DESTROY ME (Psionic storm destruction of my lings, immortal rape of my roaches, void and deathball against my mass infestor/roach..... )

In summary, I learned how to face specific opponents in order to raise through the ranks, and now that I'm in platinum, I face literally every kind of build imaginable against every race. It's not that it's not fun (I love the variety and challenge Plat brings me!!) and it's not that it's too hard........ I just can't cheese any more. So the real question is, can I still consistently rank up through smart cheese? (read - smart)

I am really looking to move onto dia and masters in this next season. I am looking for insider information/shared experiences on breaking the platinum barrier (Specifically as zerg, but any race could give me information as we are all breaking the same ladder). I feel as though some kind of shared experiences past platinum players may have could help me.

(I am mostly looking for people who have gone from platinum to diamond - Specifically these ladders because the metagame in each ladder seems to vary specifically and consistently based on the exact ladder ( just my personal experience)).

I will upload specific replays for each of the listed scenarios, as I feel that my play varies greatly based on my opponent. I will also upload what I consider my rank up cheese (Read: Easy wins with Cheese that happen 70% of the time).

If I just kept playing sheer amounts of games, I could be diamond (except for the fact that the ladder is closing Tuesday I hear). I am looking to do it a bit faster than brute forcing a 60% win ratio. ( I am looking to improve my cheesing, if anyone is a master of 6 pool or cheesing let me know)

I know it's a lot to read but I can feel my head hit the ceiling everytime I fail a cheese.

Inb4 stop cheesing, inb4 you suk

I just was promoted to plat when season 6 started. After a rough first few games I am starting to stabilize a bit, but of course the better I get the more I realize how bad I really am.

Here are my most recent games in each match up:

* **vZ**: http://drop.sc/113552

While feedback specific to these games is definitely helpful, what I am really looking for is advice on the next thing to work on that will help me improve the most efficiently (and the best way to practice that thing, if you know a good technique).

For example, I have been working on not getting supply blocked ever. I played with the sound off to force myself to watch the supply count better and not rely on the auditory warning and then use a supply calldown and start building depos (and then wait for the next time I get blocked to repeat the cycle). I feel that when I started getting supply blocked much less frequently, this is what let me get promo'd to plat. I still get blocked every now and then, but much more rarely; usually only when I am distracted.

I'm thinking maybe the next big thing to work on is just focusing on SCV production 100%, maybe?

I can identify the point where I lost, but I can't seem to figure out how I could have possibly won.

I feel like my Probe production was good (not great), I did neglect upgrades for some reason, but they were still better than my opponents. I had good production (in my opinion) and decent sim city (a weakness of mine). I had solid (compared to some other games) scouting.

I scout that Zerg is taking the map. I decide it's time to move once I fight back Zergs initial engagement. I take out all but two of his bases and end up with my army stuck at the top left base on Metal (the third base). Here is where I lose the game, now it is uglier then it should have been because I miss micro and only blink one Stalker against the BLords initially instead of all of them, however as far as I can see the end result is the same. I lose that army no matter what as I'm surrounded by creep and Roaches. The only thing I can think is that I would have killed more of his army.

At this point I have seriously damaged Zergs economy as mine is still pretty good, but even as I rebuild he just sends wave after wave of Roach at me and breaks me. It seems like the only thing you can do against mass Roach is to have lots of Immortals, Stalkers just don't cut it. And after you lose an army it's just too much to get that many Immortals fast enough to make a difference. What are my more successful Protoss brothers doing different from me to stop these pushes?

Hey Starcraft Strategy, I took into account all of your advice about surviving. I'm sorry to say, I completely disregarded most of it. You guys did get me thinking in the right way though, and I had a flash of brilliance last minute. 

It turns out that following my gut was the right move, because as of today I can say I lasted 20 minutes against EGMachine!

You’ll notice that toward the end of the game (around 19:20, I think) I straight up stop playing. This is because I was doing victory laps around the booth with my hands in the air. Not sure if that was BM or not.

One thing I need to say is that Machine has some of the best sportsmanship I’ve ever seen. He just laughed when I was crab dancing around him at the end of the game. Handshakes and advice before and after every game. It was a pleasure, and he deserves way more recognition as a role model in the professional scene. 

I put the breakdown of my strategy in the comments.

But that is true for all zerg units. 

My ZvT is almost exclusively ling/bling/ultra. I throw in a few infestors regularly, some more if he goes heavy banshee, and sometimes I get a spire for brood lords if he goes very tank or marauder heavy. But normally it is just heavy upgrades and melee units.

They key to using ultralisks, apart from the upgrades, is that you never should make a lot of them and never keep them close together. Many ultras in one place are their own worst enemy.

You always must have small to medium sized strike forces all over the map. That means 1-2 ultras, 4-5 banelings and 10-20 zerglings form one group.

Why does this work? Ultras do get destroyed hard by most standard terran compositions after all. But for bio to fight ultras effectively, they must kite and micro or snipe manually, and for tanks and thors to fight them effectively, they must be in well set up immobile formations and good position.

No terran can kite/micro 3 battles at once, and no terran can protect the whole map with tank lines strong enough everywhere.

You don't need to micro much yourself. You just need to attack multiple places at once, and then retreat from the battle that doesn't look advantageous, because you are outnumbered or the terran chooses to micro there.

On most maps nydus and drop play are essential for that. I prefer nydus, because it is easier to retreat and safe units (get ultras home, transfuse), but well turtling and aware terrans can prevent them quite often if you try to sneak.

In that case I do the multldrops. 3 overlords per drop, one with an ultra, one with 4 banelings and one with 8 lings. That's 12 supply per task force, and can't effectively be dealt with with any similar sized terran force.

Even if you lose one or two of those task forces in bad trades, the others will do a lot of damage.

Now, if the terran decides to go for one big push, you will have to unite your armies of course, but the fact that you have your units spread out all over the map means you can almost always set up good flanks and surrounds on the way.

It is also good against drop play, because you gather/build those strike forces at each base and have defenses right there or near.",,False,,t5_2smn2,True,,,True,t3_oaqd0,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/oaqd0/some_considerations_about_ultralisk_use_in_zvt/,

If I instead lay down that first gas when the pool is 3/4 done, I get 150 gas and can get myself a faster expansion.

Well one of lastshadow9's latest vlog (will put link at the end) got me thinking, he explained the proper way a ""timing attack"" works, essentially in my novice opinion after some thinking it equates to this, while the concept of a timing attack being an attack while you're strong and their weak is the bare basic and true. True timing attacks are created, what I mean by this is sure go 3 gate robo and hit with a 2 collosus timing attack or make marauder and hellions and hit a timing when the zerg doesn't have mutas, cool.

Now a real scary timing attack is unlocked, what made me truly grasp this concept is when I decided to go over the Sage's stream and check out his old videos 

http://www.own3d.tv/video/329806/NSH_Sage__id_168492__Archive__2011-12-10_12_09_13_-_13_01_43_

Now I'll break the game down, PvZ, P ffe's scouts a 6 pool holds well into sage's 8 dt drop, mid game composition of gateway and double robo immortals and eventual collosus.

**Actual Game** -
Literal first thing most people would think is that double robo immortal sounds stupid, I shall present le analysis. So let's start with the obvious, Sage, 8 dt drop. Well if we see a failed 6 pool into 3 bases yeah he might have lair tech but he'll have no means of scouting the tech with an overseer, cool nearly garunteed to work. Now the dt drop is what made this so interesting to me.

The dt drop does the following damage, Kills: Lair, Hydra den, Spawning Pool and some drones and lings etc. The important part here is the tech destroyed. Killing those tech structure unlocks a whole new style of play for the protoss, you see that the remaining tech structure for the zerg is the roach warren, right this means for atleast the next minute the zerg is only able to make roaches and drones, why 60 seconds? Well c'mon bro he has no spawning pool or hydra den, spawning pool takes 60 seconds EZ, next the zerg won't have Hydras for a loooooong time, sounds simple right? Let's put a value on that, he needs to rebuilds Lair,Hydra Den then build time for hydras. This unlocks about 2 minutes or whatever that the zerg won't have hydras either. 

Ok so sage instantly after doing this says, roaches... immortals! double robo goes down straight away, he realises that if the zerg was to all in him at this point it's going to be with a buncha roaches so crank dem immortals, lo and behold the roaches arrive. I see this as a ""timing attack"" he just abuses that timing to know that his composition is going to beat his opponents so hard that it's perfectly safe to take a 3rd base even at the risk of an all in. Now even though a robo bay was planted right after the robos Sage knowing he has that 2 minute timing for hydras knows that he can delay his collosus, instead he cranks out some more immortals that come out quicker and are immediatley helpful against the roach composition, then he just rolls the other guy cause he's a genius unfortunatley carrying the artosis curse. 

**Application** - Now all of this is pretty common sense but people needa realise they can put actual numbers on their timing attack if they've made one, your name puma and you just snipe another twilight council? TC build time + charge research time is your timing. You're zerg and you just killed a tech lab on a rax? Put that stim timing in your head!

So how does this help? Well, if you're trying to make a build that revolves around certain timings, you can actively try to unlock that timing, maybe you wanna do a stim push but hate collosus make a dropship see if you can kill the robo bay, yes? Push! no? Well don't push bro. etc. Maybe you just happen to do a drop and kill a greater spire in the making, brolords aint coming for another blah, vikings take blah to make cool. 

**Lastshadow vlog**: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWoTM5Y5EQ4&amp;feature=related   (can't remember if it was that one... their all pretty good anyways)

**tl,dr**: If you kill a tech structure use the power of maths to realise your timing, abuse it. Also Sage is a genius

I've started playing Terran, and went over to TL's build database and picked a cheesy build that involved a little bit of tech(3 rax stim push). I followed the guide and spent a lot of time on it, and won some games, but lost a lot more. It was only after doing some searching on the Team Liquid forums I found out that, despite not being listed in TL's 'outdated build' section, it is in fact outdated. I guess stim takes a lot longer than it used to.

I've since converted to harder to learn Macro builds. I'm making some progress every game though. I just wanted to post the builds here and make sure they don't suck before I commit to learning them.



[TvZ - Reactor Hellion Expand](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Reactor_Hellion_Expand_(vs._Zerg)
I haven't faced any Zerg in the ~10 games I've played, so no idea how good/bad I am at this one.

* 10 Supply
* 12 Rax
* 13 Refinery
* 15 Orbital Command
* 16 Marine (just one)
* 19 Factory, Reactor on rax, SCV's off gas
* 20 Command Center, SCV's back on gas
* 21 Supply Depot, Swap factory onto reactor, T-lab on the Rax
* 22 Start Hellions, **I guess Marines from the rax?**
* 32 Second refinery
* 33 Orbital command
* 34+ Transition into Siege Tech

I know I left some parts out towards the end of the build order, Supply Depots and hellions. Figured it was implied well enough. I guess the idea is, somewhere around 30 supply, to roll out with 4 hellions and poke around, while making the second CC into an orbital. My question here is when does one expand? When the OC finishes? Or even later, when Siege Tech finishes? Or should I actually be building my second CC at the natural? Any advice here would be appreciated.



[TvT - Siege Expand](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Siege_Expand)

* 10 Supply
* 12 Rax
* 13 Refinery
* 15 Orbital, Marine **How many?**
* 16 Supply
* 18 Factory
* 20 Refinery(2)
* 23 Supply
* 24 T-lab on Factory, Reactor on Rax
* 25 Siege Tank
* 28 Supply
* 29 Marines **I don't know why the BO lists these here. Is it implied this is when the Reactor will finish?**
* 31 Siege Tech

I know this build isn't the fastest expand, but the Siege Tech makes me feel comfortable. Thing is, I'm not exactly sure when I *should* be building my expansion. I say 'should' because in practice I just built it when I fucked the build up enough that I had an extra 400 minerals. Maybe after Siege Tech completes just move my marines and tanks to the natural choke, and build the Command Center in the natural? This should end up being somewhere around 6:30.

Unfortunately I got banshee rushed almost every time I used this build. Which is another problem altogether. But in theory I'd like to transition into pure mech after I get 2 bases going.



[TvP - Select's 2-rax FE](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/SeleCT_2_Rax_FE_(vs._Protoss)

* 10 Supply
* 12 Rax(1)
* 13 Refinery
* 15 OC, Marine(just one) into T-Lab
* 16 Rax(2) into Reactor
* 17 Supply
* 18 Reaper
* 19 Conc Shells
* 22 Marauder, stop marauders and make reapers.
* 24 Supply

After this it gets complicated and I get lost. It says at 27 supply to resume Marine and Marauder production. So I assume making reapers from 22 to 27 supply should leave me with enough minerals to build a Command Center. Then get Stim, then get a Starport. Then wing it.

What confuses me here is the build says to start my Reactor at 16 Supply, and has it finishing when I'm at 30 supply. That seems way too long for a reactor. Am I just a dunce? Why does it tell me to make Marines and Marauders when my reactored rax is still building? As for getting the follow up Stim and Starport, that seems like a hell of a lot off one gas geyser. I should know whether or not it works, but again I tend to screw builds up before I even get this far. And lastly, once I get my expansion up, I'll be running 2 barracks and a starport. Whats the rule of thumb on how many barracks to use off of two bases?


Overall, are any of these builds no longer viable due to metagame trends / patches? If they're all good, any advice on the particular issues I brought up? Thanks for reading.

It's also starting to have the exact problem we were worried about from the start: lots of poorly substantiated posts and a low expectation for what kind of posts are acceptable. On top of that, the amount of people requesting icons is starting too be too much for one person to handle manually. Because of this, we'll be introducing the following features sometime soon.

1) Automated league flair which syncs with rstarcraft.info. This lets everybody have an icon and makes it much easier on us. The problem is that this means people can lie about their league more easily (since we're not checking them in-game). First question to the community: Is  it OK that there will potentially be people lying about their league for the sake of having an automated league icon system with no limits?


2) Flagging posts without replays. We're thinking about implementing something like what r/iama does with confirmed/unconfirmed/fake posts, except we'll be doing it to flag posts that don't have replays but should. So, the second question is this: How should the system work? I'm thinking the best way would be to have a single icon for flagging, which would signal to the community to downvote the post if they care about keeping quality high. This appeases the people who cry that 'this is reddit, let the users decide!' while still punishing people who post bad content. (If this is the case, we'll most likely need more mods too).

EDIT: Also, if anyone knows Ruby and wants to help with the thing in part 1), give me a PM. It will speed things up quite a bit.",,False,,t5_2smn2,True,,,True,t3_jvb4j,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/jvb4j/almost1000member_update_two_upcoming_features/,

The build is for ultra fast banes and as long as you have decent control, you can litteraly end the game in the first 3 mintues.

The build:
-11 pool
-10 extractor (put 3 on gas ASAP)
-9 drone
-10 overlord
(depending on how fast your timings were and if you did the close patch mineral trick you can sneak a drone in here, the main thing is check your SP to make sure you have 15s left on the build time so that the larva will respawn by the time the pool hatches).
-12,13,14 lings
-@ 50 gas put down Banenest *DO NOT GET METABOLIC BOOST*
On multiplayer maps i send out a drone scout when my pool goes down so you can rally lings right to opponents base.
-15 drone
-16 drone
-when lings reach opponent, BNest should just be finishing, morph all lings to blings (make sure you have 150/150, cut the 16 drone if you need to)

If he went 14 pool your banes will be morphed as his lings are just hatching, in case of a 13 you might want to morph a little further away so his scouting lings dont attack you while your morphing to be safe)

-train 2 more sets of lings and rally to opponents base

Strategy from here:
-If he went for  FE, you auto win the game, not too much to discuss

-If he went pool first he will 4 to 6 lings but he wont be able to kill your banes unless you attack move into the lings and lose them for nothing.
What you want to do (or I do at least):
While my banes are morphing i split them into 3 control groups, with 2 banes in each group.  You want to send two banes to each of the mineral lines and one set that goes behind the minerals.  The usual reaction when the opponent sees the first ones is to select them all and run the opposite way which will be right into your second set :)
the ones going behind the mineral line prevent them from sneaking away that way.

*YOU ONLY WANT TO DETONATE USING X*

This will make sure you get the most out of your banes and they dont blow up on buildings, lings or a queen right as it pops out.

you should be bringing his drone count under 5 with the first 6 banes.

The second set of lings you trained should be at the base soon, i usually morph 2 of them into banes and leave 2 as lings, those lings will be for if you have a hit with only 1 bane the drones will be in the red and you can shift queue pick off the weak drones.

If you have reduced the opponents drones to under 7 I would continue pressure as youll have double the drone count and can out macro (lol at out macro with 14 drones) and wear him down.  If for whatever reason you messed up your banes or he had unreal control then i would pull off gas, drop a spine in the minerals (to defend against counters) and drone up.

I have only lost 1 game out of 15 using this strat.

The counters: Other early pool builds can counter this as they will have more lings and go for a counter attack, if you sense this, keep the second set of lings in your base and morph them into banes to defend. As this point its a micro battle to not lose those banes to single zerglings and try to come back

Their Importance and Meanings,bauski,14,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1i3ecp/zvx_counter_build_order_timings_their_importance/,"This thread is actually in response to u/lykideaus who started a thread called ""[Build Orders](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1hxd7j/build_orders/)"" where he was asking about ZvX build orders. The awesome people here at r/ss where able to answer with great resources for him to get build orders, but he had another question that was not answered. I tried to respond but reddit said it was too long. You know how verbose I get. :(

So here is my response to him, and if you are interested in ZvX maybe you can get some interesting tidbits out as well.

&gt;I realize that your build should depend on what you scout, and I want some help there to. What are popular strats I need specific builds against, and what will they look like when I run a drone through their base?

Since everyone else has answered the second question I'll answer your first!


As a Zerg, scouting is incredibly important, but of course you know that. Since they are so reactive its good to know what to scout for, but what's also important is to know what times you need to scout for things. Day9, on his show, constantly talks about timings to look out for. You can either ask other people to get these timings, but what I've found personally valuable is just playing a lot of games and getting the timings in grained in your head. Even just yesterday I just because my scouting timing was 30 seconds too late, and now I'll never forget that timing again.


**ZvZ**

First let me begin with ZvZ. The timings that matter most in ZvZ are in the beginning cause that's when a lot of big pushes can come in.

When you send in your drone in the beginning you can check for pool, gas, and how much gas is taken. All gas geyers start with the same amount of gas, so if they are mining gas, you can check against your gas to see how much they have mined. Also, if you can, stay in long enough to see if they stop taking gas at a certain point.

If they are taking gas early it means they are doing a quick something or other. It might be a zergling speed push, it might be baneling/zergling push, or even roach push. After your own pool finishes make sure to keep on scouting at their front to see what kind of unit composition they have. Also, be aware that you may want to sacrifice some lings sometimes just to see what they have. If it feels like they are hiding things from you, then you can be sure a push is coming.

Preparing for early game pushes from Zerg is pretty easy. a couple of spines will help, and banelings are always good, but having at least 2 queens at the front and 2 rows of zerglings will be the main addition that helps you out. If it's a roach push, then counter roaches with spines and queens will win you the battle.

Now depending on what kind of damage you or they dealt in the early game will correspondingly dictate what their mid game unit composition will be. But don't forget with early overlord speed, and the ability to make overseers early mid game, you won't have to worry about scouting info.

If they went heavy roaches or heavy baneling usage, then mutas are probably not something you will need to worry about. Scout just to be sure, but because of the amount of gas they used, they will most likely go into hydras. Not only do hydras cost a little less, they are also a great combination with roaches. This doesn't negate the fact, however, that later in the mid game, opponents who are ahead will usually make 6 mutas just to be a pain in the but.

If they have been harassing most of early game with zerglings and never make anything else, you can be sure as shit that they are going mutas. Be sure to rely on banelings at your back and roaches close to your front for defense, and then make sure to put down some sport crawlers. If you're able to take a 3rd before them, you've generally put yourself into a very good position. But if you do not use economy advantage quickly the muta count will get too big in just a quick 5 minutes.

Generally as of late, most zergs seem to go ultras for late game, but that just means you'll be getting them as well, so I guess you don't really have to worry about that.

Broodlords used to be very good, but now viper pulls, broodlords aren't as all powerful as they used to be against anti air units. I can't believe I'm saying this, but they could really use a buff.


**ZvT**

I'm mostly playing Terran these days so this will probably be the most helpful for you.

Terrans are kind of special in their production abilities. Unlike Zerg or Protoss with warp tech, Terrans cannot randomly go ""I want 10 units now, GO!"" and then have 10 units. They are a race that constantly has to keep on pressing that A key (marines). Since that's so the rate of production only rises with production buildings. That means, if you know what buildings they have, you are pretty much good to go. You know how much they can make, how big their pushes are going to be, and how much you need to prepare and swarm over them.

The best zergs I've played against have always had slightly more units than me at all times, and thus had more map control at all times, and thus was able to be more greedy, and thus tech faster and get to their end game composition faster. Which is exactly where you would want to be if you are playing ZvT.

Early game is yours to win or lose as a Zerg. I've seen more then 2 base 30 baneling busts now this season alone. Sometimes with roaches, sometimes just zerglings. I prefer if you didn't do this though. It's gotten to the point now, if I don't see a 3rd expansion, I actually get happy cause I know I'll win soon. What actually seems to work better is play like you're going for a half ass baneling bust and then get a 3rd a little later. The econ might be a little slow in the beginning but having the right defenses can really help you.

Cause the late early game timing is what you have to look out for. Marine widow mine drops can be deadly. Hellbat drops can also be deadly,  banshees + hellion run bys can be deadly, but one thing many people don't expect is a pack of 18 upgraded marines walking straight into their third like a bunch of hoohas. I do this all the time against early 3rds, and I think I have a guaranteed 70% chance of destroying it. That doesn't mean I win the game, but it does give me a huge advantage. Not only that, my micro is getting better, and I can imagine better players than me coming up with better splits, better chokes, pretty much taking care of your early game zergling/baneling defenses.

Thankfully all the pushes I just mentioned can be scouted quite early on. Zerlings at the front of their base will most likely help you see what the unit composition is, and I recommend getting the overlord speed after you get your baneling nest down so that you can get that production scouting. If you go pool, gas, hatch, speed, banelings, and then overlord speed, and have an overlord ready at the side of their base, you can usually figure out everything 1 minute before they want to do anything. Which is the most valuable timing to either put down spore crawlers, or a roach warren, or get queens, or all three.

If they are going hellbats, they will have a factory with a reactor, a starport with no add-ons, and an armory. In that case, you will want to make 2 more queens to hang out next to your home queens, put down 2 spore crawlers (one at each mineral line) and a roach warren to pump like 6 roaches. Why so many queens? Because they are the only anti air you have, and have enough HP to last for a while vs hellbats as your roaches come to help you out. Remember to take care of the medivacs first, and then the hellbats. If you aren't used to dealing with everything, I suggest ignoring drone movement, (cause they're more likely to bunch up when they move) and instead focus fire the medivac first, then each hell bat.

If they are going banshee hellion, then you will want 1 more queen at the front with that other creep queen, 2 spores again, and then a roach warren for the hellions. You can't take back map control, but you can have just enough roaches to take your third and go into the midgame. Banshees can't win against 1 queen and 1 spore, so as long as you save most of your workers you'll be okay.

If they are going widow mine drops with marines, you will see a factory with or without reactors, a starport with a reactor, and more than 1 rax. Spores, again are key, but instead of putting them in the mineral line this time, put them near your queen. A spine at each mineral line ain't bad either. Or instead of going static defense, you could make zerlings and banelings as defense. But do be careful, they will probably strike you at two different places like the banshee hellion attack.

So generally, if there is a starport, there will be some kind of air attack or drop, and if there is an early factory you can bet its going to either be hell bats, hellions, or mines, in the early game, and if there are a ton of rax, then it will probably be a timing push.

Mid Game is a different beast completely. I don't know how most good zergs will get through it, but at that point there are only 2 things that terran will do. Either go bio-mine with drops and parade pushes, or go mech with hellbat drops. Either way, having defensive mutas is a huge boon imo. You don't necessarily want to use them for straight up engagements, put if you have some good overlord watches on the side of the map, you can start picking off drops all the time. All you will want to do vs bio mine is try and save all your bases, while trading effectively. baneling mines are a good idea. The terran will try to expand at least twice during this section, which will feel like an infinite, but that's good. Try to do zergling run bys, (remember to send 1 before the others to catch mine hits) and bane run bys. The goal will be to keep his worker count low and possibly take down their CCs. If you get into their main, bonus, but basically you just want to break his infrastructure.

There are 2 different situations that can arise. He will either have horrible econ and macro, but a huge army, in which case you want to just pull some kind of huge army up and swarm it to death (watch out for mines dammit) or he will have a small army, and decent econ, in which case you should try to take it into the late game now.

Either way you want to get to tech 3 while you're defending in the mid game. This way you can get cracklings with 3/3 and mutas with 3/3 and banelings with 3/3 first. That will put you in the second situation I talked about which is great. Cause then you can start thinking about late game armies. With mutas taking down drops, you can start make a couple broodlords and or swarm hosts (I like broodlords for anti-mine much better), hydras, ultras, and a ton of zerglings. Use the 1 zergling at a time to scout out mines. Use an overseer and broodlord to take out said mines, then inch closer and closer with ultras at the front and hydras in the middle. At any point if things are getting too hairy somewhere else, take your bunches of zerglings and go defend. Don't worry broodlords, ultras and hydras by themselves in the middle of the map are going to be okay. Of course getting some caster units will also always help at any point in the game... if you know how to use them effectively, which is always hard in such a fast paced match up.

So that's vs bio-mine.

What about mech? The defenses against drops will still be mutas. There isn't really anything better. Another thing that'll help is the have extra queens for defense at home, and or for spreading creep constantly. Mech is very turtle like so the early you can take more bases, take more map control, and more econ, the better you will be late game, cause you don't want to go late game. Late game mech is stronger than ever. Especially with healable hellbats that can soak of zerglings, and tanks that can take down banelings, roaches and hydras, and thors that can take down mutas and ultras, it really only leaves broodlords and swarm hosts to defend, but I can guarantee they'll have a plan for that a swell.

What's bets would be to keep it mid game for ever. Keep on trading units/sniping units. It'll be hard, so if you can't snipe you will need to just do big pushes, (remember all those bases you took?) and keep his mech army low. Since it is so gas heavy, they will be far behind on upgrades from you which will help allow you to trade more effectively.

Sniping: try mutas to tanks, zerlings to thors and roaches to hellbats. If you have hydras and queens at home defending, you'll be able to do small things like that.

For mid game pushes to stomp them, you could try nydus worms, or overlord drops and then clean up with zerglings and mutas. Remember thors are the only anti air really, so if you do a push into their main, take out thors and turrets asap. Then mutas can come in and take up tanks first, and then workers, leaving hellbats standing around awkwardly.


**ZvP**

Phew this is turning into a long article. Its been ages since I've played Protoss or ZvP so I can't really say much about it, but I think, with the skills you've garnered from scouting from ZvZ and ZvT, ZvP shouldn't be all that different. Like ZvZ, Protoss can warp in units really quickly when they need to, which makes their pushes quite deadly. But just like Terran they're production is all very easy to see.

I usually don't see Protoss doing a lot of early game pushes, but 4 gate, as always, is a strong one, and especially with the mother ship core they can warp back home any time. Another good one is proxy oracles so watch out for that as well. Whatever may come though, just like the ZvT, if you get speed, than baneling nest and then the overlord you can easily scout out their tech early on. If they do go FFE though, then you'd take a third, and then I don't know what that game looks like.

Since I can't really help you with ZvP I'll just say this. There is a subreddit called r/spoilerfreestarcraft where they have videos of big tournaments that have happened recently. Go there, and watch the latest one that interests you. Find a Zerg that you enjoy watching, and then just follow his videos. You will probably be able to find some ZvP that you can follow along.

Today I wanted to talk about Build Orders.


Last week, or 2 weeks ago, I talked about [overall strategy](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1echmk/terran_thoughts_for_may_honing_your_strategy/) and went through the steps of focusing my strategy. Afterwards I started on a new post where I collected relevant videos with Innovation, and started to break down his builds. While working on this latest project, some questions and ideas popped up, and I wanted to share them with you. So with out further ado, lets start...


**What is the purpose of a build order?**


When I first started playing sc2 I would watch pro games and try and mimic build orders that I found to be cool, but mostly I found entertainment in making my own build orders that let me survive from contemporary cheeses and gave me an edge in the mid game.


By my own way, or perhaps with subtle direction from pro games, I came up with the 3 gate expand. My fast expand into full 1/1 upgrades for zerglings before 3rd was a favorite for me. For Terran, I was inspired by Puma's 1/1/1 and tried to do it every game (with much failure).


At that time it didn't matter where the builds lead, or what kind of mid game I was heading towards, or what the other player had or was making, I just straight up did whatever I wanted to and made it fit. With enough builds, and good scouting, and intuitive play, I was able to get out of most situations decently.


But watching Innovations starting builds now, I've begun to realize how I have changed as a player with my own builds, and why he does what does for his builds as well.


**Good builds are openings that follow your strategy, not the other way around.**


Watching Innovation do his TvZ, I've watched him do about 3 to 4 different builds. 1 is his favorite bread and butter, with the quick CC into rax, gas, factory, reactor and then 3rd so that he can get his bio-mine parade going at full steam. This build changes slightly from one map to another, depending on the zergling count or percieved pressure, but the build groups stay the same.


His second build is for 2 player maps where he pops out 1 reaper to start harassing and scouting, while he transitions back into hellions and then moves into a slightly slower 3rd CC, that goes into bio mine pushes.


If you watched him vs Symbol last night, then you also saw him changing his build, finally, after 3 games of cheese, and 2 losses, to account for early game pressure from a 2 base zerg, by going tanks instead of the quick 3rd base.


**But no matter what build he has done it has always ended at the same place.** A point where he feels safe enough to push out, and put on continuous pressure as he rolls through slowly, taking more bases and getting closer and closer to his opponents base.


**Each of his builds accounts for different things that are possible in the early game, and depending on map situation and scenario his build changed.** Big 4 player maps let him take a quick 3rd because nobody knows where anybody is until they are too late. smaller 3 player maps account for tricky early game ling pushes, so he gets a reaper for scouting. And if the player plays heavy early game, than econ has to be put on the back seat to prepare for pushes.


**All of this was done to follow the rules he applied for himself in the strategy phase of the game.** Innovation loves the beginning of mid game, loves getting early upgrades, loves doing effective pushes, and mixing drops in to keep the zerg pressured from 11 minutes on. His favorite thing in the whole world is to start mid game with pressure and keep it going forever.


**The purpose of build orders is to stream line the paths of the early game to maximize your strategy.**


**What is the purpose of timings**


All build orders have weaknesses. As Artosis has said, so eloquently before ""When your opponent attacks, defend. If he defends, expand. If he expands, attack."" No matter what your build order asks for, there will be some build orders others do that will work effectively against yours.


For instance, Innovations build is focused towards the 2 medivac push at around 11 minutes. He usually lacks tanks, has minimal defenses at home, and relies on hellion and reaper harassment/containment to keep the opponent busy. Going by Artosis' quote, Innovation is ""expanding"" with this build order. So what is this weak to? Straight up attack. And this is what lost Innovation 2 games in a row.


When Symbol's attacks were meak, and harass-y, Innovation was still able to get by, with delayed timings because ""expanding"" doesn't give a shit to minor harassment. But once Symbol went into ""all ins"" or stronger attacks, Innovations early game weaknesses came out. And from there, Innovation had to slowly switch up his build from ""expanding"" into ""defending"" because he knew Symbol was switching his builds from ""harassing/expanding"" into ""attacking"".


So what does this have to do with Timings? Timings are possible permutations of attacks that an opponent or you can do. How are they relevant to build orders? **Timings allow a player to fix/mask the weaknesses in his build order.**


I know this is a little confusing so let me give some examples.


Here was my [first write up](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1ckj6z/thoughts_as_a_terran_for_the_month_of_april/) when I started playing Terran last month. In it I talk about how I want to go bio mine, and I talk about a semblance of a build order that I've found to work for myself. Note that this is before I started understanding build orders at this level.


In it, I talk about getting a 2nd CC pretty early, and then getting 3 barracks and my upgrades first against Zerg. We can all understand that the CC is in ""expanding mode"" so the 3 barracks become a little confusing. If my opponent is not going for an attack, then these 3 barracks are early and useless. So why do I get them?


1. I got them because I wanted them for my over strategy of bio-mine play.
2. I wanted them because I was scared.


But then at the end I talked about how effective pushing at a random 7 minute timing with 14 marines was. Why was this working so well for me?


Going through the things we learned today now we can understand why. If we look at my build truth fully, it is a hybrid of ""expanding"" and ""defending"" but just like how ""defending"" and ""attacking"" can't be a efficient hybrid, you cannot spend resources on both without becoming inefficient.


But there is 1 hybrid that works in certain match ups. **If you are the race that trades more efficiently in battles, then ""Attacking, and expanding"" is a viable hybrid option**. 


My 7 minute push versus zerg, was working as I tried to expand, specifically because slow zerglings vs marines would always be more cost effective for me. And also because it put the Zerg in the position of ""defending/expanding"". **My random lucky timing attack was masking the weakness in my build: my expanding was slower because of my defending.**


**The second and other important point of ""timing"" is to maximize the push at the end of your build.**


All builds must end. Mid game is a tricky beast, and sometimes the way you want it to go will not be the way it ends. You may lose production, you may have to lift off, or you may lose all of your army, what then? **The longer the game goes on, the more general and useless a build order becomes.**


So the most optimal build orders will end when the generalities of events and scenarios becomes too big. **A Good build order with a strong timing will put the reign of dictated behavior in your hands, and let you control your game at your pace**.


This is what Innovation's build order does for him. At 11 minutes, when 2 medivacs comes out, he pushes out, and from there on out, it is his game. All of the build order before is to get to this point. This last attack signals the start of his never ending push. A end timing should lead you into your control, not put you in a deficit. 


**Divergence in the Build**


The last thing I want to talk about is divergence in your build order. So far I've talked about having build orders that follow your strategy, but instead I want you to think about having one build order that is maximized towards your strategy, that can be changed with slight variations depending on scouting.


Talking about Innovations 3 or 4 builds that I've seen so far, I can honestly say that most of them are just 1 build with slight variations. As I've been taking down notes for his build timings and build groups, by the time his push starts, it has always just come down to the same amount of buildings doing the exact same thing each time.


Sure, sometimes, a barracks pops out a reaper, instead of a marine, or some marauders are made, but in the end, the buildings all ""switch places"" to where they are meant to be, and by the start of his push, Innovation was back at square 1.


Knowing the weaknesses in your build, and knowing the timings that can hurt you, or help you, I personally think the best option is to focus on one build, play around with the different timings on buildings, and when they are made, to counter certain things.


For instance, if you are a player that wants to be aggressive from the beginning. Then you can try 1/1/1 into expand and then into 2 more rax with upgrades. Or you could try 3 rax expand into factory and starport for upgrades. Or you could try 2 rax, 1 factory push into an expansion and add a rax and starport with upgrades.


All of the builds I just listed have very different timing attacks that can deal with very different army compositions, but all lead to the same place at the end: a 13 minute doom drop into the main, or a 13 minute siege at their natural.


Having variations on the same build order can give you more timings that can mask more of your deficiencies. But it's always important to know what your strategy is first and know where you are going.


**Conclusion**


So the next time you are working on your own build order remember some key things to make sure that you are maximizing the efficiency of your product.


1. What is my strategy?

2. Does my build order direct me towards my strategy?

3. What are some weaknesses to my build order?

4. What timings can I use to fix/mask those weaknesses?

5. What is the end timing of my build order, and how does it transition into my strategy?

One of the most important Z mechanics is larvae inject, and I will just tell you how to do the ""backspace method"" and ""location method"" and a little bit about when to use them. (There are other methods as well, but I've never used them)

**Backspace**

This is probably the most know. Before you can do it you need to go to: Hotkeys&gt;Global&gt;Camera and change ""Base Camera"" to a fitting key (usually this is the key above TAB, for me this is |), when this is done, you must have all inject queens on the same ctrl group.

To execute it, press your queen ctrl group, then press the ""inject"" key, hold shift, while holding shift press the ""base Camera"" hotkey and click once for every time you press the ""Base Camera"" hotkey.

* | = Base Camera

* 5 = Queen ctrl group

* v = Inject

5 , v , shift (hold it down until you are done injecting all hatcheries) , | , click , | , click , etc

This method has it's drawbacks, you have to have all inject queens on the same ctrl group and they need to have enough energy, you need at least 1 queen per hatch. This may not sound like a lot, but if you screw it up your queens will derp around all over the place, if you know you made a mistake you can press S (default stop hotkey) to stop them, but you will have to start over.

I would use this in lategame scenarios, when you have 4+ hatcheries and not that much time to inject individually.

**Location**

Back to the camera tab in the hotkey menu again, you will see 8 ""Create Location"" hotkeys, rebind these to what you want (I use shift +F1, shift+F2 etc), then bind the 8 ""Jump to Location"" hotkeys to match (for this would be F1, F2, F3 etc). You don't need to go over 5, because after that this method will be troublesome (time for backspace method!), but it can be useful for jumping between bases to upgrade/defend from drop etc, I use all of them but you don't need to.

This is a more manual method of the backspace one, but you have more control over your queens, and they won't run around all over the place if you pay attention. Press your queen ctrl group, then jump to location 1, inject+click.

* F1 = Location 1

* F2 = Location 2

* F3 = Location 3

* 5 = Queen ctrl group

* v = Inject

F1 , 5 , v , click , F2 , v , click , F3 , v , click

This method is best when you are on 3base with 4hatches or less, to give you better control over your queens and not wasting that much time to inject. You could use this method lategame if you are used to using the right side of the keyboard a lot, but I wouldn't reccomend it. You still have to have all inject queens in 1 ctrl group, but you have waaay more control as it takes a little bit longer, but if you are used to it you can pull it off pretty fast (if you're on 4 hatcheries or less). Just a tip, if you are a perfectionist like me, you can select the hatchery and click on the portrait to center you screen on the hatch.

These are probably not the best methods, it's personal preference really, but I use them in dia/masters and they work nicely for me, and if you don't like to put your hatches/queens in individual ctrl groups they should be nice for you too.

Now that summer has started I've finally been putting more time into ladder. Very quickly I've noticed that I just can't seem to win versus Zergs. My TvT and TvP aren't perfect, but they are levels above my TvZ.

---

Talking to other Diamond+ Terrans such as this subreddit's own NoseKnowsAll,  I've found that it is not just myself that is starting to struggle.

I think I have narrowed it down to the fact that I can never seem to push  (at least with my current composition of marine/tank/medivac). The reason for this is because of creep.

Creep is forcing me to either severely delay my push to the point where my timing is all messed up, or I end up fighting on creep and just surrounded by lings and fungalled/baned to death.

How my games go when there is no all-in or anything else non-standard:

I do a macro build. 1rax FE into a few hellions, transitioning into siege tank medivac with upgraded marines. Upgrades usually end up being right behind the Zerg player. Depending on the map I secure my 3rd with my marines/tanks while trying to find weaknesses with drops. 

The Zerg player takes a quick 3 bases, gets upgraded lings and infestors. He turtles with spines/spores and takes 4th/5th pretty quickly since his units are so cheap on minerals. His creep is spread pretty damn far towards my base as I can't really manage to go for a big brute force attack besides one when I'm (near) max with 2/2.

The attack takes so long to cross the creep that he either has Hive tech units out, his 3/3 is done, or he catches me as I am impatiently on creep.

Basically, he turtles on creep with a super cheap army and eventually just kills me with Hive tech.

---

I don't have replays for a couple reasons:

I'd like to change my build up basically entirely. 

Many games have been with Zergs all-inning then dying to a timing push.

I haven't played against many Zergs on ladder. Playing basically 90% TvT and TvP.

---

What I'm looking for:

Any advice on completely re-looking at the matchup?

Any different builds that could possibly help slow down the creep (I've been looking into banshee/raven opening)?

What has been working for you? (I'd really prefer mid-Masters+ players for this one.)

Here is a list of all the things I could think of that you might be able to spot with an early SCV but could be harder to see with the hellions, or even impossible because it could be too late:

* Whether the zerg is doing some sort of 1 base all in

* If the zerg kept workers on gas after 100 gas mined to guess if a bling or roach bust is coming (then again, the hellion would probably be able to see the unit composition of Z by the time it arrives)

* Timings of spawning pool and extractor

* The possibilty of blocking the zerg's nat with a building

 I am only a gold level Zerg player. I don't have a replay or anything to submit but this is something I've been thing about a lot lately. I've only really gotten to do it a few times because my opponents don't normally have the best FF's in the first place and I can just micro around them, making them more of an inconvenience than anything.

One of the biggest issues it seems like Zerg players run into are good FF's from a half competent Protoss player. Ultra's are the only Massive unit we have, so its the only thing that can break them down. 

I haven't had a lot of chances to really try this out (see above statement about meh FF's), but it was gold, I was able to crush the FF's, made the sentries a lot more useless (G-shield is still good, but their DPS isnt the best) and I was able to ""hug"" his army and seemed to get a lot more value out of my roach hydra ball. 

So over all what I'm asking you guys is, is this something people are exploring, or is it something worth exploring? I know this clearly isn't the answer to mid-game BS like FFing the ramp and stopping any reinforcement from the main. But in the late game, would adding 2-4 ultras into your army for the purpose of smashing FF's be worth it?

After a few weeks experimenting with bio v mech i can say i will never go back to mech in TvT. I feel that this is part of my play style but i would also encourage other terrans to try out Bio v mech, especially if you are not a fan of tank wars. 

Now i know mech is the standard because a group of sieged up tanks will beat a group of charging infantry no question. I have found though that it is a lot easier then you think to catch players off guard with their tanks then you might think. If you let a mech player get to your base and siege you probably lose. However, with good map vision and being ready with your bio force you can easily crush tank/hellion or tank/marine pushes in the early-mid game. And all those vikings they made for air control? ya nice waste of minerals and gas. 

I have found the simplest trick to take your meching opponent by surprise is to leave a marine outside his base, one at the watch towers, and then maybe one by your base. this way you know where he is at all times and with equal army strength you will beat his army with a stim and him not being sieged up. 

Other benefits to this bio style i have found is earlier expansion, and easier drop defense. I usually like to open 2 rax expand just like in a TvP. Since blue flame is still very popular in tvt most terrans will not have much for defense. Especially against a few rauders with shells. If they do not build a bunker at their ramp you can usually get them to pull scvs and get a few easy kills. Once the expansion is building add a 3rd rax, and when the natural is mining add 2 more for a total of 5. While moving about the map with initial pressure it is important to constantly make units and RALLY THEM to or near your mineral line bc guess what a hellion drop or banshee is probably on the way. This will easily shut down and sort of harass, gaining you a advantage along with your earlier expansion. Following up your initial attack is the next step usually with stim and combat shields and sometimes a +1 depending. After a hellion drop or banshee fails the next logical step is to get tanks, siege up and defend a natural. This is the best time to attack. Bc they invested in drops they will at best have 2 tanks by the time your stim push comes and maybe one bunker while your army should be vastly superior. Do not be warded off by 1 tank and a bunker stim in a snipe both easily, its a lot of fun to do so. 

From this point on i usually like to secure a third, add a factory and starport and just play out the rest of the game. At this point i do like to get a few tanks mainly for defense and map control if needed but a heavy bio force can always get it done if you catch their army out of position.

If they do not go for a drop and go right for marine tanks you will still win if you fight them before sieged up, you must always know where your army is at. Also if they open up bio then its a bio on bio fight with the advantage just going to the better player. 

This kind of TvT is interesting to get used to but if this sounds like your play style of being active, aggressive, and making strong timing pushes give bio a try. Bio is very effective against mech if used at the right place and time. feel free to add any criticisms or suggestions to this thread :)

Hello my friends, I had a very high winrate on EU as Master in WoL and I was thinking again a lot about PvP in HotS. That's why I wanted to discuss my conclusions with you. 

You're welcome to add your opinion or correct me if analysed something wrong or forget something to mention especially i am especially unsure about the openings part. Furthermore I am a human and its late;) and sry if my english is not the best i am not a native speaker :)

Notice: This ignores all 4 Player maps so i defently will scout my opponent in time. Tournament Maps like star Station are with force positioning anyway (and I guess it will get on ladder later on too)


Until now I noticed that they are 3-4 Types openings evolving to metagame: First of all there is the very commen 3 stalker opening into tech. Mostly combined with DT or oracles. The negative side of this build is that it need to do some dmg, even if its more save vs aggresion. And thanks to this a little bit better for low league Player.
(I dont feel like i need to save the BO here, since its very commen and you will find if you google for it)


The next one is a one (some people do it with  2, but i dont like this) Gate Expension. This is something i find out while watching the Coaching PvP with Root.Minigun.  Here the plan for this expansion

1 Gate Expo 

15/15 Gas (2,2 very soon 3,3)

zealot, sentry(1xchrono) sentry, MC, Expand

around 16/3/3 do a small probe cut and get 2 gates then Robo)

hallu scout react

The advantage is, that thanks to the robo you are pretty save vs any kind of DT Expansions, which are pretty common these days and you get your Expansion faster then everyone else. Vs a Stargate opener you have to get 3 stalkers in your mineralline so you can fight an oracle. Otherwhise you get too much eco dmg. I 
--&gt; NO PROBE SCOUT! Just vs Proxys!


The last Build Order i want to give you is the 1 Gate Tech, combined with an Oracle Play. I think you can do this vs DTs too, but i like Oracles much more since you get saver vs DT Builds. and you are less scrwed vs Robo builds xD

15/15 Gas

3 in both gas

1 zealot

1 sentry + chrono 

At 27 - Stargate

1 sentry WITHOUT chrono

add 2 gates (maybe small probe cut)

ca 36 MC + Expo

--&gt; NO WORKER SCOUT!

In any case your MC should go to scout for proxy Stargates near your base, since they could be a pretty great threat!



As next i want reroll the following game from the very late game to the lategame and mid game. ( In this discurs i won't speak so much about kollosi/archon vs kollosi archon and gateway tech vs gateway tech, because that should be known by wol...otherwhise day9 made a good about Gateway/robo vs Gateway/robo somedays ago)

Our very ending composition is about a hell of Tempests, some HT with storm, 1-2 Oracles and maybe some Archons and Voidrays. Let's be honest. Tempests are the new kollosi you can play as good as you want, you can dominate your opponent as much as you want. In the end there is no way to win very late game fights without Tempests.

You are on 4-5 bases, got a lot of gateways, all your bases are covered with cannons so DT and Zealot attacks are not really a choice to do, at least not without risking your main army because its way to small to deal with the opponents one. And the MC give your opponent allways the possibility to kill an expension and TP then back to his base where you desperatly try to snipe 2-3 Techbuildings.

I am very sry, but i have no clue to win or at least outmicro this lategame composition then with just tempest +storm... maybe mix up some hallus if he really commit to a fight. But otherwhise i have no clue. If anyone have a clue how to win in this situation let me know



But well let's take a step back how does this escalated this quickly? We opened up kinda safely, may tryed but were not sucessful to kill our opponent (or our opponent us). So now we have to think what to do next.

What I love about PvP is the mid and late game. Because it's all about scouting what is your opponent is doing and reacting to it because: In generell its Robo/Kollosi &gt; blink/charge/Archon/HT &gt; Phoenix, VR,Oracle&gt; Robo/Kollosi. I recommend that you send a scout all 1,5 - 2 ingame minutes so you can watch the tech switches of your opponent.
Sadly i can't talk about all possible transitions from openings into midgame. But since the most should be kinda known from WoL i just want to speak about one. I also recommend to build a Robotics at a certain point of the game because the opponent can allways switch to DTs to kill your ground army (+ Cannons for your Bases)


Fighting vs stargate. You are on 2 base. And no matter what you Follow up were you should try to get a third as fast as possible and safe as necessary!Minigun suggested an Expension around 11.30.  You will need it to stronger your eco for a second tech path. Because in all cases you will need a second techpath sooner or later. (It could be even necessary to play with all 3 tech pathes in late game: Kollosi, VR, HT/Archon). But well now to the question how to beat a stargate player. If you allready build a stargate the answer is easy: Build 1 Stargate a base. Means: 1 Base= 1 Stargate, 2 Base = 2 Stargates, 3 base at least 3 Stargates. The next question is about the upgrades: I think you should start to get +1 Attack on 2 base, and when u get your third also went for the fleet beacon to get the range and follow it up by + 2 and a second Core for defence upgrades. Another departure is to go for +1+1 and while go for the defence Upgrade to build the Fleet Beacon.

1 Phoenix does not kill another faster but because it attacks two times the attack upgrade is stronger then the defensive one.

BUT! The most important is the range upgrade. If you have it and the oponent doesn't, he is going to die if you micro your phoenixes even just a bit. He can't escape because his units are as fast as yours. So be sure to hit a timing with a decent amount of phoenix and allways to chronoboost your Starports + Upgrades. Also scout his tech, so you can react to a Carrier or Tempest Transition (with Tempest by yourself + killing some Worker) Just to mention it : Phoenixes crushes VRs Last trick: use hallu phoenixes fights to get a small advantage
So much about you going to stargate by yourself. But what are you going to do when you didn't went to stargate? You die, because you didn't choose the imba tech!


Just kidding^


If you didn't went for stargate you have to sit a bit more defensivly. You should add a twilight for high templar tech. To be honest, i doubt that blink stalker are a good answer vs stargate. Versus few Phoenix they are good when combined with a MC. But vs bigger amounts you need Feedback + Stalker (+ VERY GOOD SCOUTING!). Versus void rays stalker really sucks. When fighting VR you do NEED storm. There is just no way that you can beat Void Rays with Stalker. But even if many player never thought so( i was one of them) storm is very good vs them. Archons are okay, but storm is the better answer especially if the numbers are getting higher.
If you see HT coming by your opponent you should add Kollosi but in most times he will transition sooner or later into Tempest. And if you dont kill him now when the number is low u get problems with killing them just with stalker, HT,archon or a void ray transition. In that case you need a better economy (by harassing + good trades + a lot of expensions) to transition into Tempest yourself.

This coaching session will be similar to the last coaching session. People will pair up in the beginning and play a game and once everyone is done, we go through the replays one by one stating what someone could do differently the next time. Then we use the new take over replay feature to see how the players changed their play with their new knowledge!

Having a microphone is not a requirement but highly recommended! It's hard to have a conversation when one person is talking and the other person is typing.

For example the 3rd base with the rock tower. Should I destroy my enemy's rock tower to delay his expansion or should I wait until he's set up and make it fall on and damage his base? What factors will decide which 3rd base I should take? They're both rather hard to secure.

Since the map is roughly the shape of an X, should I put an emphasis on air units? From what I can tell, air units are much more mobile than a ground army when attacking an opponent in an adjacent (not cross spawn) base.

Korhal also looks a lot like a 2v2 map since your natural expansion is pretty much a freebie, sharing the same ramp and all. Am I correct in always assuming my opponent will take his natural early on? Is there any viable strategy that involves 1 base? Should I prepare for anything abnormal if my foe doesn't expand?

In bronze League I see a lot of TvP stalker spam. In early game situations would it be better to simply have more Marauders or more marines does it change depending on whether or not I have stim? According to the game's help section Marauders are supposed to counter stalker spam, but it just seems like the spam rips them apart either way.

2. When expanding should the first thing you produce be the orbital comm upgrade assuming it's in a safe low risk place? Is the mule drop worth more than the amount of SCVs you can produce during the upgrade time?

3. I see hellions being used a lot against zerg. What makes them so appealing? Assuming I start off with dual rax 1 lab one reactor and expansion, what makes them more appealing then going air harass by banshees+ cloak/medevac.

4. Relatively which faction expands the fastest and which the slowest?

5. In regards to Medevac drops, is it better to drop say only marines against zerg and 4 marines and 2 Marauders against protoss?

6. I see that Medevacs are sometimes used simply as support healers during a battle. How much of a combat multiplier is this? Can Two Medvacs heal one unit? 

7. Just how situational are Reapers? I often forgo them in favor of either banshees or air drops. Apart from that, it seems like most of the ladder maps are made so that Reaper base entry is a relatively slow and unprotected path. Even some of the first expansions make them seem really useless. 

8. What is the point of getting the concussive shells? Is it simply to help chase and kiting?

9. How do you judge when to stim? When on offense do we stim before engagement to run in? Should we selective stim in certain situations. Ex early stalker spam, stim only Marauders.

10. I hear from people that Battle Cruisers are underpowered, is this true? I find them useful in some of my games. Although looking back at those games, i had vast reserves of resources.

11. What is a good way to set and control tempo?

12. Against Mutalisk spam, what are some good alternatives to the Thor?  It seems rather odd that this cheap spam able unit requires such an expensive and late game counter.

13. Can somebody explain the practical uses for the Raven? Apart from being a detector I don't find very much use for this unit. How do the two turrets work? Does the seeker rocket help against Mutalisk spams? Does the energy Regen make constant use of it's abilities viable? What exactly does the point defense drone help out with? How many missiles does the point defense drone deal with?

My current APM ranged from 85 - 100 on average.

The most obvious keyboard tip everybody knows is to use hotkeys instead of clicking. Common sense. 

Here's something I just learned today that may be common sense to everyone else:

I was watching pros warm up their hands and took close notice of their hand placement. A glaring problem in my play is that I often look down at my keyboard a LOT. I realized all pros don't have freakishly huge hands; they just don't use wrist rests on their keyboards which allows them to hit all the essential keys easily.

Now that I've taken my wrist rest off, I can finally understand how they are able to reach all the important keys very fast.

Is there a big hand placement/keyboard control guide on TL that I have missed? Do you guys have more tips to help those who can think faster than they can find the keys?

EDIT: Although ""play more games"" can be a valid answer, I'm specifically looking for the same kind of tips as removing the wrist rest, hand positioning, etc. I've played close to 3,000 games and will continue to play, ""play more"" isn't constructive feedback.

I am the creator of the University of Reddit course ""Official Starcraft II Strategy"" and I started my show a couple of weeks ago which focuses on becoming a better Starcraft II player. The mods have been nice enough to let me use /r/starcraft_strategy  as a platform for discussion for my class. Hopefully this will give us more content to actually analyze rather than simple ""Help!"" posts followed a generic comment answer.

Link to the class: http://ureddit.com/class/48233/official-starcraft-ii-strategy

**What is this all about?**

The Official Starcraft II Strategy is going to be something like a mini Day[9] daily from one of our coaches. Each class can be anywhere from 10 minutes to and hour long session that focuses on a specific aspect of the game. Our first lecture was on scouting as protoss in the early game shown here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MUJPpWhKik&amp;feature=plcp

Although I admit I have a lot to work on, we will continue becoming a more professional show (webcam coming soon!) and we will be trying to put out the best content possible.

**What makes you different from all the other players putting out tutorials?**

We have sources like Day[9], dapollo VODs, and plenty of other resources to learn from, however I haven't seen any sort of collaboration for collective learning. My goal is to have a solid roster of very good players/coaches that will be able to teach specific lessons (e.g how to scout, hotkey setups, and timings). With a collective mindset, we can take a look at different perspectives from other players.

**How often are you putting out content?**

As of right now we are doing Tuesday and Thursday nights (we don't have a regular starting time so please register for the class to receive the updates). I will be posting the announcements and VODs on this subreddit so we can all discuss it.

**Who is teaching?**

This is actually a big issue right now and a big reason why I would love help from this subreddit. Initially we had myself (1300+ master last season), Gemini (1400+ master last season), col.sasquatch, and formal member of Quantic gaming decemvre. Sasquatch had to leave because of his full time contract with complexity and decemvre left willingly. We would love to have high master/GM level players to come help out. Please email me at senseigamingceo@gmail.com if you are interested.

**Where can I watch?**
Each time a coach has a lesson, I will be sending mass PM's to everyone who is signed up to the class with information on who is providing the class, what time they are streaming, and where they can find the stream. You can always find the VODs in order on the site and also check this subreddit for the posted thread.

TL;DR: Casual webshow Tuesday and Thursdays that will be posted on this subreddit to provide helpful tips on becoming a better Starcraft II player from the University of Reddit.

If anyone has any questions, please comment and I will try to get to them ASAP. Thanks!

Today I just wanted to write my thoughts on what are some of the best ""easy compositions"" you can use to start winning a lot of games in the lower leagues. These compositions don't require fancy micro or lots of multitask and they are versatile, working in pretty much all situations in each matchup. Just use these until you win, no need to tech up more because you can win A-moving with any of these compositions alone if you focus on macroing. Here you go:  
  
ZvX: Roach Ling (+Infestor optional)  
PvX: Stalker Colossus OR Chargelot Archon  
TvX: Marine Marauder Medivac  
    
I think these compositions are robust enough that you can pretty much make them blindly and be okay in 90-95% of games. Sometimes you will die if your opponent does something wacky like Sky Terran, but in general the compositions are robust.  
  
Note: The purpose of these is not to win per se, it's so we can focus on macro'ing up without worrying about composition. Once we get into Plat+, then we will focus more on scouting and tweaking our build.

Now I'm definitely not the greatest player ever, but I feel pretty confident in the ZvZ and ZvT match ups. However, I lose consistently to protoss players. No matter what they do, or how many variants I face I always seem to just fall flat on my face. 

I tend to play Stephano style 3 base roaches. From here I either defend (and lose) his 2 base all-in. If not, I try and stop or delay his third base for as long as possible. If not, i go into macro mode, grabbing my fourth, and either going infestors or mutas, depending on the map. If he attacks before I have brood lords, then i just lose to the death ball. If he attacks after I have broodlords, I just lose to an archon toilet. Nothing seems to work out in my favor, and I'm starting to get pretty disillusioned in this matchup. 

Here are a bunch of replays I have, most of which are versus some of my protoss friends who are much better than me, as well as a few ladder matches. Drop.sc is still down for what seems to be permanent, so I had to find an alternate website to upload them. Hopefully they work!

To reiterate the above, at points ZvZ has been my best match-up, but the match-up, win or lose, is always terrible.

Some background: I made it to masters as Zerg, but then almost entirely stopped playing on my main account because over 50% of my matchups were ZvZ (this is not hyperbole, I use SC2Gears, these are the actual numbers -- I made a post after 86 games).

I am closing in on just entirely switching races to Terran, but would like to see if there's any way around this -- and I repeat, this has nothing to do with, ""oh, you just suck"".  I'm not getting into win percentages, it's irrelevant.

-- From here it's a description of why I dislike the match-up.  If you don't care, or just want to create an argument, feel free to skip it --

You can state how it's about nuance and scouting as much as you like, but there's simply a matter of chance related to larvae.  Scenario: You scout drone counts with two overlords, and see the unit count with a ling in front.  You see a modest drone count, and a small army.

This was all while a bunch of eggs were open.  If all of those eggs are drones, and you spend on a bunch of army, you're way behind if you don't attack right then.  If he spent it on army, and you attack, you lose.  If he spent it on army to attack and you spent it on drones, you lose.

This is simplified, but the general crux of my problem.  Yes, scouting helps, but you're constantly betting against what he's doing, with limited justification.

-----------
###What is it?

[/r/starcraftbuilds](/r/starcraftbuilds) is a subreddit experiment that will be run by the community. The idea is that the subreddit will act as a place to learn, discuss, practice, or experiment with build orders relevant to the current metagame of starcraft II. If you are someone who's looked up builds on Team Liquids [Liquipedia](http://wiki.teamliquid.net) in the past, I'm sure you've found that the wiki can occasionally be hopelessly out of date. The goal of this subreddit is to create an up to date archive of build orders, and allowing discussion or refinement of the builds as the metagame shifts. 

'But how do you make a archive with Reddit? Wouldn't builds disappear after a few days?' you might ask. If you have ever been to [/r/music](/r/music) or the [SFW porn network](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn) you will have seen the pull down menus they got going on over there. This subreddit uses the same feature, but with links to build order posts, allowing easy navigation to the build order of your choosing. (I suggest you check it out)



###How will it work?

The community will be essential to running this subreddit. Posting new builds, replays, reactions to different openings, etc, will fall (for the most part) into the hands of the community. I've tried to throw together as many quality builds as possible before introducing this subreddit. You will find its packed with SC2 audio builds along with a few select builds from Liquipedia as those are the two best sources for build orders (that I know of). I'm sure once we get a more active community and a proper group of knowledgeable moderators(As the sole mod, I'm neither a group nor knowledgeable) the quality and quantity of the the builds on this subreddit will increase. 

Notice a build missing from the subreddit? make a post! Got a replay of yourself performing a build? feel free to post it. Got a problem with holding a 1 rax FE vs 4gate? Feel free to ask questions or open a discussion. 


###We need moderators

If the idea of this subreddit interests you, and you would be willing to help moderate the subreddit, send me a PM. Having a wide knowledge of SC2 strategy, and prior subreddit moderating experience would be preferred.

Toss player btw


I read everywhere that first thing any player needs to learn is to macro, and to macro as fast as you can. Honestly my APM is shit and it isn't going to get better, I play for fun mostly. But at least I want to be able to build as fast as a pro, which is something apparently anyone can do, even players with low APM.


I have been hotkeying nexus, gateways, and then robotics. I am building zelot, stalker, sentry, immortal, and obs. Trying to start simple, the build I am practicing is 3 gateways, then robotics, and if I go long enough I get whatever the building is for colossus. I build forge and make 2 cannons on the ramp as well. I don't bother w/ warpgate because for me it is much easier to just hit 2 and then spam hotkey  for what I want to build. Like I said, my APM sucks. I wont be doing a 4gate against anyone, I really am not that good or coordinated. 


My problem has been defending the expansion. I get to the point where I need to expand and so I do. I build about 2 more cannons and move my forces in front of the expand. That is normally when the comp comes and destroys me with a superior force. I suck at micro, all I know how to do is activate sentry and leave them as far back as possible while covering my stuff. I know how to block ramp for early attacks, but I have gotten good enough so that the comp never does an early attack anymore.


I noticed when I expand I start getting a lot of minerals that I honestly am not really using. So, what is a good high tier unit that uses a lot of minerals I can dump them into?


Also, how do you know which upgrades to give to ground units? Should I just always research upgrades right away, or only when I expand?

What sort of dumb builds do you guys have that seem to work wonders on the ladder but just make no sense?

For me recently I've been real frustrated with PvZ. I decided to just go balls out aggression at all points of the game and its been working. It goes like this:

* Do a 1 gate zealot pressure, either off 1 base or FFE. Save chrono and chrono out like 4 zealots to force units, spines, ect. (Seen kiwi do this a lot)

* Transition into double stargate play with void rays. (Makes you safe to any roach counter attack and they likely aren't ready for it in a pub)

* Transition into double robo colossi because they probably went hydra.

It's a stupid build with so much tech off of 2 base. Logic dictates that it *shouldn't* work but it's dumb enough that it does. I usually stay fairly low early on for gateway counter (like 4-5) which lets me get these big tech units earlier. 

So what about you guys. What dumb ass builds do you have that seem to work on the ladder? 

**edit:** I've done this more tonight.. still have won *every single* PvZ I've done so far with it. This last game I ended up sniping off his tech with the voids so he wasn't able to get out enough corruptors in time to deal with the colossi.

1324763420.0,14,self.starcraft_strategy,npidm,TvZ Reapers into +1 Double Marine Drop,NoseKnowsAll,16,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/npidm/tvz_reapers_into_1_double_marine_drop/,"Fed up with hellion openers in TvZ, I watched some streams the other day until I saw one of the Korean Terrans do this build.  It's great for taking map control, punishing zerg if they get too greedy, and it allows you to safely retreat if zerg has been massing too many units.  Feel free to ask questions or discuss!

**Overview**

Basically, you are performing a 1rax reaper FE with 3 reapers into a marine medivac army with upgrades.  Because you get 2 reactors with this build, your marine production really ramps up and perfectly transitions into the mid and late game.

**Build**

Default opener - 10 depot, 12 rax, 13 gas, 15 orbital.

Then depending on whether or not a worker is still in my base I will get the first marine out or insta-techlab.

Once techlab finishes start producing reapers one at a time (eventually stopping with the third).  

With first 400 mins start second CC and with first 100 gas start stim (both around when 1st reaper pops).

Follow up with 2 more barracks which will both get reactors as soon as they finish and factory with next 100 gas.  I usually throw down second gas geyser when barracks are halfway down but I'm still messing with the timings.

Next is Engibay for +1 attack, starport+reactor on factory and combat shields.

Swap off the factory and starport, produce 2 medivacs and drop him instantly with 16 marines.

**Goals**

With your reapers you are not trying to do much damage or even any damage at all.  Instead, you are trying to draw zerg's attention away from the fact that you've 1rax FE'd so that he won't allin you by microing reapers in and out of his base.  If you lose your reapers too fast by being super aggro with them then a simple mass ling counter attack will kill you.  Keep the reapers alive and zerg is not free to allin you.  You are very weak at home while you have the reapers abroad - do not lose them if you can.

With the marine medivac drop, you are there to do actual damage.  Almost always if the zerg is unprepared for it, you will do some serious damage if not win the game outright.  You should drop out of sight of an overlord and then stim your way into the main mineral line so that you can kill off buildings and workers.  You'll be surprised how well +1 marines with stim/combat shields/medivacs do vs just lings.  Only pull away if there are too many blings.  Abuse the marines range and get into the mineral lines where lings are not effective at all. Focus fire the spawning pool and/or banelings nest so that you can stop reinforcements and then have free reign over the entire zerg base.

**Transitions**

Obviously this transitions well into marine tank medivac and not at all well into mech.  My suggestion is that during the drop you should throw down in this order: a 3rd CC, a second factory to start double tank production, a second engi-bay+armory to continue upgrades, and then possibly 2 or 3 more barracks to truly become a 3 base terran player.  Mutas are coming soon so prepare a solid defense with your reinforcement marines and turrets where necessary.

**Replays**

In this first game I perform a solid drop but have a very weak transition because I did not quite know what buildings and such I should be building.

http://starcrafting.com/replays/sc2replay-download.php?key=84SZV3 

In this second game, he does one base roaches but then when I scout it does not build any of them and expos as normal.  Thus, instead of making the usual reapers I built a marauder and slowed the build down.  However, because I slowed the build down and he didn't build any roaches the drop actually gets to his base after his first couple of mutas pop, but luckily they go straight to my base and avoid my drop.  Another solid drop but because he has faster banelings, I lose a lot because I fail at focus fire.  In terms of transitions everything looked pretty good except I forgot my upgrades and he killed the scv building the second factory.  Eventually, I get to earn sweet sweet zerg ""imba marine"" tears.

(TvZ),blackangel153,12,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1edwkc/what_could_i_have_done_tvz/,"I like going mech vs zerg, because I hate dealing with muta harass, which is pretty much inevitable and it also gives me an opportunity to harass with BF hellions, and then turn them to ling killers in my main army.  I think I did ok, except I didn't harass at all really, except one hellion run by.  Not really a big concern though, as he didn't either.  Don't ask me why I didn't harass, I have no idea.  Anyways, by the time I got maxed the first time, he was going ultras and I knew it, and figured thors were the answer.  Throughout the majority of the game, I had better macro, better upgrades, more units, better units (until he got the mass ultra), and units that countered his hard (hellbats for lings, thors for muta and ultra) and he still won anyway.  [This](http://drop.sc/334921) is the replay in question.

My thoughts:

* I already know I don't have godly macro (only goldy).
* I am aware that I didn't harass really, but to be fair he didn't either.  I didn't do terribly with my income, though it was behind his for maybe 2/3 of it because I didn't realize for quite a while how ridiculously oversaturated my natural was.  To be fair, according to the graph, he was only slightly ahead of me during that time.
* I probably should have made widow mines.  During the game, for some reason, it didn't occur to me to make those instead of *that* many hellbats.
* I definitely could have won with an early bio attack.  Like, without any doubt.  However, I always go mech vs zerg, and I don't like attacking early with mech because I consider it an investment that needs to be paid off and usually will just bite me in the ass if I attack with like three hellbats and a tank.  Maybe I wasn't thinking properly, but I still don't think I could have mounted an early attack with the mech.
* I probably could have done some damage shortly after one of the only offensive engagements I won.  I only had two ish thors and nothing else really.  I didn't like the idea of him rushing my guys with lings and raping them, so I thought it wasn't worth it to go in.  He didn't have lings, and had just started making some.  Considering the information I had, I don't really think that was a bad move.
* I don't think any of the above problems caused me to lose, because the top two misakes, my opponent was also making (minus oversaturated), the bottom two I still don't think was a particularly poor decision considering the intel I had (remember, not dropping, so not very much intel, though I did scan from time to time so I knew his army composition), and with the widow mines I don't think it would have been enough to turn the tide of the game.

1368416555.0,12,self.starcraft_strategy,1e83e4,All About Micro,IsomerSC,25,13,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1e83e4/all_about_micro/,"Hey Troops,  
  
If you've ever seen sick forcefields, phoenix kiting mutalisks, awesome marine splits, and any unit control that dazzles you and makes you get nerd chills, you've been watching ""micro."" Micro-management is a concept that refers to a player's control of their individual units on the battlefield, as opposed to macro-management which refers to the management of your economy (making workers, supply depots, making buildings, making units, etc.)  
  
While I am writing here to emphasize the value of good micro, I want to emphasize the following: micro is the LAST thing you want to prioritize in a match. Experienced players will recognize the truth of this, but for those who doubt me, think about the ""value"" of different actions in Starcraft. What's better: stutter-stepping your marines perfectly to save 3 or hitting your production cycle to produce 10 marines?  
  
Thus, before you focus on micro, remember that it should NOT be prioritized over macro. Macro-management simply has a much better pay-off for players with lower actions per minute. This is often why beginners SC2 guides just recommend you focus on macroing up mass marines or mass roaches and just attack-moving into your opponent's base. Macro is simply far more powerful than micro, assuming you can only do one well at a time.  
  
Let's say you have a crazy APM, probably Diamond-Masters level, and you can keep your money low while your bases are fully saturated and you are not queueing any units (Terrans, don't queue). Now, you can use micro!  
  
What are the different kinds of micro you can utilize? There are plenty of them, and again it's all about prioritization.  
  
1. Battle Micro. This is the most important kind of micro, which happens in big battles. You need to stim your units, cast your spells, target-fire, spread your units out, pull weakened ones back, bring in that flank, etc. This kind of micro is CRUCIAL as there are so many units that can die in a fight, if you are able to battle effectively, you will have a MASSIVE advantage in mid-late game.  
2. Stutter-Step. Think about marines. When they're micro'd, you see them move-shoot-move-shoot. That's stutter-step. Pretty much all units can do it. Sometimes you see it with a zealot against slow lings in early-game PvZ, for instance, or you see it with tempests or broodlords. It's also common in other games like DOTA and LoL, so needless to say: stutter-step is actually quite effective for improving the efficiency of your units.  
3. Target-fire. This is pretty simple. Let's say I am playing a blink stalker vs blink stalker fight. If my opponent simply A-moves at me and I tell my stalkers all to shoot the same stalker, then shift-click that targeting throughout his stalker line, I will win that fight. That's because I am reducing the amount of stalkers he has faster than he is reducing my count. This works with ranged units quite well, make sure you use it to target down colossus with vikings, broodlords, etc.  
4. Pull-back micro. Very simple. If something is dying, you pull it back. This is a ""move"" command and thus the attack priority changes to a different unit and your weakened unit can keep fighting without dying.  
5. Splitting. This is most important against splash damage units, like bio vs. banelings or storm or colossus, splitting off banes or lings to rush in for a timing against terran or zerg, etc. Splitting is quite hard and I wouldn't recommend practicing it too much as it takes a lot of time to learn well.  
6. Spell-casting. This is pretty much just landing your spells properly. This is actually really important, spells are skill-dependent and thus it doesn't matter how many infestors you macro'd out if you can't land a fungal. I'd recommend going into a custom game like Unit Tester and just practicing out your spells. Especially forcefield - this is SO valuable, it's really worthwhile to practice it.  
  
  
There are some other kinds of micro, like off the top of my head: burrow-unburrow, kiting (similar to stutter step), stacking air units (mutalisks), shift-blinking stalkers, etc. Don't worry too much about the more obscure types of micro if you're just starting off. These are just things to practice and think about. Keep on macroing hard and work these things in when you can!

I (z) open FE and scout. If we see early pressure I open banes and slings, if they play more macro, I skip speed and go straight into +1 missile with roaches. He (p) opens with double oracle harass and builds 3 gates at the 6 minute mark when he leaves with his two oracles. 

Because of the level of play, he usually gets some pretty solid harassment done. This often prompts a counter-attack which we easily defend with spines, roaches (+1 is usually done already) and some sentries/zealots at my natural. 

After we hold the counter, we usually push for the win with swarm hosts, roaches, stalkers and a couple voidrays. 

We've taken down diamond 2s teams with this strat and unless they go for a crazy early all-in rush that we somehow don't scout, we win! Any ideas of how this will start to be broken at the higher levels of play?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. The early rush is an obvious weakness that we will need to address.

**Derelict**

 Looks pretty normal. The middle isn't that exciting, and those sides could be kind of fun to play, but kind of like that ice map that people don't play anymore (the one that's not neo planet), the sides  won't be  used that much except for the rare few in our league. Probably by mid diamond you will see later mid game harassment using those chokes, but hopefully by then you'll have some supply depots over there.


What's really interesting is that, that map is clearly divided into two sides. So lets say you're starting in the 8 o clock position. You take your natural. And then you take your third as that one up in the 10. 10 doesn't have an entrance except from your side. You can still take 6 for your 4th and then the ramp up for your 5th, It's all on your side. Will it ever get that long? Probably not, but there really aren't that many attack paths. Just that choke where your natural and 3rd are, and your 5th base ramp approach. One is right in the middle, and the other you have to attack into. This might be the most cross mappiest thing ever.


*Terran wise*

I'm still going to do my 8 minute marine timing that I always do, if I can, and then since the 3rd on either side is very hard to defend, I'm going to start dropping a lot more on this map. Hopefully that gives me a chance to take my own expansions and take a good forced position on their 5th just past their rocks. If I can get that position, I'll be able to either break their 3rd or deny their 4th. Then do a nice drop into their main.



**Klontas**

 I was really confused about how you take your 4th on that map without budging out to the middle. The spawn distances are really close, so I'm thinking that for a while you'll want to just do some kind of 8 minute heavy pressure build. At least that's how I'm going to start. Since every other noob will play that way. I'm also guessing a lot of cheese will happen because of that early 8 minute pressure timing. Then people are going to bitch and moan, but hopefully these days there are enough big maps that seeing some little maps is acceptable. Later in the season I think people will figure out a 2 base 12 minute timing, that tricks people to be guarding their front from that small ass bridge, and then push down from the blocked rocks pass on the fourth as well as from the front.


After a while people are going to be able to take early naturals on that map, maybe even from the beginning even with the cheese and early pushes but we'll see, and then guarding the 3rd is going to become the problem as good players will push in from the mid bottom but also from that rocked off 4th. If you can take your 4th, which no good player should allow them to, then you'll be able to position on that middle tip from your 4th and take the rest of your bases. So I think the biggest battles will be early game, mid game, and the late mid game for that position on the tip of the fourth. From that point whoever takes theirs with least amount of losses will win.


*Terran wise*

This would be such a good map for reapers. Reapers everywhere. Dropping in that main from the 3rd area, dropping down from the 4th into the natural, If you were micro/macro juggle-y enough you could win games by just confusing the opponent into submissions. Protoss should make more cannons on this one just in case. Too bad I don't use reapers though. I'll probably try for a 1 base 3 rax timing push actually and see how that fairs. People are gonng start easily defending that bridge quickly but against zerg that might be really easy to push. From there I will either win or be behind, and so I'll go into expand and start doing parade pushes, which allows me to take my 3rd easily and then my fourth is also easily defended. It will be really bad against drops though, so I'll probably want to do a parade push and a drop at the same time sort of deal.


I'm most likely not going to do the 1 base 3 rax thing, mostly cause I'm just trying to keep my builds incredibly boring and simple, so I'll just probably still try to pull a 2 base 8 minute marine push and see how that works out. Tons of games later I'll decide if it is or isn't efficient.


TvT games on this map are going to be epic.


**Zerus Prime**

If Protoss doesn't win every game on this map I will have to laugh. Reapers can be easily denied since there are only two places to come in from (front and then the back), air attack distances are just as far as ground, three bases are easily defendable, and because of the clear middle, the idea of sneaking bases is really hard. Once protoss gets a 3 base death ball, they should push out into the middle, take control of the two towers, and just starve the other guy to death. I think this is a great map for protoss to try practicing air while being very defended. I say this because you can only have horizontal or cross spawn on this map, and have you looked at the vertical gaps? That is perfect for doing some air harass, especially since there are 3 vulnerable sides/bases to attack.


*Terran wise*

Defending against protoss 3 gate expand will be hard on this map. I can almost die to it normally now, even with one nice place to defend, so the idea of having that tricky rocks will make my bunker placements really important. If I scout 3 gate, or anything else sketchy, I obviously defend. If I don't I'll do my 8 minute marine push at the front and then if the force looks too big and well prepared, I'll drop back and then destroy their rocks and then do another front push and keep them occupied for a second or two. Then I'll probably go into parade mode... maybe, I don't know. With so much easily defend-able chokes for protoss for Protoss and the openess in the middle for zerg, I'm gonna need more experience playing it before I make any more plans.


Hope this helps you guys...

PvZ a Zealot push at ~ 8min

PvZ if I scout Mutas coming I'll usually push to force money/larvae expenditure.

Here is the third installment of my ZvX metagame analyses. I hope you liked the ZvP guide and ZvT guides, you can find them here: [ZvP](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/10ibwk/zvp_my_thoughts_on_the_current_metagame/)  
[ZvT](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/10geau/zvt_thoughts_on_the_current_metagame/)  
  
**ZvZ Early Game**  
In the early game, the first decision you must make is which build order to open with. The hierarchy of builds, with regards to aggression, can be thought of this way: Early Pools (6-10) &lt; Gas-Pool &lt; Pool-Hatch &lt; Hatch-Pool. If you are one level in the hierarchy above your opponent, you will be in good shape (i.e. 14g14p will pwn a 10p or 6p). If you are 2 or 3 below your opponent, you should be able to do damage (6pool pwns hatch first or even pool-hatch).  
  
For Ladder, I would recommend pool-hatch as your standard opener. It is really not that far behind hatch first, economically speaking, and it saves you the worry of instant losses to cheese. Cheese will not be easy to hold, but it will be a lot more do-able.  
  
In the pros, however, you see a huge diversity of openings as people try to meta-game and mind-game their opponents. Think about how often Leenock, Violet, DRG, and Nestea use early pools - it's really frequent to keep their opponents honest.  
  
Assuming you have 2 base up and you were not cheesed, you need to establish if your opponent is 1 base or 2 base. If he is 1 base, he could be doing ling-baneling allins, roach baneling, roach ling, or pure roach. You need to ascertain which build he is doing by running a ling in. If he is blocking off the ramp and doesn't have an expand, sacrifice an overlord in to see what he's doing. Here are the easiest responses to the 1 base allins:  
  
Ling Bane: Spine, 2 Queens at natural, ling/bane of your own  
Roach Ling: 2-3 spines, 2 queens, ling/bane  
Roach Bane: 3-4 spines, 2 queens, lings (don't lose them on banes)  
Roaches: 4 spines, Queens, lings.  
  
You will have to micro to hold these, but in general the sooner you identify and stop droning, the better you will hold these cheesy plays, so make sure you make 2 lings when your pool pops to scout him out.  
  
If he's two base, there are a number of allins that you will see. Ling flood, roach ling, and ling-bane are all common for a 2 base non-droning player. You can identify he is doing a 2 base allin by using a speedling to see his drone count at natural (lots of drones = few units and vice versa), sacrifice an overlord, poke with an overlord to see what's popping from the eggs, and so forth.  
  
The responses to the 2 base allins are basically the same as the 1 base allins, but keep in mind if your opponent's speed is way faster than yours, it is often a good idea to go banelings first. I would never ever recommend playing without a baneling nest in ZvZ, sure Nestea does it but he is a God of ZvZ and we are not.  
  
If you do not see him allining, you need to drone HARD. Droning hard is the best way to get a lead going into the midgame, so work on doing that safely so you don't die to allins. It's all about scouting in early game ZvZ, because at home all you need to do is 4sd4sd4sd and injects until you see aggression.  
  
Ling bane micro: I will just say here that this can determine how hard you are allowed to drone. If you get good hits, you will force him to make more lings; if he gets good hits, you can't drone in case he allins you. Practice this in Unit Testers as I have never found a ling-bane micro map, though I wish they had one like Marine Split Challenge.  
  
**ZvZ Mid-Game**  
The midgame is, IMO, the point when players are going for their third and Lair. For these reasons, you need to have an overlord near the main and near the 3rd, so you can make an overseer and scout his Lair tech as well as seeing his 3rd base timing.  
  
I would recommend going roaches as you go Lair, starting the +1 upgrade before you start making roaches, and take the third with ling/bane/roach shortly after your Lair begins. You should go for all this stuff once you have DRONED your 2 bases. If you go for this stuff too early, your economy will suck and you will lose the roach battle to someone who teched more prudently.  
  
Once your 3rd/Lairs are building, the main questions you must ask yourself are:  
-Is he taking a 3rd? If not, is he going to allin my third?  
-Does he have lair yet? If so, is he going muta or infestor or roach-hydra?  
  
The best ways to answer these two questions are with the overlord at his third. You can pop it in towards his natural and look at the gasses. If he has all 4 gasses, click on them to make sure they have been mined. If he has taken a bunch of gas, prepare yourself for muta by creep spreading between your bases. Once you hit Lair, you MUST overseer into his base to identify his tech.  
  
A note on gasses: for roach-infestor play, which is what I'm using most games, you will want 1 before Lair then 3 when your Lair is building. You don't really need the fourth until your Lair is done. You can take the 5th/6th gasses at your third once it finishes and saturate those to get more infestors, or send drones to mine minerals to get more roaches (I would recommend infestor count, personally).  
  
If muta is coming down, make a couple extra queens and get a spore at each base, maybe 2 at the most vulnerable. Your infestor timing is crucial to deny further muta harass, but there's no way you will have the infestors out in time for the initial harass.  
  
If he is also playing roach-infestor, you have a lot of room to drone your third because infestors take a while to get up. Once you start making infestors, throw down a hydra den and start adding in maybe 10-15 hydras to your max army, which will make it significantly stronger.  
  
Make sure you get creep spread, overlord spread, and some overseers around if you know he is doing roach infestor or roach hydra, just because burrow can mess up your life, plus those other things will help you a lot in getting good army positioning.  
  
IMO, ZvZ has a pretty long midgame just because going for Hive is pretty weak, I would much rather max out on roach-hydra-infestor with 2-2 and try to kill him if he's going Hive than go Hive myself. BL and Ultra are really good ZvZ, but they are so slow to get to and slow to use, it's just unsafe to go there unless you have a lead or you play really defensively, which would allow your opponent to take a 4th with no issue.  
  
A note about ling-infestor-ultra: This style is really hard to use properly. You need to counter attack constantly, get a lot of spines, tech really fast, and then survive pre-ultra timings which are very scary. I would not recommend this style, I think it's just slightly inferior to roach-infestor(+hydra).  
  
**Late-Game ZvZ**  
This is largely a tactical time. There are many things going on here, such as:  
-Drops. Lots of infestor drops, hydra drops, etc.  
-Nyduses in the back of the main, pulling the entire army back  
-Ultras from ling-festor style are BEASTLY strong if you can survive long enough to get them.  
-Broodlords are very strong indeed, but roach based armies are really fast and infestors can take on broodlords anyway, so I don't like BL that much.  
-Mass spines is really good, just like in ZvP, because they will save your life in a base trade or if your opponent is dumb enough to engage your army with your spines.  
-Going Hive just for 3-3 is something I have seen, and is definitely effective if you see it's getting stale-mateish because both players have so many infestors they can totally wreck an attacker with fungals.  
-Undefended expansions SHOULD be harassed, hatcheries are really really weak against upgraded units, so definitely see if you can snipe one with a subset of your army. 10 roaches is worth a hatchery when you can re-max instantly, so go for that multi-pronged harass.

This is Symbols opening into late game against the typical Mech Terran which has very strong anti ground capabilities. It utilizes the early advantage of roach drops ontop of the army with only thor (or few vikings) as anti air. The +2 carapace reduces the splash of thors anti air severely and makes closing the distance to the mech army much easier or dropping against turrets easier. The Air Flyer upgrades synergizes well with the transition to broodlord/infestor as a the ultimate counter to the lategame mechechanical army.

Goal
This is a defensive build with strong upgrade timings aimed at pressuring a turtling mech player with Roach pressure and drops. It doesn't rely on doing economic damage, but can significantly delay the 200/200 mech push.

The build gets speed not just because of scouting, but to counter be able to able to deal with various all ins in the middle stage. You don't need to produce zerglings at all. This is a must have upgrades early in the game when you can't be 100% sure the opponent is going mech.

You want to saturate at least 3  bases of minerals along with 6-10 Gas to afford the lategame hive tech units (From my understand 4 bases at least until the lategame transition is done is preferable).

Here is the video I got the basis of the build from. I feel like it might have been offset by the proxy banshee being discovered.

I guess my questions are:

Here are a few things I noticed myself. I haven't played for a while so my interpretation might be outdated. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

* pool timing -&gt; build own pool 1 to 3 drones later (depending on map.)
* pull drones off gas at 100 -&gt; speedling + expand
* pool before gas -&gt; fast expand or roaches
* lot of spines early game -&gt; likely: roaches / mutas, not likely: banelings


ZvP

* first pylon at expand -&gt; fast expand
* nexus before forge -&gt; weak to 1 base all-ins
* lot of sentries on 2 bases -&gt; weak against mutas
* templar archive on 2 bases -&gt; expect HT / archons
* 7gates soon after 2 bases -&gt; 7gate all-in
* twilight timing? -&gt; [blink timing](http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/x3zfx/protoss_2_blink_attack/c5iyxy6) 
* gateway, warpgate then chronos on warpgate -&gt; 4gate
* warps a pylon close to your base -&gt; timing push incoming.
* gas timing on expand -&gt; [gives a lot of info on follow-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/wtw7k/zv_scouting_info/c5gmfng)


ZvT

* gas soon after orbital -&gt; no early agression -&gt; possible hellions or banshee harass
* no gas by 15 ~ 16 supply -&gt; 2rax or fast expand
* overlord scouting at 5:00 gives away everything terran is up to.
* drops somewhere in your base -&gt; terran is trying to distract you from something.

So I got up to Diamond about 9 months ago. I've hardly played over the last few months and I'm fancying getting back into it. My main race is protoss, and honestly i'd say i'm gold-ish league skill wise now despite still being plat so I do expect to lose a lot of games at first. The thing that always annoyed me before and even the couple of games I've played now is how do you deal with the fact that most players aren't going to do logical things? Take for example one of the games I played last night.

So it's ZvT (I played Z on and off before, admittedly not the best idea). I go into this game expecting to lose since my mechanics are rustier than the RMS Titanic but still aiming to play my best. So I get a decent drone scout, see 2 early-ish gases and think ""ok, so this is obviously going to be some kind of factory or starport play"". No problem, I was going to go 2 gate robo anyway. Right enough I scout with my first zergling set and I can see a factory as part of the wall with nothing building from it. So at this point I'm pretty much positive it's going to be banshees, cloaked or otherwise. Bang down an evo chamber and a few more spore crawlers than necessary while expanding. Sorted.

Couple of minutes later 2 medivacs full of hellions and marines drop into my base.

Now I'm positive I could post the replay and you guys would find a hundred different things I did wrong, I'm aware of that. The problem is obviously my approach to the game. So many games I lose because I'll suddenly see something and think ""wtf is that"", far too late to put up any kind of defence against it.

It's not super important how you open, although I think Phoenix builds transition to this the easiest.  The important thing is to get to 2 base vs 2 base fairly safely and evenly.  Once on 2 base, no matter the opening, anyone looking to play for the lategame (i.e. not a 2-base all-in) is GOING to switch into mass Colossus.  This is just a fact of modern PvP.  And because of that, they're going to have to sit in their base and assume you're also going Colossus.  The standard logic is that Colossi own any ground army except MORE Colossi, and that attacking is usually disadvantageous because concaves are so very important in mass Colossus battles.  So PvP becomes super turtly passive Colossus fests.  We capitalize on that by going mass Carriers instead, and by hiding them until critical mass.  Think of it like PvT in Brood War.  There's no really great answer to Carriers for Protoss.  All Protoss players know how crappy out anti-air is.  Stalkers are just bad units.  Void rays are made of glass.  Phoenixes don't do good damage against Carriers.  If you get out 10 or more, with +3 air weapons (+3 attack for carriers is absolutely critical) you're pretty much going to win the game.  And the best PvP ground army is going to be ground-to-ground focused, with little anti-air, because of how good zealots are and how bad stalkers are.

Ok, so what's the build?  As soon as I'm on 2 base and scout that my opponent is playing for the late game (upgrading, teching to colossus, generally not all-inning) I throw down a fleet beacon and get to 2 stargates.  I start making carriers, researching graviton catapult, and researching +air attack upgrades.  It's very important to have an observer by this point (to be safe from surprise DTs and to scout, you ought to have one anyway) and make certain there is no observer in your own base so he won't see your carriers.  The more money the other guy commits to expensive ground units like Colossi and Immortals and Archons, the further ahead you're going to be when you engage.

When you feel it's safe (based on scouting), take your 3rd.  You need the extra gas.  Once on 3 bases, I get charge and high templar archons.  The only real way you'll lose is to a LOT of blink stalkers, and chargelot-archon, even in somewhat small numbers, will roll over stalkers.  Seriously, stalkers are bad :P  No need to sacrifice Carrier count for ground army, but you want your ground army to supplement your Carriers to the maximum.

Once at a critical mass of Carriers (usually 10+) and +3 air attack, you can feel confident enough to move out with them.  Abuse cliffs as much as humanly possible!  Target fire and micro back hurt Carriers as well.  Microing them is important to maximize their effectiveness.  Obviously, prioritize killing anti-air before anything else.

The opponent is going to do a few things in response (hopefully he can't respond too early if you hide them well).  He might mass blink stalkers.  Charge zealots are good to deal with these, but good Carrier micro can work too.  As long as you have observers with your army to kill his observers, you'll be able to abuse cliffs and map architecture against stalkers as well.  The most trouble I've had with blink stalkers has been when the opponent evaded my army and tried to base trade constantly.  Charge zealots, and splitting carriers can work to defend this, but it's a weakness of such a slow army.

He might go void ray.  Include a lot of stalkers in your ground army, and micro the carriers well, and you won't have much of a problem.  Reactive void rays are almost certainly going to be low in number (again, hiding Carriers is important!) as well as unupgraded.

He might also go phoenix.  Again, include stalkers (or archons) in your ground army, but just target fire and micro the carriers.  Phoenixes do very little damage against them.

I'll edit this with some replays in a little while.  If you're sick of making colossus, try something a little more interesting!

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

• Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""

• Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes). A couple events ago, there were a large number of Bronze/Silver/Gold so we had to make a BS and a G.

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available at www.teamspeak.com . Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is **server.valdegames.com**

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Lastly, streams will be available. 

I will be running the Plat/Diamond peepmode and organizing everything. My stream can be found at: www.twitch.tv/iechozz

It allows me to defend mutas, and possibly deny a third for the Zerg player via void ray harass. 

I expect the meta game to shift in the not too distant future as more people start doing this. I'm only a crappy high gold player, but stargate has never been a weak build versus Zerg, and the phoenix upgrade really increases its usefulness by allowing you to hard counter muta harass if necessary. 

I fully expect Zerg players to start going 2 base hydras as a counter to this. I haven't really seen it yet, but I know its coming. How soon can a Zerg player get that out? I generally build only 1 stargate and start teching to colossus. I'm just curious about how worried I have to be about a 2 base hydra push. 

Quick story on an expected ""Meta game shift"" : 

Yesterday I played a game where my opponent went mutas after seeing my stargate. I fought off his initial pack, and put down a fleet beacon where he could see it. Because I put the beacon down, I was SURE he was going to stop building mutas. I was so sure that I went with the carrier upgrade into carriers rather than getting the new phoenix upgrade. I figured that he'd be crazy to keep building mutas after seeing the fleet beacon and several phoenix on the map. Unfortunately, the guy didn't understand how hard that upgrade counters mutas, and he went mass muta and destroyed me because I had skipped the upgrade. I mentioned this after he beat me, and he actually asked me to play another game with him so he could see how well phoenix counters mutas... I don't think he'll be going mutas anymore once a fleet beacon is on the map.

However the more I watch higher level play and read/listen to people discuss the game, it seems more like the difficulty with Zerg is that the player has to have their decision making ability tested more often than the other races. For example, I see a lot of Protoss players just turtle up until they have amassed a 'death ball' with the typical few colossi + bunch of zealots/stalkers/sentries and just roll over whatever is out, while the Zerg player has to scout a lot ahead of time and build a more specialized counter to survive. 



As a bronze player, I am constantly reminded that this is NOT the level of gameplay that I need to be concerned with yet and that I just need to macro, macro, macro better.

1326695240.0,11,self.starcraft_strategy,oizuz,[General] [PvP] A taboo topic - late game PvP,DUCKVILLELOL,14,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/oizuz/general_pvp_a_taboo_topic_late_game_pvp/,"Obviously a bit of a weird topic given the fact that in higher leagues PvP rarely(see: once a year) gets to a ""standard"" late game. But for those who may have also been watching LiquidHero's stream this past 50 minutes as of writing this - the games have gone on over +25 minutes, which is essentially late for PvP.

Hero has a very traditional ""high level"" style of PvP, attempting some 3 or 4gate contain/pressure at the start, then hitting up the more standard 3/4gate blink with robo. On his game against FXOTear he transitioned into immo/blinkstalk with some sentries for good measure - and continued on that for a little while. Behind the fog of war Tear was hitting up Colossus - which as of late have been copping a lot of crap as they are ""far inferior"" to blink stalkers. 

I can accept to some degree that what used to be an old standard of a ""2colossus push"" is pretty much dead - with the advent of mass blink stalkers, phoenix openings and even from time to time a prism-immortal play will crush this. But in my experience, later game Colossus ""war of the worlds"" is still a huge force to be reckoned with.

Back to my reason for posting this whole thing - Hero seems to make an extremely late switch to Colo/dt/Archon high level techs, and in the game against Tear - not counting the back-and-forth eco harass - I think that cost him the game. Tear came out with Archon/blinkstalk/Colo, a big colobattle ensued (Hero had about 6 to Tear's 8 possibly 9) and rolled him.

*As I'm writing this Hero is in another PvP, this time on Entombed, and we're at the 13 minute mark and he's pushing with gateway units again... deflected... anyway*

With all that in mind, here are a few questions:

* What do you think is the best ""late-game"" combo for PvP?
* When looking at timings - what do you think is the best time to make a switch to this ""late game deathball"" based on the success/failure of your early/mid game blinkstalker/2base-push (et al)
* How much does the opening you use effect this? Eg, if you go for a Phoenix opening, would you tend to keep nix in the army for the whole game as an immortal/colo deterrent?
* Is there a way to shift to late-game styles that doesn't get used *purely* because of how short PvP normally is? (Eg, ""3 base carrier is amazing in PvP but it never gets there!"")

It is my current understanding that Chargelot/Archon is one of the more effective late game strats - the ""dream combo"" being either Archon/Void or Colo/Void, but GLHF with that happening.

*Hero just lost :( Gateway+Immortal army pushing into his nat, bad positioning and no thermal lance on his 2 cols costing him it looks like*

In order to try to focus on mechanics, I stick with a single build vs T and Z, and go for a different one vs. P.


It seems whenever I play a Zerg, I make my timing push and it gets slaughtered by ling/bling. I transition from bio to marine/tank and put up turrets in decent locations for the coming mutas. Howver, from that point on I die with every push. Lings and blings surround me once I'm out of my base. But I figure I might be able to solve that by working on positioning or something. The biggest problem is when I encounter a pack of 30-50 mutas. When it's 10 or so, my turrets scare them away, but in the massive pack, they simply destroy the turret and proceed to essentially one-shot everything in my base.

So my question is, assuming I can't prevent them from getting such a large pack of mutas, is there any way to kill them? I don't want to start focusing on harassment until I get more comfortable with my basic strategy, so I don't think there's much I can do to prevent it.

I'm very excited about the possibilities and want to start a discussion on this style. For those unaware, here's the gameplan: after we're safe against 4-gate (you scout 2nd gas, or opponent's 4-gate fails, or you have a build that's safe against 4-gate, whatever), we make a robo first to be safe against blink and DT timings. Then you build a twilight council pretty fast as a followup.

This lets you win against blink stalkers (immortals + blink vs pure blink), harass more effectively using an observer for high ground blinks, scout better (2 observers minimum!), go DTs against a build that has no detection, and go chargelot+archon+immortal if you spot colossus builds.

It's incredibly versatile and safe, and skips all the annoying ""build order rock paper scissors"" that PvP used to be. I'm really getting excited for PvP again!

I think the first I saw of this was Huk. I don't know how much it's caught on yet - Korea's metagame seems to have gone back to 4-gating for whatever reason.

TvP is not my strongest suite. In fact, it is my weakest suite. TvZ, I'm sure everyone will agree, is a cake walk at equal levels. T just has a lot of great ways to harass and put pressure on the Zerg right now, and if Z tries to put on the pressure, even better, as T can defend even more cost effectively.

TvT, like any mirror match up, is a gamble sometimes, but I've found a starting a build that borders on cheese, but works too well not to use. Hint: 3 rax, all reapers into an expand and hellbats.

TvP has, however, still been a hard one. I understand that drops a key point of the match up, so I'm trying to get that into play more, but I like safe openings, so getting my medivacs out takes some time.

Usually I would go 1 rax, expand, into 3 rax total, and then factory and starport with all the tech lab upgrades, and go into either a drop harass as I try to maximize my army, or just a straight up scv/bio push. The bio push is a stupid idea, because concave is so necessary in a TvP engagement.

While doing all of that, I would focus on making marines to keep my gas necessities and supplies low. Not only that, I was under the impression, DPS wise, marines &gt; marauders. I would only begin making marauders right around the time the starport would start building.

But just now I was watching demuslim, and his early game and mid game seems to be very heavy on the marauder front. His engagements seemed to work better that way as well, against a mid game protoss ball.

Have I been making the mistake of not making enough marauders? If so, should I, instead of trying to get to medivacs ASAP, try and to maximize on marauders for my mid game interactions and harassment?

Any tips would be appreciated. Thank you.

1366862366.0,10,self.starcraft_strategy,1d286e,Brief analysis on why I think mass stalker still works as an effective counter to mass void ray,Veshan,15,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1d286e/brief_analysis_on_why_i_think_mass_stalker_still/,"One of the more frequent complaints about PvP in HOTS is that void rays seem to counter stalkers now. When the void rays have Prismatic Alignment on, they beat stalkers by almost every metric:

Supply for supply (2-to-1 ratio): Voids dominate
Mineral for mineral (2-to-1 ratio): Voids dominate
Resource for resource (16-to-7 ratio): Voids win

But there's one metric we haven't considered yet:
Gas for gas (3-to-1 ratio): Stalkers dominate

A single base provides with 16 probes on minerals and 6 on gas gives ~672 minerals and ~215 gas per game minute, a ratio of 3 minerals to 1 gas. That means that on even bases (without even completely saturating your minerals), you can use ALL of your gas on stalkers and not run out of minerals. This means that you in fact can match the void rays gas-for-gas in stalkers on the same number of bases. 

This does leave your opponent with an abundance of minerals, which for units pretty much means zealots. Blink stalkers stalkers beat zealots outright, and I'd argue that with proper micro even give charglots a run for their money (especially with a few token sentrys).

In addition, if you are careful with positioning, blink stalkers will potentially have the ability to avoid the void ray's Prismatic Alignment. If this happens at any time during the game, the gas-for-gas stalkers will not just win but completely annihilate void rays.

Blink stalker play also puts you on the tech track for the other counter to void rays, High Templar. (Archons work supply-for-supply, but not gas-for-gas, so are viable very late game). Also I'd argue it gives you map control if you've built enough stalkers to punish any movements out.

Overall, I'd say that twilight builds are a vary viable response to mass air from the protoss (which against your ground units basically means mass voids). You can't win with them alone at max army size, but at that point you should have HT anyway.

Comments/rebuttals welcome.

EDIT:

I did a followup that sadly suggests that charglot+stalker+HT is fragile against charglot+void. It's surprisingly easy to lose: the stalkers just get eaten too quickly by voids. It ends up relying on very good storm micro and luck. However, I realized something else that is awesome: sentries actually fair surprisingly well in a straight up fight against voids. They lose, but it's closer than I would have thought. This is because voids do *6* damage to non-armored targets. Guardian shield drops their damage by 33%: its as painful to void rays against non-armored units as it is to marines. And archons are wonderfully non-armored. 

Charglot+archon+sentry+HT DESTROYS charglot+void, even gas-for-gas and definitely by every other metric. They can't even target-fire the sentries for the most part because even the sentries are hard for voids to kill for the same reason, and you can make them a surprisingly large percentage of your composition.",,False,,t5_2smn2,1366880456.0,,,True,t3_1d286e,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/1d286e/brief_analysis_on_why_i_think_mass_stalker_still/,

This is an instructional + discussion on play style as well as builds that focus on responding to a Fast Forge Expand Toss or Fast Gate Expand Toss that goes air to harass the Zerg while massing up a 2 base 6 gate, or 2 base 4 gate immortal army.

First let me explain some of the choices Zerg has to responding to such a situation:

1 base all in with zergling roach bust, or zergling baneling bust (this is prior to even air)

2 base quick infestors or hyrdas + lings, banelings, or roaches, for timing push right around first two phoenix

3 base semi-quick infestor or hydra defense, to delay toss 3rd, or later push, or to take 4th and defend against toss immortal or 6/7 gate push around 12 minutes.

4 base with late everything, defense with queens and well placed spores

------------------

Some of these strategies can win, but are risky behaviors, and although everyone should practice all of these builds to become a better overall player, being able to choose the right builds is a very important skill as well.

1 base all ins with stuff is a risky build, relying on the opponents lack of scouting, and or mis-microing as well as being unable to deal with surprise situations. That means you are relying on him/her to screw up on 3 different things. That's a lot of power you're putting into his/her hands. If he/she does any of these things correctly, you will be hard pressed to win and be very behind in econ.

2 base quick infestors/hydras + roaches, or zerglings will still depend on slight surprise but is a much safer build, especially because it also encompasses defense against quick 1 gate pressure while the toss brings up the stargate. Pushing out without anti air can be very risky, so if you're going for a quick timing push, going hydras is recommended. But since they move so slow you will require very good creep spread, almost to the point where you either make more queens, or prioritize spreading directly to your opponent's base.

3 base is the most widely used build that allows for a very greedy economic advantage but require some knowledge of timings that the Protoss can use. A good Protoss will do an early scout push with 2 zealots, or 1 zealot and 1 stalker, and if not properly handled, can lead to a pretty big hit on the budding econ. The good Protoss will then transition quickly into something for either another timing push or harass.

Against air most zerg will build a spore at each base, get out 1 more queen, and then go for infestors. If the defense goes right, the zerg will be at an economical advantage, and once the 4th macro hatch is set, will be able to deftly handle the 2nd push that will come around 15 minutes (time is added because gas was used for phoenix harass).

4 base, again, relies on a lack of scouting very late, which will most likely not happen. Another con related to this build is the amount of space that is required to be traveled. Just because a pheonix harass is happening does not mean the toss cannot send 4 zealots into your 4th and snipe it. A risky and silly maneuver that could only work relying in the fallacies of the player.

----------------

The idea behind the Toss's build and harass, is to slow down the Zerg for as long as needed until the Toss can push in at a certain time with forces of equal mineral and gas value, but with greater advantages in battles when working in synergy. IE: Immortals, stalkers, zealots, warp prism, sentries. Plus whatever phoenix are left can be a deadly deadly push.

Many Zergs allow this to happen, because of the use of the most popular 3 base technique. It leads to a gambling situation of greed, where if the Zerg defends properly, and is able to tech quickly enough, they will win in a fierce micro battle. But overall are always going for the max money army to win the game for them.

--------------------------

My suggestion for mid level players+ is to, instead of going for a quick 3rd, go for a later third. And as soon as you see the toss going quick phoenix, go for a timing of your own.

So lets look at some of the 2 base pushes, what can we do that does not force us into risky situations? (And no matter which build you use, always remember to enforce with at least 1 queen and 1 spore at each place. For Plat and down, make 2 spores and 1 queen at each place. Better to lose a bit of money now than lose 16 drones)

1. Mass zerglings: let's say you just make a ton of zerlings, can you win? Will you be able to break their front? If the Toss spots you going for mass zerglings, all he/she has to do is make 3 sentries, and make a couple more cannons. Especially on maps with small ramps to the 2nd, you will have a lot of problems with breaking in. All the while, the phoenix will be harassing your base. Even though you could transition into a 3rd, unless you can get some setnries and probes, you will be in a losing situation, since you're only helping him/her make more sentries for his/her 15 minute army.

2. Zerlings and Roaches: with roaches to help your army, you would be able to break specific parts of the toss's wall faster. The problem with a handful of roaches is that phoenix can pick up the roaches and render the army useless. Instead of a ton of zerglings, now you have a lot of zerglings and a couple of dead roaches. And if you try to wait to mass up a crazy amount before you're push, they will have immortals by that time and that will, again, be GG for the roahces.

3. Roaches and Hydras: a very strong army, but as we talked about in the previous section, hydras are slow, and if you have less than 4, they will become useless as the phoenix can pick them up and yada yada yada. Also, with the quick tech up into hive, you will have less army than you would if you stayed in tier one, so the push will be less massive. Thankfully, when you push, you will probably have the hydra upgrade already, since they take so long to cross the map.

4. Roaches and Infestors: Like the hydra den, the infestor pit is relatively quick, but also like the hydra den, infestors need that Pathgen Glands upgrade or they will not be very useful for the attack (maybe 2 or 3 infested terran for your earliest infestor... not that good) And again like the hydras, the roach and infestor could won't be that big. Another issue is that if you do not fungal the phoenixes precisely, you will lose a lot of gas as the phoenix eat your infestors.

------------------

This brings us to the build I wanted to share today.
2 base, mass banelings, and speedlings. Why do I think this will work? I can answer with a couple of reasons.

1. At this time in the game, toss does not have any mass unit damage dealing units of their own. It is too early for colossi to come out as well as high templars. If they scout it, and begin to transition to make such thing, they are compromising their base defenses even further as they have very little gas for sentries. If they drop 2 more gas quickly to get more gas, you are now probably ahead mineral income wise.

2. Even with no quick tech and all sentries, it is just a matter of time... So let's say you get to the front of their base and they knew, and they put down 6 sentries. You will never make it in, but you can push and prod with your speedlings all you want. Where as with only mass zerlings, they only need 1 force field in the right location to stop all your guys, now they need to use 2~3 each time to also defend their buildings. The more zerlings and banelings you keep on threatening with, the more sentries they have to make. Thank means they can't push out with immortals faster. They can't make cols, or templars, or even other high gas units. Just sentries. The bigger your forces get the more they have to prepare. And if they don't make more sentries, you will push in, and things will burst, and your speedlings will go everywhere.

3. At some point you can expand behind this: At some point the returns for the continuous zerglings won't be necessary, because you'll just be infront of their base with a ton of stuff and the Toss will be trying to mass up whatever they have, to deal with your pressure. This is a perfect time to expand. The phoenix can't do anything about it, so why not? My suggestion is to go for the 3rd first, since you'll be mineral heavy, and then the lair, and then a macro. All of these are to keep more zerglings and drones popping, as well as get those infestors before the timing if you're push fails.

--------------------------------

I feel like the chances of your push failing are minimal. You are forcing force fields out of your opponent for very cheap prices, and if even one force field is incorrect they will have to deal with a huge upset of units. That kind pressure can break people's macro juggling.

I feel like even with good scouting, you will still have the upper hand in the match. There is no time for the toss to switch from stargate to cols or templars quickly, and with sentries having to be made, the gas is very low for them

Even if we are being less greedy than most normal zergs, I feel like with a good push, we can just go back to macroing up right after, and still have even if not better playing fields.

I think most zergs who have tried baneling busts before know, what I'm talking about, and for those Zergs that have never tried a baneling bust, because it seemed too ""cheesy"" this is a build that gets rid of the cheese factor and really puts toss on the back leg.

Even with multiple spines, roaches, lings, and infestors defending, I am still losing almost all of my hatcheries!  Zealots ignore attacking units and focus the hatches/tech buildings, and if they fail to finish a building in one round they will keep being being warped in until the building is dead.  


There are 3 problems with the kind of harassment, in my opinion:

1)  All the zealots and warp prisms only cost minerals so that easily makes it a cost effective strategy for the Protoss.

2) Hatcheries are too weak!  They don't have enough health to tank the zealot damage, even with an appropriate defensive response.

3) This kind of harass requires very little micro investment for the Protoss player, they can simply warp in and a-click a hatch/tech building and go back to macroing.

**Mid Game**: Once I realized that there was indeed no rush coming, I tried to take my third as quickly as possible, and catch up on drone count. I knew that since he late expanded, there was a good chance he would be very agressive, and so I started to prepare for that. However, I didn't really get ready in time. His Zealot sentry army came right as my roaches were in production. I managed to snipe all of his sentries, and clean up a good portion of the zealots, but I still lost my base. Because of this, I feel I wasn't really able to get up the roach ling aggression I'm used to doing. Also my fourth was probably late. 

**Late Game** Now this is where I am confused as to why I lost. Despite all my struggles up to this point, I was able to reach Brood Lord tech fairly easily. Normally, once the game reaches this point, I am able to slowly whittle down the protoss stalkers, and then just eventually overrun them. However, in this game, I wasn't really able to trade efficiently. I tried to harass the expos, but the mass cannons shut that down for the most part. 
* What could I have done differently here, to put the game more into my favor? 

* How do you get a large Broodlord heavy army up, without completely exposing yourself? All the roaches take up a lot of supply, but if I sack them, then I will be in a lot of trouble when the counter attack comes. 

* What is a decent army comp to deal with this Protoss Deathball (Blink Stalker Heavy, 3-4 collosus, and a few archons)?

Whenever I play with people, there's still occasionally people who discuss hotkeys, grid, all that jazz

When I describe the solution of standardizing hotkeys, people usually seem to take a liking to it.

Because I am comfortable with FPS controls, I often use ""F"" and ""G"" for sprint, nades, melee, etc

I use F for spell #1 for every caster, G for spell #2, T for spell #3. Meaning without looking at the hotkeys, you should be able to control a templar, an infestor, or a raven with equal ease, as long as you know the order the spells are in.

I standardize upgrades as well. Attack/armor structures like evo chambers, forges, engineer bays use the same 3 keys (E A S). When I need to upgrade multiple zerg things, I can tab through them and upgrade accordingly without trying to recall what the roach regen or spire attack upgrade button is. 

That's pretty much it. Obviously you don't need to use the hotkeys I mentioned, just whatever buttons you're comfortable with. Probably too simplistic of a post.

Now:

The Coaching and Improvement session #10 will be held this Saturday, June the 23rd from 5-9PM Eastern (2-6 Pacific). ""Unscheduled"" events will probably continue into the night.

These events have been pretty successful, let's continue that!

This will be how the overall event will be run:

When the event starts, please join your appropriate channel, as follows:

* Everyone in ""Starcraft Strategy""
* Bronze-Gold players, join chat channel ""peepbsg""
* Plat/Diamond players, join chat channel ""peeppd""

This will help get things going smoothly at startup as peepmodes will be divided up by league. (Bronze-Gold Peepmode and Platinum-Diamond Peepmode, if one peepmode gets too large it may be split up into two different peepmodes).

Also, TeamSpeak 3 is a requirement, although a microphone is not. Download is available at www.teamspeak.com . Make sure to download the client (not server). The address is server.valdegames.com

The reason why TeamSpeak is a requirement is so the coaches can talk to you directly while you are playing and it’s just more efficient to communicate this way.

Lastly, streams will be less available than usual.

POCHI WILL BE STREAMING IN CASE YOU CAN'T JOIN US IN GAME: http://www.twitch.tv/pochi_tv

Currently, I am residing at 53rd in my division, a long way from the 4th place spot last season. Every match-up is uncomfortable, and I am definitely dealing with ladder anxiety.
  
Last season, PvT was my best match-up, by a wide margin. This season, though, I've lost every game but one. It seems like I always die, due to mis-macro, or just bad decision making.  
  
PvP has always been a problem for me. I have lost every game vP, as well. In the early game, I do fine, until it comes to getting down colossus, I just do not know when the best time for putting them down is, or when the best time to expand is. 
  
I have only played one game of PvZ, which was a win, but I didn't feel comfortable with it. I was trying out the 2 base robo all-in, which might have been the cause of my discomfort. The most unsettling thing about that game was how much money I was floating, over 4k mins/2k gas on 7 gates.

I kind of want to go for an only ling/bane composition for a long time, but I also really like infestors to deny drops. I also like mutas for anti-drops.

Basically... should I get 4 queens every game? When should I get my infestation pit/spire/lair? I know hive should be around 15minutes, but when should I start teching to broodlords?

I took a break from Starcrafting for about 6 months, and I have been playing on and off lately, trying to get a few games every day to keep my hands sharp.

I don't know what is going on with PvP, but everyone is either cannon rushing or 2proxy gating, mostly on Daybreak LE, Cloud Kingdom LE and Antiga Shipyard.

My current PvP record is 5-8.

2 of the 8 losses were caused by poor build order execution, got too greedy and got punished. I easily fixed that by practicing alone.

I cant say the same about the other 6 losses... All of the caused by either Proxy Gating or Cannon Rush, like I mentioned earlier, all on Daybreak, Could Kingdom and Antiga ( No proxy here, just cannon ).

I have been 9pylon scouting every single game, but since the maps above are so big, by the time I get there, the guy already has his pylon down near my base, and 2 gates on the way. 

In the case of Cannon rushes, its also really hard since on maps like Cloud Kingdom and Daybreak, they can hide a pylon outside your base and warp in, by the time I find it, the first cannon is already half way done, and if I pull probes to hold it, his probe just starts warping pylons all over my base and its gg. In Antiga Shipyard is even worse with that bullshit cannon rush behind the mineral line, cant do anything about that.

So any tips on how to deal with it? I have been able to win every single ""standard"" game so far that I didnt mess up badly in the opening ( like getting my sentry stuck between gate/pylon -_- ), but I cant hold a standard PvP cheese.

I was a Protoss the whole time, but never got farther than low gold/high silver (while playing 2-3 games per week at max). I noticed, that my macro and control was always better than that of my opponents when analyzing replays. The problem was somewhere different, but I just couldn't find it. I started experimenting with Zerg, but as I was watching dApollos Tutorials I noticed, that Terran fits my ""natural playstyle"" much better. It opened up my mind for Terrans in general. It's a strange thing.



##**What I need is a basic overview** on which build orders should be used on which map type (maps with easy to defend natural (shakuras) vs. maps with open and vulnerable natural (xelnaga caverns)) and solid openings in general. (see the edit for my reasoning)

I'm familiar with most BOs but it's still kind of muddled in my head, when to use what. **The best thing would be a clear overview, table, image chart or something like that. No fancy builds like early rushes, cheese etc. Just basic, safe and solid builds/howto's.** It's obviously not as easy as to put it in one picture due to matchup specific builds, but that's obviously a part of what I want.

Thanks alot in advance guys &lt;3



*Edit:* There are many things I should have added to explain my situation and to make it clearer what I want :3

As mentioned in the comments my problem is university. It takes all of my available time. So I could do that research by myself, but I simply don't have that time to do that. I'm also a graphical learning type. Therefore I need a clear and simple collection of data about solid builds, how to's and other information. 
I'm not looking for advice to improve my play in general. I'm a very self reflecting and analyzing person, therefore I'm pretty aware of my mistakes (considering the exorbitant ammount of SC2 related videos (day9, apollo etc.), threads, texts, posts I've already read over the 'years').

I do not want gimmicky all-ins that work against zerg, I want to understand the theory behind defeating zerg as terran. It seems to be nothing like terran and protoss. And I can't find it documented anywhere.

People tell me I need to be aggressive and delay their third. So I do. And it does nothing. I've had games where the zerg reacts to me killing their third by building 4 new expansions, which is the exact opposite of what I was trying to do. There is no system to the madness!

I also don't understand how to cope with both macro and micro at the same time in TvZ. Seems like if I need to babysit my army all the time, or it gets slaughtered by zerg units running across the map, which makes it very hard to be back in my main building stuff. And if i don't do that, I get supply blocked and have no army and die anyway.

And taking expansions is also extremely hard. Most games I lose tend to be because I fail to secure a third with lings running around killing it before it turns into a PF.

Earlier I had some success with mech, but it was a complete coin toss. Would be complete one sided roflstomp, or utter defeat. And I could never work out what was different between what I did, and the zerg did.

1333725966.0,10,self.starcraft_strategy,rwd5c,Recognizing what to do - How do I fix my game so I can play like a masters+ player?,companionx,10,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/rwd5c/recognizing_what_to_do_how_do_i_fix_my_game_so_i/,"Like some of you I have hit a point where I have plateaued and can't seem to improve. I am currently diamond with all 3 races on both SEA and NA, but I would like to focus on P and Z. I can easily handle the low masters players I get matched against, but the really solid masters players just absolutely embarrass me regardless of race. I find that I am struggling with the overall concept and flow as opposed to a single specific strategy or timing. I just can't seem to replicate what I see people doing to me. Stuff like 3 base 200 food roach push @ ~12 min mark, or just buying enough time as a P until I can get a nice deathball without being overwhelmed by said roach push. 

As a Zerg I find myself struggling with the following:

- I can never get to T3 fast enough, I always find myself stalling in the mid game vs T and P. When their heavier units start rolling out full production I eventually get overwhelmed.

- I keep up with upgrades but I always end up engaging in poor areas, leading to poor surround and getting stomped. 

- I never seem to leave the right number of units + static d at base. It is either overkill or not enough and I end up losing a lot of stuff for free.

- I struggle with doing effective counter attacks. Whether it be brofestor hitsquads, speedlings in the mineral line, or roach drop, I never seem to deal significant enough damage and always feel like I threw those units away for free.

- Late game my injects and tumors just die down. Hard. I feel pretty overwhelmed by the insane number of things I need to do.

As P:

- I always try to pressure the third too late in PvZ. My force usually gets crushed by some roach//speedlings. The games I win are only when the zerg has been cutting way too many corners for third//T2 tech.

- Similar problem as my Z where my T3 tech of choice is usually either on par with or behind my opponent's. 

- I always seem to lose sentries and have to replenish them.
                                                                                                                                                                                                   - In PvP I almost always lose if my opponent does 1 base 2 colo all in.

- In most of my games, I find that around the 10 minute mark I am very gas heavy but severely blocked on minerals. This is usually quite a good thing in PvZ if I can manage to get some templar and archons out, but I would like to re-balance my income a bit.

TL;DR:

- I never really get a feel of when to pressure or when not to. I think this has a large effect on my above problems, where I let my opponents either catch up or get ahead of me economically, and I eventually just run out of steam.

- My macro does not allow me to pull off the sexy timings that I see people doing.

- Mid game kills me. I can be very comfortable in the opening portions but once mid-&gt;late game transition I completely fall apart.

- Throwing in multi-prong drops has been met with lots of success but I can't always rely on this alone as there are definitely people who can handle it and find other ways to punish me.

If somebody could point me to a free file hosting thing I would be more than happy to attach some replays to illustrate my above points. Thanks for reading!

I've been having a big issue against Terran players lately that heavily invest in Reactored Hellions and thus seize map control, completely shutting down any early aggression avenues on my side.

While this doesn't deny a 15 Hatch by any means (and Spines &amp; Queens keep the Hellions at bay), it prevents major Creep spread and forces me into Roaches for fear of simply being overrun / having my Spines bypassed once the Hellions have reached a sizable number (8+). 

The Terran player meanwhile can safely expand and either go for a Tank / Marine / Hellion push at their leisure or do a Marauder / Hellion push, which wrecks both my defenses and whatever Roaches I have guarding my two bases.

Now, fending off the Hellions isn't what causes me headaches; I can usually regain the map quite easily after Roaches are on the field and I start moving up to Lair tech, but how do I punish the (by now fortified) Terran at this point? Since I wasn't able to put pressure on the Terran for the first 6-8 minutes of the game, he is now economically level with me.

If I grab a third, I am cutting my army size considerably and leave myself open to a timed push. Siege tanks / Marines prevent most frontal engagements, and I have yet to find a Nydus opportunity that lends itself to be beneficial for the investment. Mutalisks, while temporarily giving me map control, are usually unable to do any real harassment damage at this point.

Almost every Zerg I face in Gold goes mass roach, even seeing some hydras in there on occasion.  WHY?  For reference, I'm not meching, I'm usually going standard reactored hellion into bio+tank.  Occasionally I'll do a CC-first build.  Either way, roaches everywhere.

Aside from just wanting the reason why, I'll explain why this is a bad idea.

 * Roaches are not only horribly supply inefficient, but in ZvT, cost inefficient and don't trade well even with marines once it's more than small number.

 * Roaches don't fare well against tanks.  Really not well.  Tanks do bonus damage, so instead of the usual 35, it's 50 plus splash, on top of the bio.

 * They're relatively immobile and don't shoot up, so defending drops is terrible.

Seeing mass roach is seeing a free when from the Terran perspective.  Just bio+tank push with a decent ball and it's a win.

What roaches are good for ZvT:

 * A few to get rid of early hellions and expand for a third

 * Supporting an all-in bust

 * A core unit against mech play (though on their own you have to be conscious of the tank count)

What this may lead to is either making decisions too late because of bad macro, or really good macro but using a build that is really weak. My solution? Work on both in a completely different situation. 

For the past month or so, I've been playing a lot of monobattles in the custom games section. I play random, and always have my units randomly chosen. I've noticed my score at the end of the game go from 1-6 to 1-2 consistently, regardless of race/units. What's going on here?

To start, you make workers all the time. Don't cheese, as the point is to have fun and get better. Just constantly make workers. This is always addressed in macro advice for a reason. Are you making workers all the time? Good. You're now ahead of most players. 

Now, you may be thinking that there are no decisions to be made. Incorrect. I'll give two extreme examples. 

Let's say you roll marines. Great. Easy to make, easy to use. However, you need to max as quickly as possible as well as get upgrades, expand, and deny opponent expansions. So, you need to make enough barracks to keep your minerals low (easy on one base, tough on two or more). You do this by adding a barracks every now and then to ensure you're constantly building from everything. Also, add two engineering bays to get upgrades. So, you have to decide when to add barracks, when to expand and when to move out. Pretty easy compared to the ladder

You can also roll carriers. Uh oh. Tier 3 tech will result in a LOT of extra minerals. You know what only costs minerals? Nexuses and cannons. These are your mineral sinks. The point of carriers is to hold off on tech while you secure bases and feed your allies resources. You'll produce maybe two carriers at a time off of one base, so you NEED those expansions. You also need two cybernetics cores and one forge going for upgrades. That in itself is a LOT of gas. So deciding to expand isn't really a tough choice. 

So what's the point of all this? What's the end result?

You learn to expand and secure the expansions. You learn to get your upgrades going. You learn to make unit-producing buildings only when you need them.

You don't lose points for a loss, so just have fun. You're not going to win them all, as rolling all air-air units is an instant loss. Just relax and make the only unit you can. 

Eventually, you move to other games and realize you can make other units. You'll see every combination in monobattles, so you'll see what counters what and how.

1323116391.0,10,self.starcraft_strategy,n1hx8,[D] Protoss over-gateway reactionary style,defektt,10,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/n1hx8/d_protoss_overgateway_reactionary_style/,"**Preface:**  Before someone digs it up and tells me I have no business talking about strategy: I’m a diamond Protoss (Top diamond when I’m playing, but other games have had my attention lately).  I know diamond is basically average around here, and I presume no superior knowledge or skill whatsoever in making this post.  I’m just a guy who likes Starcraft 2 and had an idea I wanted to discuss with the community.  As I’ve said before, I’ve not been playing a whole lot recently, and also recently switched to a new hotkey setup (my own version of grid).  Therefore, I haven’t really tested this out much, and can’t provide any good replays.  This is pretty much pure theorycrafting.  Please don't crucify me. :) 
***      

**The Idea:**  A strategy for Protoss which involves overproducing gateways which could enable them to adopt the Zerglike ability to quickly switch from economic growth to military production.  This is something Day[9] has theorized about frequently, and even gone so far as to call “the future of Protoss”; this discussion will expand upon his ideas.
***       

**The Theory:** The name of the game in Starcraft 2 is to do everything you can to get ahead of your opponent economically while staying alive.  The longer you can hold off on creating an army, the better.  This is because of the “time-value of money”, the same theory behind why we don’t queue up units – in general, you don’t want to spend money on something unless it will immediately grant you something in return.  As an example, having an army that sits idle and doesn’t accomplish anything is a waste of resources.  Creating this standing army is something Protoss and Terran have traditionally done as a measure of safety. It’s difficult to produce a lot of units quickly with these races, so in order to be prepared for an eventual battle, a player will typically stockpile an army and produce out of all production structures constantly. Zerg don’t have to do this as often, however, because they are capable of switching gears extremely quickly.  There are two primary assets Zerg have that enable them to hold off on creating massive armies, and they are:
 
•	The larva mechanic, which enables them to use the same structures they use to generate econ to also generate an army.  They only have to spend money on one roach warren in order to generate dozens of roaches at a time, provided they have the larvae.  
 
•	Innate scouting / map control with creep spread and overlord vision.  This isn’t to say that either of these things is perfect – it’s quite easy for an opponent to deny overlords from an early stage, and to stop creep as soon as they have detection, but the advantage Zerg has here is that creep allows them to have vision of a large portion of the map with hatcheries only, using units they have to make anyway (overlords for supply, and an inexpensive additional queen to start creep spread)
 
The proposed strategy utilizes Protoss tools to emulate the aforementioned Zerg characteristics.  These Protoss tools are:
 

•	The warpgate mechanic.  This allows Protoss to create a batch of units in just four seconds.  In addition, Chronoboosting gateways drastically decreases the cycle time for warp-ins.  
 
•	Space-controlling units.  The sentry and the high templar manipulate space very effectively.  This is important because controlling space and forcing an enemy to retreat or stay away buys a Protoss player time to warp in an army in a pinch.
*** 

**The Plan:**  The Protoss player should aim to spend the vast majority of their minerals on economic gain (nexii, probes, pylons) and mass gateways.  The majority of gas will be spent on sentries and (later) high templar.  These sentries and templar should be split up and stationed at each base for defense in case of harassment/attack. Forcefields downright prevent entry in the absence of massive units, while storms force an opponent to choose between temporary retreat and massive damage.  Both of these units buy a Protoss time to warp in a large gateway force.  Observers should also be scattered around the map to grant vision and advance warning of an incoming attack.  
*** 

**Advantages:**  The Protoss minimizes idle units.  The units which will be produced for defense, sentries and high templar, start gaining energy immediately, which is a return on investment.  Additionally, these units are very effective when used for drop harass; two HTs and two sentries can wipe out an entire mineral line in seconds if controlled well.  Observers are effective as scouts because they require detection to eliminate and they will spot invisible units well in advance (important because cloaked ghosts are a major bane of a sentry/HT heavy strategy).  The primary idle investments necessary are the excess gateways, but a gateway only costs about the same as one gateway unit, and grants much more than that in return.  Upon scouting an incoming enemy army, a gateway should be able to produce 2 units, maybe 3, before the army can force an engagement.  
 ***

**Weaknesses:**  Requires careful management and awareness.  In the early game, the player doesn’t have much scouting or vision of the map and is very vulnerable to timing attacks.  They also haven’t yet reaped any benefits of an economic advantage.  In addition, there are several types of harassment an opponent might use which will require the Protoss to exercise very good control.  The most threatening types of harassment involve mutalisks, cloaked banshees, or baneling drops – basically anything that can assault your base without coming in the front door.  In the later game, an opponent may have massive units which render forcefields worthless as a defense.  If you look at this weakness by matchup, however, there are ways to control this risk.  Protoss massive units are archons and colossi; void rays are very good against both.  There may be a point in the game where it will become necessary to begin stockpiling void rays, as they’re generally good in this matchup anyway.  The same is true for PvZ; void rays are good against most zerg units (all but hydras, mutas, infestors), and excel against brood lords which enter into pretty much every late game matchup.  In PvT, the only massive ground unit is the Thor, which is energy based and is vulnerable to feedback.  
 ***

**Summary:**  Protoss overproduces gateways, uses them to make mass sentries and templar for defense/stalling/drop harass, spends minerals on expanding and bolstering economy, scatters observers for advance warning of incoming attack.  Upon an enemy moving out, Protoss stops economic production, warps in units as fast as possible, chronoboosting gateways.  Protoss stalls with sentries/templar while dropping on undefended bases.  This passive/reactionary style allows for faster-than-usual economic growth.  This strategy makes the Protoss weak against air harass, such as mutas, drops, banshees.  It could also be weak against early timing attacks.
 
***
What do you guys think?  Is this something that could be viable?  If so, which matchups do you see it working best in?  What do you think the biggest challenges would be in executing this kind of strategy?

Depending on time, I play Starcraft either a lot, or once a week in a Bronze-Gold tournament at [SCVRush](http://scvrush.com/). I usually manage to get to the upper rounds of the competition, but there I am usually crushed by the same Protoss opponent - who probably belongs a league or two higher, but anyway.

My usual approach is that I 1Rax FE in the open if it's a map that favours it, or else I build the CC in my base and float it over after OC. Depening on scouting, number of gases and Nexus energy, I respond with a number of bunkers, and afterwards try to play a straight bio macro game. Depending on mid-game P tech decision, I respond with the standard vikings or ghosts.

I am in need of help, as I feel that I may be doing things wrong, and after listening to the commentary that the tournament caster made, I need someone more experienced to tell me what I should focus on more, or what it is that I'm doing wrong.

I've attached a couple of replays from various matches against the guy (Jalkloben) and against one of my Toss friends (Govinda).

I would appreciate any sort of support - whether I should focus more on SCVs, my general game plan, the engagements, drops or any observations related to my play.

Hope someone can help!

**Update after awesome advice I got:**

I decided to play vs. my good Protoss training buddy, and have tried to apply as much of the excellent advice that I received from you all!

I'll post two replays - one in which I fail, and one in which I win by a big margin.

* http://www.sc2replayed.com/replay-videos/15829
* http://www.sc2replayed.com/replay-videos/15830

In the first one, the one that I fail, it's the fact that I scouted a Templar Archive and thought that he would be going archons, so I decide to get ghosts. In fact, he went colossi. After watching the replay and analysing my performance, I realised that there was a window in which I had a 40 supply lead, and even with the tech disadvantage, I should have been able to do significant damage.

Taking this knowledge, I decided to move around 180 food in the second replay, knowing that he would be around 140ish because of his build. I won. I then watched all of the 10 or so matches that we played today, and noticed that I always have this window of opportunity, but I concluded that it may be so because of my opponent.

I would be very grateful if you could tell me whether I've adjusted correctly based on your advice.

I also have a question regarding the number of raxes - do I go for a specific number of raxes per base? What would you say is a right amount of raxes for 3 bases? How about 4 bases?

In the second replay I also go for double ebay, and manage to get 2-2 quite early (rather than my previous experience of it being something you do in the ""late game""). Is this ok? Or should I start of with 1 Ebay, and then place down a second?

1321584716.0,10,self.starcraft_strategy,mggq7,[D] Revisiting 3-gate expand in PvZ,kengou,12,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/mggq7/d_revisiting_3gate_expand_in_pvz/,"On a whim, I recently decided to go back to the 3-gate expand.  You know, the old beta build everybody stopped doing from fear of a roach-ling attack.  I wanted to be more aggressive against Zerg in general, without doing all-ins every game, to stifle Zerg powering his econ or tech.  Turns out it works really, really well so far!  I expand at the 6 minute mark, throw down a 4th gateway, warp in a round of zealots and go attack.  Against ling defenses (i.e. a muta/infestor/baneling rush) zealot+sentry crushes face, and even against small numbers of roaches zealots do well with forcefields.  If I show up and Zerg already has a good number of roaches, I retreat, having forced lots of units.  If Zerg goes for a greedy 3rd (before 7 minutes) I can kill it almost every time.  If Zerg is doing the fearsome roach-ling attack, Zealots and sentries and some build sim-city at the natural can defend it without the need for DTs or void rays.  Most maps offer more protected naturals nowadays than they used to when 3-gate expand was dying to this sort of attack.  Huk was holding off these attacks with zealot+sentry even back on those maps, so it's not impossible.

Being aggressive earlier and more constantly throughout the game makes it hard for Zerg to drone a lot or invest a lot of money into tech (like making 15 mutas at once!).  All of the troubles everybody (including myself) have had with mutalisks after a forge FE is lessoned, I believe, by this type of early aggression.  Zerg does not have such early access to 6 gas geysers.  If Zerg tries to go roach to defend aggression before a big muta switch, he can't just crank out a huge flock of mutas all at once if you're always in his face threatening him.  I really try to always be poking at the Zerg's front and showing him my army without committing too far - sometimes, engage for just a second before backing off so he can't know if you will always fake the aggression.  

I've played against Zergs trying to get mutas out after opening roach-ling-hydra to defend my aggression, and they just can't.  My army will catch him with 3 or 4 mutas with the rest of his army while I have colossus, and the next time I engage him all he has are corruptors.  There's just no time or resources for any huge muta switch, which normally would be afforded if I had gone Forge FE.

Anyway, I'd love to drive more discussion about this in light of the zillion threads on here and teamliquid containing mutalisk fear.  I had the same problems while forge FEing every single map.  But ever since I started going back to 3-gate expo with a ton of aggression and pressure, the matchup feels so much more manageable!",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_mggq7,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/mggq7/d_revisiting_3gate_expand_in_pvz/,
1318583879.0,10,self.starcraft_strategy,lbvx3,PvZ: Securing a third,Astra2,11,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/lbvx3/pvz_securing_a_third/,"I'm a platinum protoss and in my most recent PvZs, the outcome of the game seems to hinge pretty heavily on whether or not I can get up a timely third base, unless I'm doing some sort of two base all-in. 

What are some good ways to secure a third base? This is most likely coming out of a forge FE. In PvZ taking a third recklessly can lead to a pretty easy denial by zerg or can leave the front of your natural vulnerable, especially if you didn't wall it off completely or didn't FFE. I find the struggle is particularly tough against muta/ling styles.

I usually find that I need some substantial AOE damage before I can use my army to assert some control and take a third. My forcefield usage is far from perfect and I'm sure it's also situational, but that is the bulk of my experience, and sometimes I feel like the safety of AOE comes too late to take a well timed third.

There's also the obvious things such as making a wall and cannons at your third. How often do you wall off your third completely? Only against counter-attack heavy styles, or is it almost always a good idea? In my experience I find that kind of simcity is actually a rather large hindrance to the ability to hold off muta harass, but at the same time is almost necessary to not have zerglings in your base when you move out.

What maps do you consider the easiest/hardest to take a third on? Are there some where you would almost never consider taking a third? On a semi-related note, Shakuras Plateau is pretty much my favourite map, the natural ramp is a godsend. On that map, do you like to take the natural of the base across from you or the natural third (the one inside the cliff of the main base)?

I'm awful at scouting for two reasons: I often get tunnel vision when playing SC2 (how do I get rid of that, by the way?), and 99% of the time I don't really know what I am looking for. For example, if I see a roach warren earlier than 5:45, I should put a Robo down immediately right? (some say Stargate?) **What are some rules of thumb for scouting at Gold level?**

**At what point am I to stop producing probes?** Say I am doing One-base colossus, or if I am being contained inside one base -- do I stop producing probes once I have 23 or so? And then just focus on army? I always hear to never stop building probes, but sometimes in the same breath they would see a replay and say ""dude whyyyyy are you making probes, newb?""

**When I see the opponent has a third base just coming up, and I have yet to put mine down, what do I do?** Am I forced into attacking that base? I feel I would be behind if I just expanded myself, but if I attack and lose then he would be even more ahead. One game I punished a guys third on Shakuras and he didn't let me out, killed all my army. Was that worth knocking down his third?

**Do I always go Attack Upgrade first? When would I go armor?** For that matter, when do I double forge?

Up to this point in the game, I've gotten by purely on a stronger macro, but it's all been about feel. I hardly follow build orders. Instead I just make sure units are always being produced and my money is always low. If I have a lot of money then, by god, we are going SG whether we wanted to or not.

Any help would be awesome, thanks Reddit.

Basically, at 10 minutes, once you're fully saturated on 3 bases and taking your fourth, you drop your infestation pit and spire (could go hydra den instead). Mass hosts and corruptors/mutas/hydras and march. Make sure you bring a few overseers to allow the hosts to detect stealthed units. 

I'd recommend going heavy with the static defenses while you macro up and try to bank as much gas as possible. I've had the most success with massing speedlings since you will be floating a lot of minerals. Of course you could opt for roaches but the idea is to bank as much gas as possible so you can mass your hosts along with whatever anti air unit you decide to go with. 

As for upgrades, I recommend getting at least 2/2 into melee (melee to make your lings more effective at protecting you early game; if you decide to go roaches then def put it into range) and carapass. Also go for extended locust life from your infestation pit— makes your pushes a lot stronger and keeps your opponent turtled longer. 

Pretty much only use your lings and anti air as reinforcement in case your opponent pokes out in between locust spawns or tries to harass with air units(definitely use a group of lings to maintain map control while you're focused on your hosts). Other than that, stay out of the way and it's only a matter of time before you get the gg. 

Looking for critiques as well. I don't have a detailed order of the build on paper, but also feel free to ask any questions.

Resource-for-resource nothing seems to win. Air units win, of course, but none of them are particularly good at killing hellbats.

In theory with several minutes of micro stalkers can come out on top, but that's not viable for any number of reasons. 

A critical mass of collosi does work (as it does against almost anything on the ground), but collosi isn't a good response to mech in general, and a simple combo of hellbats+vikings would obviously be devastating, as I would say that even stalker+collosi would probably not fair well against hellbat+viking (hellbats will happily eat any stalkers trying to get to the vikings).

Immortals lose as well, mostly because hellbat are bio and not armored.

Archons (which a lot of people seem to be pointing to as the direct counter) actually loses resource-for-resource despite their bonus against bio (and that's mostly gas against minerals too).


The only thing on the ground that seems to work are HT, but HT beat virtually anything that doesn't stay out of the storms anyway, so that's not really saying much.

Since widow mines cant detect, its generally pretty safe to move out, and continue trying to do what you do in your base, because we lower leaguers dont have 150+ apm to spend clearing out mine feilds.  

For an even stronger push, get a nydus in thier main, and have it poop like 12 zerglings for some free damage.  It also forces him to spend more APM which is precious in lower leagues.

This is only viable for so long, because its really not hard to get a raven out at the 13 minute mark.  The goal is to hit him before he has enough units that his detection becomes a problem.  For example, you can slam his front with 30 roachs with speed and burrow on two bases at the 13 minute mark.

Zerg's economy was so devastated from his all-out rush that he forfeited the match after his second wave fell flat.

However, many times toss will one base expo and the game goes macro mode, which is a little less fun for me. So I've been looking into the cc first build in order to goad protoss into attacking early, which will provide me for the early game action I so desire and gives me a HUGE Econ advantage in the early mid game if I can hold toss off. So my question is, what is a good build order to use for cc first, and should I go for marauders early to hold off the stalkers or lots of rines/ bunkers? two stalkers harass hurts me bad with only rines but it's hard to keep up scv and unit production with the  two refineries gotten around 22 supply needed for marauders.

I'm spending the summer in Germany b/c I have an internship, so I went ahead and got an EU account. On NA I'm a recently promoted Masters Zerg player; on EU i'm sitting pretty solidly mid-diamond. Not saying EU is necessarily harder; could just be that I got inexplicably worse somehow. Or maybe stylistic differences in the metagame are to blame. Seems like there are a lot more banshees over here. Maybe they're produced by BMW or something.

At any rate, I've been playing 6 to 12 games a day, and a few of them wound up being good enough (or funny enough) that I started setting the replays aside. The replay pack I am posting here contains 10 games that stood out to me for one reason or another. Although it is possible that no one is interested, I would appreciate some feedback on my play.

Weaknesses I am currently aware of (just to make clear that I recognize how much room I have to improve):
- bad macro
- bad micro
- horrible understanding of timings (this is an area I would love some help on)
- forgetting tech. durrr

This isn't a [H] thread because I can generally figure out why I lost in a given game by looking at the replay. 10 out of 12 of these games are wins anyway. However, they do show me playing at more or less my best — and I'd appreciate feedback of any kind on that.

My other hope with this replay pack is that it might provide some guidance for lower-level players, and to that effect I will be making myself available in this thread to anybody in gold or lower who wants to know why I do something in one of these games, or wants to know when a given strategy works, or whatever else. Sometimes (perhaps often) the answer to ""why did I do X"" will be ""because I'm a shit player,"" but maybe there's some stuff I can help you with too.

1338323533.0,9,self.starcraft_strategy,uavrq,[s] Let us discuss a particular GSTL match from last night's TL vs Zenex,DUCKVILLELOL,12,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/uavrq/s_let_us_discuss_a_particular_gstl_match_from/,"Obviously spoilers ahead; you've been warned.

Last night in the Liquid vs Zenex match, Life played against Hero on Entombed Valley, and did something I thought would only really work when I practice playing Zerg on the SEA server in ye olde gold league that account is in; 3rd base before pool.

This was a build that was sometimes used in SCBW, but due to the nature of cannon rushing bases in SC2 it isn't really that viable at all - or so I thought.

I was trying to brainstorm last night to see what other options you could go with to try and deal with this build, and while I had a few, I wasn't entirely sure on whether they were viable or not.

For context: Hero went for what looked to be an early 5/6 gate attack (can't remember exactly, someone please correct me) - but lost his proxy pylon on the map, and was forced back. Interestingly after Hero lost the pylon, Life went ahead and made about 10 drones, so if Hero had of gone for the push regardless I still think he would have been in a good spot.

I think the 3rd hatch *needs* to be punished somehow, letting a Zerg get away with that is essentially putting yourself in a ""15 minute no rush let me macro bro"" position that will snowball as the game goes on (as we clearly saw from the way Life played it out). So I feel like something really needs to be done if you come up against it; but what? 

* 4gate?
* 1 base blink stalker aka Nazgul blink stalker attack?
* Cannon up that third like a gaulzi boss?
* Take your third nexus super fast too?
* 2 base carriers? (only semi-trolling, I was actually thinking of this)

I think - being a risky eco player - I'd probably go for a cannon rush and/or contain on the third, and *also* take the third nexus down at the nat super fast. He won't have many roaches out because of the slow pool and the investment in drones needed, and you would only need 1-2 cannons at the third to keep it protected. Again, that's just my risky-eco style so I'm not sure.

I open hatch / gas / pool and scout the toss regularly (sending in an ovie at around 6, 8, and 10 minutes) while doing my best to deny his 3rd with lings (all my problems come from a FFE opening). 

Around the time that I die I am on 3 bases with good saturation (generally from 50 to 60 drones with a few spines / 1 creep-queen) ((also depending on perceived threat / map size -- i.e. ""can I deny his third safely with a few roaches"")) 

--but then the toss kicks his army production into high-gear and comes and whomps my face with a medium-sized deathball* that I can't deal with. When this happens I have a few infestors (say 3-5), a good number of roaches (number varies) and, if I scouted the robo bay, 6 or so corruptors. My positioning may vary but generally I have decent creep spread (thanks to early map control) and can attack from 2 sides but it always seems like my army just isn't enough...

*Gateway army, ranging in composition but generally heavy on stalkers/zealots with a few sentry's &amp; 2-4 collosus or 3-5 immortals

Oh, I also manage my larva injects very well (it's the only thing I can honestly say I'm good at). 

I'd upload a replay but my cats chewed through my computer's power supply and my spare cords are in storage. 

tl;dr how do _you_ deal with protoss pushes between 9 and 13 minutes? wtf am I doing wrong? =[

other sidenotes:
Generally I have 2/2 started or done when the push occurs (ranged / carapace) 
Usually counterattacks are out of the question unless I'm willing to force a base-race. Protoss armies tend to kill buildings faster than I am able to with just lings/roaches/IT's

1334520899.0,11,self.starcraft_strategy,sb7sg,PvZ Skytoss build under development,NauticalInsanity,14,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/sb7sg/pvz_skytoss_build_under_development/,"Hi SC-strategy. I've been working on an air-based PvZ game and wanted to share some of my experience and prompt some discussion. [Here's](http://replayfu.com/download/6zmJwg) an example replay that encompasses much of the execution of this build. I've had an incredible winrate vs. zerg with it. The build revolves around keeping ahead on zerg with air upgrades while producing phoenixes, void rays and carriers off of four stargates, then adding on HTs for late-game engagements. The build so far:

**Early Game**

I do a typical forge fast expand. A tight wall-off with buildings works here since you won't need to break anything down to attack. Your typical scouting and response for a forge fast expand apply here, and one can be extra-generous with cannons just to be safe. Take both gasses at your main shortly after your gateway. Chrono as many probes as you can and rally zealots outside your wall. With your first 350 gas get two stargates and warp gate. You can try to be sneaky with their placement to hide them, but denying scouting is not part of this build. When take an early two gasses at your natural. At 3 zealots, send them across the map to check for incoming attacks and a third. 

**Mid Game**

Produce 3 void rays from your two stargates and start +1 air weapons. If you scouted a third from zerg with your three zealots, send the void rays across the map to attack the third and begin producing phoenixes, rallied onto your void rays. Lift queens with your phoenixes and focus fire down any spore defense that stands between you and the hatch. Zerg's third will likely fall unless they massively overproduce spores and queens. If you scout no base, chill in your base until you have three phoenixes then send them out to scout around while leaving your void rays home to defend. No matter what in the first 10 minutes, do not lose any of your void rays. 

As your phoenixes are building, your gas will pool up. Start your fleet beacon while maintaining phoenix production. When the fleet beacon finishes, start two carriers from your stargates. While they are building, add on two more stargates. When +1 air weapons finishes, start +2. When your first two carriers finish, you can hit a nice timing attack with 3 voids, 2 carriers and 7+ phoenixes. Behind this take your third. Through the midgame add gateways, zealots, and cannons. 

**Late Game**

Take LOTS of bases. Gas is your biggest limiting factor, so expansions are cheaper to take. Once you get to 3+ bases, you have to tech to high templar. Corruptors tend to bunch up, and hydras are incredibly weak to storm. If zerg has a lot of lings, keep your HTs in warp prisms and drop them to storm. A good rule of thumb also is 2 stargates for every base.

**Execution and responses**
I've found that the responses to zerg are counter-intuitive. Other than 2-base muta (lol) zerg trying to kill your army is the exact response you want and means you should be aggressive, rather than defensive. If you see:

* An ultra-fast 3rd: kill it if you can. If you fail, stay defensive with your slow air and be active with phoenixes to scout their tech. You can take a much earlier 3rd if you don't kill theirs, because generally their third will be alive because they made a bunch of spores and queens and won't have a huge number of drones or units to kill you.

* Hydras: My favorite thing to see from zerg. Seriously. Focus mainly on making phoenixes and carriers. You should always have at least 10-15 phoenixes especially when zerg makes hydras. Try to engage them off creep. A-move with your slow air and spam graviton beam with your phoenixes and you will be amazed how quickly their hydra force melts.

* Corruptors: Less pathetic than hydralisks. Focus more on void ray production and take earlier bases. Because you started air attacks so early you should have an upgrade advantage on them and can trade pretty efficiently for a while. Phoenix range helps a bit against them as well. Ultimately you'll want high templar to help deal with the hydra-corruptor combination. Luckily, on two bases, zerg doesn't have the gas count to make threatening numbers of hydras and corruptors. 

* Infestors: I haven't seen a lot of infestor responses to my build. I've mostly just gotten earlier observers, faster bases and just maintained creep until I was ready to push out with the deathball. If you engage into a force that has infestors, keep your phoenixes off to the side to flank and lift every one of them.

* Roach-ling: Seriously, the best response I've seen. If you see zerg massing roaches, DEFEND. Keep your slow air at home to keep them away and stay on the map with your phoenixes. Base trade scenarios often don't pan out well.

* Mutalisks: Start phoenix range, open up chat and call your foe terrible, because they are handing you the game on a platter.

It's not perfect yet. Minerals tend to pile up quickly and I don't have a good way to spend them. Zealots seem like the obvious answer, but I find that they just eat up supply and are not very effective in head-on fights. Keeping a few around really help with defense, but it's hard to be offensive with them without just throwing them away. It's also very dependent on keeping your army alive, just like mech for terran. Also, it's likely that I win so much purely because zerg doesn't expect me to produce mass air.

For reference he has used it against DRG and NesTea so far and beaten both of them.

For those who don't know the build it revolves around using Phoenix with +1 air weapons to deter mutalisks while taking a third base and pressuring the zerg. It's a super safe build with a ton of options available to the protoss. 

Now I've been trying it recently and my last game made me realize just how damn good this build is. With proper micro you can fend off a large ball of mutalisks. Even though I was just pumping out phoenix from 1 stargate I was able to micro and pick off mutalisks trying to get into my base.

What is nice about this is that the zerg cannot just go and attack probes without having his mutalisks ravaged. It means that every time the zerg enters your base he has to play a micro war against phoenix. 

Now obviously the downside is you need to micro well. However I honestly felt like microing my phoenix was much easier than trying to have blink stalkers and ht's with storm everywhere. The phoenix are *so* much more mobile and useful. 

Of course eventually you'll probably want to get blink and HT's anyways but you can hold off their harassment for an incredibly long time with phoenix. 

TL;DR: what do you guys think about Genius's +1 phoenix build against zerg who go mutalisks? Have any of you been using it on the ladder?

FFE, puts a canon at the wall of his second to prevent me from running in lings

The build is ""inspired"" from CatZ Stream, most notably his ZvZ vs Nestea (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alLQ9VhrZXs)

I did alot of searching around to try and find the build, or something, similar, but failed, so I tried to make my own, with taking notes from CatZ game.


At the moment, it seems to be a risky build early on, I've found myself dying to some ling/bane all ins, although that was me just failing to scout, 1 or 2 spines could've stopped that with the help of the queens.


I play definisively with it and saturate my main and natural ASAP, and go hyper aggresive when the 1/1 hits which is around 11 minutes in-game time.


My current build:

14 Gas

~~Off Gas at 350

14 Pool

~~Meta Boost when Pool Finishes

Expansion Hatch when determined with scout that it's safe

Evo Chamber after, I need to work out timing on this, so it finishes as I get the 100 gas needed for +1 Attack, +1 Carapace as soon as it Attack finishes.

Macro Hatch and queen shortly after stopping drone production.

Just before I attack, I take 3 gas, put 3 back on the original geyser, expand, and drop a roach warren and save larvae for now, then when I'm back to 100 gas start the lair.

Normally the attack is with about 80 Zerglings.


When I get to opp base: Send 1 ling in, see what's at the ramp:
Defensive Banelings: This is the hard counter, if I see this, I just take my losses, I expand and sit my lings outside the enemy base, preventing them from moving out for now and using them to contain while I expand, drone up my third and start +1 missiles and begin a tranisition into . Sometimes, if there's only a few banes, I would try to take them out with micros.


Roaches: If they aren't on the ramp, I kill them providing I have enough lings, lings are cost effective vs both +0 and +1 Attack Roaches, as the +1 Carapace means they need 3 shots to kill the Lings regardless, while continuing to rally in Zerglings and making a few drones inbetween to start saturating the third. If they're on the ramp, I take the natural and kill it if possible, as he will need to either move off the ramp, meaning I can kill them, or I can kill the natural, either is good, taking the Roaches means I will probably win, taking the natural gives me a great advantage being 2 bases and 3 hatcheries up.


That's all I have atm, after I get saturation on the main and natural mineral lines it's Zerglings all the way until the attack, Macro hatch and queen is needed for the extra larvae.


Obviously, this is providing the first 10 minutes goes fine, sometimes it may be delayed a little bit to deal with early shennigans./

Ever since I started playing against higher rated diamonds (been top 8 for a bit but starting to play better players who are also top 8) **every single terran** I have played has done a 1 base all-in.

I have no problem winning a macro game against them. None. I probably win 95% of my macro games against terran. My problem is that I am getting all-in'd in every which way I'd ever had fucking imagined. Here is a short list of what I have faced in the past couple of days alone.

* 1/1/1 (several variants of this including a version with a thor and SCV pull for repair)

* 1/1 Marine/Tank 

* 3 rax marauder/marine

* 3 rax reactor mass marine (just lost to this cute bugger, on tal'darim too)

* 2 rax marineSCV rush (actually held this one)

And then there have been the very rare 2 base timing attacks too. Most of my games in the past few days against terran haven't gone very long.

I need to know what to watch out for. For example I just went up against this 3 rax mass marine. I scouted. i saw a rax, a late gas. I figured he was going to do an early expand (Tal'darim mind you). I scouted back later and saw a 2nd rax (couldn't see add-ons) so I figured it was a 2 rax. I expanded and got my army up and got pushed in by an estimate of a million marines.

Now I'm just not entirely sure what to do here. I understand what certain things mean. Hell, I kind of understand how to beat several of these builds. The problem is is that I get absolutely buttfucked trying to guess which cute all-in is going to come my way because so many of them look THE EXACT SAME EARLY ON. I always poke later with a probe to try and get a better look but it doesn't always help if the Terran has even a portion of his brain available to him.

So how should I go about this? Should I just try and get halluc every time, spend the 100/100 for it? Or should I go for a robo and hope that I didn't just waste 200/100 if it ends up being mass marine or a 1/1/1 that I need a starport to stop?

Lots of ideas have been tried against this build, most to no real avail.  Today, Tassadar in Game 2 against Yoda, on Crossfire, showed some really interesting ideas that made me think a lot.  He stayed 1-base and opened phoenix, to shut down the banshee play and delay the push by harassing Terran.  He then went for a fast zealot charge upgrade.  After that he researched blink.  When Yoda moved out, Tassadar attacked into the army, lifting 3 of the tanks at once and hitting with blink stalkers and chargelots.  And he lost.

Even so, I'm feeling like the phoenixes into chargelots is a really good response, in theory.  Blink was the only part of this build I didn't quite understand, and I felt like he had too few Zealots and too many Stalkers in the final engagement.  But chargelots means the tank splash will hit marines, and it should only be a matter of time before the fast Zealot reenforcement waves should whittle down the marine-tank army.  And banshees, the primary reason a Toss has to make stalkers against this composition, don't pose any thread because of the phoenixes.

So I intend to start trying out getting phoenixes and chargelots against this type of play, to see how it works.  I think that cutting gas mining and going for TONS of zealots might work.  Or, perhaps, rushing to archons off 1 base to spend gas, but I need to see if the timing works out.  Probably won't.

Throughout the patches zerg has been getting buffed and more people have started playing as them, up to the point where I would say 70% of my games were ZvZ.  

Im not a particular fan of doing mirror matches and so a couple weeks ago I decided to switch to terran as I hardly ever played against terran on ladder (70% zerg, 25% toss, 5% terran).

To do this i demoted myself around the end of last season in order to try terran on diamond (i knew i wasnt ready to play in masters as terran).  It has been fun except for the fact that I CAN NOT beat protoss for the life of me.  Here are the stats of my 60 games I played as terran

http://i.imgur.com/YLGcX.png
(for those who cant open im 93% win rate against Zerg, 91% win rate against terran and 28% win rate against toss :'(  )


Apparently there are protoss players in abundance in high diamond and they all pretty much walk over me.  

I can usually win if the game goes into a macro game using MMGM with vikings as necessary. Except I always seem to lose before i get to that point.

I usually lose to warp gate timing pushes (3 gate expo into 6 gate or 5 gate all in).  I have tried a variety of starts but dont seem to have consistent luck with any.  My usual opening is:

10 supply

12 rax

13 gas

2 marines then tech lab

21 CC

(after this i dont have the exact numbers down but i go)

-bunker at front as resources allow

-two more raxes

-another bunker

-facotry

What usually ends up happening is I'll scount the extra gateways and put down more bunkers but they just forcefield the bunkers so I cant repair and over-run me.


Since ive lose to that many time ill play safer and go for a 3 rax opening but when I do that the opponent always seems to go fast colossus and destroys me or 3 gate expands and holds with sentries and then im far behind because I didnt expand.

Depending on the map ill open two rax (one with TL) and put fast MM with CS pressure till warpgates finishes.

Ive also tried adding tanks to the mix, going for fast drops but nothing seems to really work consistantly.

Most of my wins have come from cheesey tactics that would probably not do any good if scouted (3 rax reaper opening, 3 rax pressure w/ bad forcefields, fast banshees) but would like be able to win consistantly without resorting to this kind of play.  Any advice would be appreciated but some main concerns

-Is 1 rax expo too gready? 

-If I two rax or 3 rax will I be too far behind if they 1 gateway expand or 3 gate expand?

-How many bunkers do I need to hold this kind of pressure?

-Are there any tells to look for so I can know forsure this is comming? (ie, against zerg if you see only 1 gas you can assume a 4 gate is comming)

Basically what I do is send a scouting drone on 13, just mess around the toss base, I 15 pool, 14 gas, @100 speed, @50 gas, evo chamber, @100 +1 melee, take drones of gas, fully saturate and full ling, with the scouting drone I build a hatch inside the protoss base, if he moves the zealot I flood in with lings, if the hatch finishes lings from inside and if he puts the sentry/stalker (whatever second unit he makes) to attack hatch I just sacrifice some lings and get in. Of course if he puts probes to attack it I just cancel, move and hatch again + he loses mining time.

Discuss, but I have not lost a single game, hatch cannot be stopped unless 6 probes are pulled and that is just a waste of minning time.

If scouting drone is being chased by probe just build assimilator and cancel fast and go build hatch.

Update: Sorry about not uploading replays, still at work, not been able to sleep for 24+ hours, will be home in a couple hours

Edit 1: I also do see that many of you think that my hatch goes down when you are ready, the hatch starts building when your zeaolt pops, so if you make a complete wall off you will not be able to hit the lings that attack the pylon and 1 zealot needs a couple of probes to kill the building hatch and I can cancel move and make it again + I am only making lings with limited amount of larva, so I get some over income to make a second base. Will get off work soon and upload replays

My best strategies vs Zerg are early game harass builds, and there are many: 2 rax, quick reactor helion, blueflame helion, reactor helion into banshee, etc. These work well vs. lower level master leaguers, but the higher level guys can handle them and I end up in the midgame on 2/3 bases vs a Zerg: and those guys LOVE to macro up like crazy. 

In particular, I've had trouble handling ling muta: not at my own base, where I know how to put up turrets galore. Rather, I want a way to play tvz without turtling and expecting the zerg to push into me; I'd like to have some reliable push timing around 14 minutes (just as he's getting his higher tech up) that doesn't get smashed by a zerg who sees it coming (typically I'll push out at 180 food with mm tank) or some similar strategy to keep him occupied while I can more safely continue to grab bases. 

One idea I've had is to take a quick third (lots of korean terrans do this), and it works because it gets up before the zerg can stop it with higher tech. However, it can be very risky on the NA ladder if you're opponent is intelligent and realizes what's going on, or if you're like me and don't have perfect macro. 

I've also experimented with mech builds, i.e. some eco opening (typically 1 rax expo or rax fact expo) into bf helion with thors, but even then i find that magic box'ed mutas can destroy such an army with relative ease.

As I watched TvZ in the GSL this season, I thought a lot about creep spread. It might not come as a shock to seasoned players, but newer players may be surprised by how much a game can change due to creep. Here's a scenario that helps you understand just how important it can be. 
  
Imagine you're playing a ZvT on Daybreak. As Zerg, you want to creep spread up onto the two highgrounds, as well as across the rocks in the center. This creep not only provides vision via the creep tumors, it provides a huge movement speed bonus to all of your units. The implications of this speed bonus can not be overstated. First of all, if Terran sieges you up on the creep, your units will all close the distance faster against the Terran ranged units and thus do significantly more damage. Furthermore, you can run for a counter-attack or a surround around a flank if you have creeped two adjacent lanes.  
  
Now, as a Terran: pull an Innovation and surgically remove creep-tumors before your big pushes. This means basically 5-10 marines and a medivac on each flank, killing tumors. If Zerg doesn't split his/her army properly, you will be able to clear up 2 scan radiuses of creep, which is a huge deal and could give you 5 extra seconds of time before the baneling flank or counterattack comes in.  
  
This doesn't just apply to TvZ or ZvT though. In PvZ we often see a MSC/obs or voidray/obs combination taking out creep tumors. While you don't see Zergs doing as much ling-centric play in ZvP, creep is still fairly important. Swarmhost pushes benefit very well from creep,  by giving your spines/spores/Queens a forward position so your locusts can actually survive long enough to do damage. Also, you can't really retreat without creep, and since you play swarm-hosts sort of like Terran mech, you do NOT want to be losing your very expensive army so retreating is crucial.  
  
For ZvZ, creep is more important than it used to be, especially if you don't play muta. Creep is mostly just useful for putting your spores near the third base in ZvZ. If it's a roach vs roach kind of fight, creep gives vision and a defensive advantage, as well as a faster rally, so it's definitely useful.  
  
Overall, I'd say creep is the most influential in ZvT, so make sure you're focusing on that when you play both sides of the matchup. For the other two matchups, it's more situational and less universally awesome.    
  
In terms of how to mechanically and strategically do this, I usually go 4 queens in ZvT, so two start off as dedicated creep spreaders, then one goes to my third later on. In the other matchups, I usually only make a 3rd Queen as creep is slightly less valuable.  
  
FOr spreading them, just box them all as a group and spam c at the forward edge of the creep. Don't worry about spreading them indvidually into optimal paths unless you are Diamond+, I would say. 
  
An advanced technique: you can hotkey your tumors as something like ""0"" which most people don't use, then re-hotkey every time you set new tumors. Takes a lot of APM, but this is how Scarlett is able to spread so scarily.  
  
I hope this helps newer players understand why they should focus on spreading or denying creep.

TvT is just a experience plate. The more you play it, the better you get, so I don't really worry about that.

TvP, though. What the fuck. I thought drops were the answer, but I haven't been able to successfully drop in a very long time. And with the oracle harass, and even 3 gate harass after a quick expand, Protoss just keeps on getting to death ball and I die.

Something I thought of, as a way to deal with this yesterday night, specifically against somebody going for early cols.

1 rax, fast expand into 3 rax (2 tech 1 reactor), with quick stim and combat shields upgrades, and make a ton of marines. Then get factory ASAP and then a starport for 4 medivacs. When you have started factory, switch from marines to marauder production. Once you have 4 medivacs, take all of your guys, and all of your workers from your natural and push out.

That works, but it doesn't seem like a safe way to play.


So here is what I want to ask you guys.

1. Who is your favorite go to Pro for TvP?

2. What build do you guys do against TvP?

3. What are your general thoughts on how to deal with the late game Protoss death ball of cols, gateway units, and high templars?

4. What do you look for when scouting early on in TvP to ready yourself against mothership-core stalker harass, oracles, 3 gate pushes?

5. Have you found any timings, and with what units, do you push out at?

I know most people have moved on to starcraft 2, but we're both cheap and nostalgic.  Anyway, my question is this:  How do you compensate for Terran Battlecruisers when playing Protoss?  Honestly, I play Terran most of the time, and my friend plays Protoss consistently.  He has lost 5/5 games to me, usually due to me bringing in fully teched Battlecruisers in the late game.  The Yamato cannon allows me to pick off his air defenses from range, and I usually keep Science Ships around for mobile detection, so Arbiters aren't much help to him.  He's tried countering with:

-Carriers:  EMP'd them with Science Ship and then they retreat behind Battlecruiser wall.  Ended with decimated Carrier fleet. 

-Mixed Carriers and Corsairs; same results.

-Early rush with mixed Zealots/Dark Templars/Dragoons: Falls to my Siege Tank/Missile Turret turtling strategy.

He beats me hands down in resources and unit production every time, but in the overall battle, I win every time.  I really don't think I'm that much better at micro than he is, but it seems to be where the difference is made every time.  I guess my overall question is, how do Protoss counter Terran?  I'm more than happy to keep winning, but I'd also like to help a friend out, and maybe make our matches more interesting.

I've been sticking with Terrans in online play because I figured it'd be easier to learn the builds and the units because I'm doing the campaign also.  

I have a few main strategies I typically use.  Sometimes I focus on marines/stimpacks/medivacs and just go for a massive army as quickly as possible; sometimes I try to build up my defenses around my base and then if I win their first push I roll in and take their base; very occaisionally I harrass constantly, sending 2 or 3 reapers as soon as they train up, and sometimes this turns into a full-blown reaper assault if I can build them fast enough.  Pretty straightforward I know, but I'm still too noob-ish to come up with anything more complicated.  Hence why I'm here.

When I'm playing on vs terrans I usually do pretty well, winning probably 60-70% of my matches.  Against Zergs or Protoss I almost always get completely wrecked very quickly.

I went for a +1 Speedling expand/push that ended up getting delayed and killed by my opponent's 8-Pool into a 1-base Roach all-in.  From that point on, it was probably the sloppiest game ever with some stupid close holds and an eventual Muta-vs-Roach base race that I ended up winning.  I want to focus on the first 18 minutes(Basically up until I stabilized after he hit me with his Roach all-in) and pretty much ignore the rest, because my losing my Natural was pretty much the pivotal moment in the game IMO.

A few questions:

1) When I scout my opponent's 8-pool, I opt not to go hatch first(15 hatch); is this the correct decision to make, or should I just expand anyway and continue with my build as normal?

2) After holding his 8-pool, I expanded to my Natural.  Eventually I pushed at him with a decent amount of +1 Speedlings, but he had too many Roaches sitting on his ramp so I had to pull back.  At this point, I assumed he was trying to hide a tech-switch into Mutas (which came later) so I took my third, threw down a Roach Warren, teched to Lair, AND started researching +1 ranged attack, and much to my surprise he came at me with 23 Roaches.  What research/buildings should I have canceled/what should I have done to hold my natural expansion and maintain my economic lead?

IMO I should have cancelled +1 Range, the Roach Warren, and my third expo, and made a ton of Speedlings, as I *think* with +1 attack I might have been able to clean up the Roaches.  I had more than enough Larva due to my fairly early Macro-Hatch, I just didn't have the minerals to afford any units with that Larva.  Does that sound right?

3) What *should* I have done after holding my opponent's 8-pool?",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_12nxeg,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/12nxeg/bronze_zerg_needs_help_with_a_bizarre_game/,

1348671717.0,7,self.starcraft_strategy,10ibwk,ZvP: My thoughts on the current metagame,IsomerSC,16,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/10ibwk/zvp_my_thoughts_on_the_current_metagame/,"Hey All,  
  
People liked my ZvT thoughts yesterday, so here I go with the ZvP. Note that I am Isomer 729 Mid-masters NA. Protosses, feel free to weigh in because there are tons of things I don't know from your perspective.  
  
**Early Game: Zerg Perspective**  
In the early game, your scouting will be done by an overlord sent to his natural. Most pros are going 15P-15h or 15h-15P, depending on if they can pull off the 15 Hatchery or not. Some people might say ""you can get cannon rushed, so don't take the 15 H."" I actually don't like this line of thinking at all because of two things: Protoss are increasingly going Nexus first AND defending cannon rushes isn't that bad. Use your 2nd ovie over your 15h and you can see if he's trying anything, then just pull drones. If you can snipe the probe before he puts down a cannon, you have a significant lead because he slowed his nexus by placing a pylon. You can also send like 3 drones to attack the probe and then put 3 or 4 drones on patrol in the ""best"" cannon locations, so he can not use them.  
  
Anyway, if your ovie identifies FFE, you can take the third whenever you feel like (some people do it before 20, some wait to 35, its personal preference and not a huge deal IMO). You will drone until 6 minutes, then take two gasses, and at 7 minutes get the roach warren and evo chamber. First 100 gas to speed, and if you scout gas at the natural you can go instant Lair and +1 upgrade, but if he doesn't have gas by 7 minutes he is probably trying some sort of gateway timing so save gas for some roaches. I will talk about later 2 base allins in the midgame section, but suffice to say that roach ling will counter all Protoss allins.  
  
**Early Game: Protoss Perspective**  
The main question for Protosses is what kind of expand build to do. Many like Seed, Nony, and Sase have cute gateway expand plays where they pressure with some amount of gateway units, so if you want to try those out go check out their PvZ. The overwhelmingly popular choice in PvZ is the forge fast expand because it allows you to go worker-for-worker with Zerg until 40 or even 45 harvesters if you chronoboost well.  
  
The question of Nexus first vs. Forge first is a stylistic choice. If you want to be able to cannon rush his 15 hatchery or to be more safe against early pools, then forge first is the best choice. Nexus first has a far superior economy, however, so for that reason pros are favoring it on most maps.  
  
About wallins: Use a gateway, forge, and a pylon/zealot as your wallin. With respect to cannons, you should start with 1 and add more if you scout anything that smells of aggression (no drones at 3rd, no 3rd, your first zealot takes tower and scouts units coming in, etc.) With respect to build orders, you can do Nexus-Forge-Gateway all on 17, or you can do 13 forge 17 Nexus 17 cannon 18 gateway. The choice of build order is map and opponent specific, like if I was playing Ret I would be more likely to Nexus first, but against Moon or DRG (more likely to cheese) I would be more likely to forge first. 
  
Once you have taken your natural, the choice is this: do you take your third, pressure zerg and THEN take your third, or allin Zerg? If he is not taking his 3rd, you should not either because he is probably going muta or infestor or some wonky allin like Nydus hydra or drops. You need to get a probe or obs into his base to see what he is doing. Muta-ling you need to get storm, archons, blink, and attack upgrades. Ling-infestor you can use HT if you want to, but I would say colossus is much better against ling-infestor play.  
  
But, if he takes his 3rd, let's talk briefly about gateway plays you can do. There is the HerOic style with +1 attack and 4gate zealots that hits around 7 minutes, which is right before most zergs get roaches and thus you can try to take down the third. There is also the 6 gate which cuts probes at 32, but if you get scouted you are boned. There are later pushes like the 7gate +2 blink stalker, the same play but with an obs (safer but slower), voidray zealot (1 stargate voidray, 4-5 gateways zealots), and so on.  
  
Let's talk about the immortal sentry all-in briefly. This deserves its own paragraph because it can come in many different shapes and sizes. Does he get a warp prism? Does he go with 2-3 immortals or does he wait for 4-5? Does he ""take"" a third to lull you into security then just go? Does he get less sentries/immortals and go for blink on top of a couple of immortals/sentries? Really, there are numerous flavors of the allin. I will talk about holding them in the next Zerg section, but suffice to say for Protoss you pretty much need to land the FF and eliminate the third, at which point you can continue to allin or take your own third and go up to colossus. 
  
**Midgame: Zerg Perspective**
The great thing about these sentry allins, and what makes them so hard to deal with, is that you need to approach them tactically. You can't just a-move into a sentry allin like you can with a stalker or gateway allin because you will get 1/3 of your army forcefielded off and killed. What you have to do is sacrifice an overlord, see the lack of a third, high sentry count, immortals being chrono'd, and realize: he is doing this allin.  
  
You must not tech anymore and make only units when you identify this (or any) allin. Make lings first and roaches second. Why? Because with lings you can delay his push. One thing Protosses might do by mistake is let their army split up as it moves out, thus you might be able to run in on the sentries or immortals with a pack of 20-30 lings and either kill them or waste a ton of FF energy. Lings can usually run away because they are really hard to FF, so try to get him to burn as many as possible. From there, you just need to come with roach-ling from both sides at his army. Try to catch it when it is out in the open, not on a ramp where it can be tucked into a pocket. EZPZ  
  
After all of the 2 base shit is defended, you may now fully drone your third (you shouldn't have more than 65 drones, preferably around 60), go double evo, get infestor tech (or muta, if you want), and take your fourth. Defending an all-in allows you to tech and expand, but don't autopilot because every Zerg has been killed by follow-up allins after playing too greedily.  
  
One cute play you can use is to take his 3rd while he is backing off from an allin, which forces him to kill it off and then wait for creep. Definitely worth 300 and a drone IMO. This is highly situational, I should say, for instance if you barely hold the allin it'd be better to take your fourth with that money. If you smash the allin, then you could try this or something else equally fun. 
  

Your goal in the midgame is mostly just to get to Greater Spire and 5 bases. The more infestors, spines, and corruptors you can get out of the midgame with, the better off your late game will be. You can try roach-ling attacks into his natural/3rd at the same time, see if you can get a cancel or kill some probes or sentries, but keep in mind the main goal of the midgame should not be to kill him. Like I said, the main goal of the midgame is to set up a sick lategame.  
  
**Midgame: Protoss Perspective**  
The midgame for you will basically hinge upon whether or not you get up your third safely. With 3 bases you can make a deathball, so unless you want to win with your 2 base allin, securing your third should always be forefront in your mind. Use extra gateways to help wallin your natural or third more, split your sentry/immortal up a bit to help against multipronged aggression, but make sure you are watching the minimap like a hawk if you see he doesn't have a fourth. If you can get an obs onto his rally point or his army, that will be really great for your safety.  
  
Generally I would say the tech route for the midgame depends upon your opener. If you went blink stalkers, archon and mothership are more natural; if you went immortal-sentry, colossus first and then archon/mothership later. A lot of colossus timings exist around 15-16 minutes where your zerg opponent's greater spire is trying to pop, so keep that in mind when you play your mid-game and watch for his Hive timing.  
  
The midgame generally belongs to the Zerg, map-control wise. Some will play passively and drone/tech harder, letting you stay safe, but most will have some amount of roach-ling and will be pinning you back until you can get up the AoE to deal with it. For that reason, I would not recommend using warp prisms until you have some map presence, because Zerg is going to see the warp prisms a lot better and is going to not feel pressure from your main army.  
  
The better time to use warp prisms will be in the late game, when Zerg is spread between a lot of bases and their army is really slow. Plus, in that phase of the game you are looking to burn minerals on zealots anyways, so might as well warp them into his base.  
  
**Late Game: Zerg Perspective**  
Basically, the story here will be does he go mothership or not? If he does, most of the game will come down to whether or not he toilets you. This is why you need to get neural parasite up if you see Stargate tech going down, so that you can burn his vortex on his own units. Other than that, really just get infestor-broodlord-spine crawler as your composition. Get 5 or 6 bases if you can, and don't hesitate to make 100 spine crawlers. I'm serious: I've seen pros make obscene numbers of spines, so just get like 3 per base and a bunch at the front. Also, watch out for DT harassment, get an overseer at each base if you know he has the dark shrine.  
  
Spread creep everywhere, get lots of overseers with your army, get some corruptors if he has a bunch of colossus/VR/carrier, and you should be good. The late game is really the ""simplest"" phase of ZvP, IMO.  
  
**Late Game: Protoss Perspective**  
You are doing warp prism harass, trying not to get neuraled, and trying to toilet at least 5-6 broodlords. If you can hit that many broodlords, that will help you to win, but keep in mind vortexing a ton of corruptors/infestors or doing a double vortex are also good. I don't know much about the carrier transition, but I have seen Seed go for like 6-7 stargate carriers. Stooben in the comments mentions you should only go carriers if you are very ahead, otherwise just add gates and robos. If you do go carrier, Make sure you get storm and lots of HT if you do this style because corruptors and infestors will ruin your day without HT. Also, feel free to make mass cannons, like 10 at your front bases, because you will have a ton of minerals anyways.

I'm a diamond zerg, but I'm kinda on my way to falling into platinum. ZvP has always been my weakest matchup, although I've been having a bit of an easier time with it since I started doing the stephano build.

The problem is just when it doesn't do as much damage as I need it to. Usually I blame that on my own execution/bad scouting/whatever, but this game I felt like I pulled it off pretty ok.

I maxed out a little bit slower than 12:00, but I think that's still acceptable. My upgrades were a bit slow and I forgot to put drones in a gas geyser, but I feel like I shouldn't have come out as far behind as I did.

I have not been researching build orders or macro/micro techniques. I have however been developing a strategy that works at my current level. 

TvT is a cake walk at my level. Marines, marauders and medevac. Wait for level 2 upgrades before first attack. Usually deals enough damage to wipe out an inexperienced macro.

TvZ is a little trickier. Found that most zerg go for early rush zergling. I found that building a small Marine, hellion and bunkers holds off this first wave and allows me time to send banshees to a flank on their main. I usually have cloak before I send in the banshees. It is not devastating but it is enough to crush a players motivation. 

TvP Motherfuckers. Early stalkers then transition into blink stalker is my hardest platform at the moment. 

So far I have been teetering between ranks 8 an 9 in bronze league.

Just looking for general feedback as this match seems to epitomize my typical loss in ZvP. I went with the 12 minute max. I managed to get my natural down without being blocked. Everything else went pretty smoothly. Around the time I maxed and moved out to attack I was 20 something workers and a base up. My army looked stronger as well. Despite a really bad engagement moving through the choke we traded evenly I think. I decided to pull back and attempt to re-max while setting up to transition into festor/brood/corruptor. I don't know what the best option would have been around 17:00. I tried to destroy his third and it cost me my entire army. I was trying to get corruptors out when it happened and I had no larva/gas to reinforce with when he counter attacked.

What should I do in a situation where the 12 minute aggression has led to the protoss taking a third? It feels like I have to have a 200/200 army to feel even remotely safe.

As soon as the robo finishes I build a warp prism, load it with four zealots I've already built and fly it to their main mineral line.  With any luck, I may get a few workers before having to reload my zealots and fly away.

Or 

Forge -&gt; Cannon -&gt; Nexus -&gt; Gate -&gt; Cyber

Would it not be better to go 12 pool -&gt; hatch -&gt; Put 3 drones on gas -&gt; baneling nest. Then at 20 or so drones mas some zerglings, get some banelings and bust the cyber core?

There will be a lot of high level players there, so i need to brush up on some of my mechanics if I want to have a chance at succeeding. 

1) What are some good all-in builds for each of the three matchups? I want to have at least one cheese build for each races.

2) What is the best technique for larvae injects? By the time I get to three bases, I almost always start missing my injects pretty often, and it has cost me games where I've had definite economic advantages.

3a) In Zvt, How do you deal with a terran player who does drops very often? Whenever they do that, I seem to have no way of counterattacking, and can't do anything but defend.

3b) Going along with the theme of 3a, one of the biggest problems I have with dealing with drop harass is splitting up my army. I will take a group of units from my first control group, and send them off to defend. But then, when my opponent does an simultaneous attack with his main army, I'll select my army control group to defend, and accidentally include the units that I wanted to defend, leaving the harass do wreak havoc on my base. How can I stop this from happening? 

4) In ZvZ, how do you transition off of a ling/bane opening? Whenever I open with some minor ling/bane aggression/harass, I end up not being able to switch into roach/muta tech very easily.

EDIT: 

5)ZVZ: How do you beat muta play? Oftentimes, i realize that its coming, and am able to get the necessary spore crawlers down. But then they just contain me, and get the economic advantage. What is the correct response to this?

6) ZvT: Is it safer to just open up with an earlyish roach warren, since opening with hellions is very meta-game right now? It might cost to fall slightly behind on workers, but then I could secure a quicker third than I normally do.

By getting Dark Templar onto the field, you force down detection. If your opponent has none, you simply win. By playing with this style you’ll simply beat every player that skips detection. The nice thing about forcing down detection is that cannons can’t move, and so your opponent needs a Robotics Facility if they plan to take their Natural, or leave their base at all. A Roboics Facility and an Observer costs 175 Vespene. A player with a Robo really needs two Observers however in order to move out of their base (detection in base and on army), raising the total cost in vespene to 250 Vespene for detection alone. This is the cost of your Dark Shrine!

If a player already planned on getting a Robotics Facility, then they’ll like construct units that attack from their Robo. This means you now have an army advantage in the mid-game due to Chargelot/Archon’s ability to trade very cost-efficiently (with proper engagements), and can take a faster expansion than your opponent.


Overview
It’s been a while since I last released a guide! I’m so sorry, huge lack of free time in college &gt;.&lt; I want to post up something I was pretty passionate about trying about a month ago, and since then I just haven’t had any time to work on it further. So before it gets lost, I’d like to share this idea with the community in hopes people can try out some interesting PvP strategies based off of this post.

I stole the idea for this type of play from iSTime one day on ladder. So I meet him on ladder and start asking about MLG, then realize I had gotten an Assimilator before my Gateway, or something stupid like that. Long story short, he killed me with a single really fast Archon (from DT tech), and a slew of chargelots!

And so I stole the idea. DT into Chargelot Archon. I’ve played this style against some of the highest NA players (GoSuGatored, iSMentalist, various GM Protoss) and it seems a solid and different way to play. Here’s a good point as pointed out by GomJabbar:

GomJabbar wrote:
DTs force (and are weakest against) robo tech. Chargelots and archons are quite good against robo tech in the early and mid game. So it’s a pretty effective transition.

Choose your Opening
As I do with most of my threads lately, I include a Choose your Opening section. The same goes for this style, and since this is a style rather than set in stone instructions, it can be done in many different ways. I’ve done 1 Gate FE, 2 Gate 3 Stalker -&gt; FE, 3 Stalker -&gt; 1 base, etc.

I recommend going with a 3 Stalker opening, as it’s just an extremely solid mid-game opening.


Mid-Game
I define mid-game as the portion of time after the 6 minute mark when any 4 Gate attempt is either tried or feigned. As this time passes, it is best for you to be faking a 4 Gate if you can. Place a couple Pylons at your enemy’s ramp, and run your triple Stalkers over for early game support. As your last pylon is killed start warping things in so they are cancelled, then immediately place your Dark Shrine. Your opponent isn’t going to attack you at this point, unless you let them realize something is off or they are just plain bad.

Take this time to get out your DT tech. This is also the time to be researching Charge (while Dark Shrine is constructing), and making a lot of Zealots. Keep your early game Stalkers out on the field and active, as to deny towers/kill wandering probes. You should aim for having Charge finish shortly after DT tech is finished. Once DT tech is finished you should be able to afford a couple DT. You should more than likely try to get one in your opponent’s mineral line. Try to lure the enemy obs away and sneak it in. The rest of your DT you warp in should be immediately made into Archons.

Once your first Archon is constructed you can try to bust your opponent’s ramp. The best thing to stop this timing attack is just a Pylon + 2 Gateways on your opponents ramp. If these buildings are there, you should just back down and expand.

If he has a Robotics facility, then Immortals are going to suck, and the same goes for Colossus (only have one at this point in time). There’s a fair chance that if you bust the ramp cleanly you’ll kill your opponent at this point in a very one-sided battle (you need a proxy pylon to reinforce!). Be aware however that this is indeed a risk if the opponent does have Sentries, as it can be really difficult to get an Archon to run over a FF when Chargelots are swarming around.

Often times on close positions mid game, the opponent will go for a 1 base Colossus allin. Just be sure to engage down the ramp and away from any mineral lines, and you should be able to come out on top due to cost-efficiency. I have a replay that exemplifies this wonderfully, where I was down from the early game about 700 resources, and still won a battle due to a smart DT in a mineral line and proper engagement.

A Chargelot/Archon composition in the mid-game will also auto-win against any Stargate opening. I have a replay that exemplifies this against some GM protoss on I believe Xel’Naga Caverns.

I almost every game will transition into an expansion + Blink followed by a Robotics Facility. You can usually take a very fast expansion after the first Archon due to an ability to win battles with cost-efficiency in an open engagement.

Nexus Timing
When exactly do you expand? You can place your Nexus in trade of 4 Zealots at any point in time. This can be when your Dark Shrine is constructing and your Stalkers are mid-field. I do this pretty often, though you have to know if your opponent is likely to allin or not (an allin hitting before charge/DT will likely kill you). Times when you can do this are when you are ahead, had a very convincing fake 4 Gate, your fake 4 Gate actually set your opponent’s build off and he made mistakes, your opponent simply doesn’t move until he has an Observer out (which means your first DT should wreak havoc!).

Often times I place my Nexus after I realize I can’t bust the ramp and kill my opponent. It’s usually pretty clear as to whether or not I can bust up the ramp. If he has his army on the top of the ramp and has a few Sentries, you probably can’t kill him unless you have a very early and well timed first Archon + Charge. If he skipped the Sentries and is rushing for Colo, or something else, you can probably win with a timing attack.

So to reiterate, you can place your Nexus after your first Archon in trade for 4 Zealots. Don’t do this if you see an allin from your opponent billowing across the map (think 2 Colossus or some sort of Immortal allin).

Weak Spots
There is definitely a weak spot in this style, and that is the time before Charge finishes. If you are playing a really bad player, the chances of him arbitrarily attacking you are higher than normal. So take this into consideration! Against a more keen opponent you can be active with your early game Stalkers, and have a very good chance that your opponent won’t know what’s going on with your Zealot stockpile until it’s all too late.

Trying to bust the ramp at different times with Archons has lead to quite a few losses on my end. You can definitely do it, especially in lower leagues, but it’s really hard to kill a player busting up their ramp unless you have a good amount of experience doing so, or do it really well. You have to have your Archon bust the FF’s, you have to spread your Zealots against Colossi splash, you have to prevent your opponent from abusing your Zealots’ short range. Just know that it’s much easier to wait for your opponent to move down their ramp and engage mid-map, than to aggressively walk up their ramp.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not an incredible Starcraft player yet, I am still pushing through gold and working on my macro, watching my replays etc etc.

I was playing with the Evolution Chamber script for Zerg builds and my idea was to find a way to put early pressure onto an opponent that would hopefully cause him to build defenses and panic a little. While he is building army and bunkers/cannons/spines and is expecting more lings or banelings, you are dropping a second hatch, getting +1 Carapace and getting 12 roaches to push his front.

The build goes like this:

* 8  SpawningPool
* 8  Extractor
* 10  Overlord
* 10  Zergling x3

Push with lings and try to cause economic damage without losing any. If they wall in just contain and push their ramp every 15 seconds or so to remind them that you are there. Lings also serve as the scouts, so if you can get one inside and hiding, that would be a great idea.

* 15  Queen
* 18  Overlord
* 18  RoachWarren
* 18  EvolutionChamber
* Get 3 drones in gas
* 18  Extractor number 2
* 24  Overlord
* 24  Carapace
* 24  Roach x1
* 26  Overlord
* 27  Roach x1
* 29  Overlord
* MOVE DRONE TO EXPO
* 29  Hatchery
* 28  Roach x4
* 36  Queen 
* 38  Roach x1
* Get 2 more drones in gas
* 40 Overlord
* 40 Roach x5
* Fill gas
* Push
* Extractor's 3 and 4 when you see fit.

Depending on how the push goes, either start pushing your economy or reinforcing with 6+ roaches at a time.

You have to be aware of invisible units or Air, but you already have your Evo Chamber. Dropping a sporecrawler during your push and then teching to lair immediately after has helped me.

So far I have used this build in 2v2 with my Zerg friend, when we both do the exact same build it looks like a 6 pool so the opponents usually panic. Then at 8 minutes we push in with 24 Roaches. It is a pretty devastating build. Not to mention that it helps hold the opponents cheese, using it in 2v2 has worked out well.

Also, does anyone know when the +1 spit upgrade would be a better choice? I was thinking against Protoss because the roaches can take so many hits from Stalkers before dying, but without speed it seems like they would just micro away.

I know this is probably an overdone question but here it goes.

So this guy pauses the game, I wait a minute and unpause, he calls me a bastard and proceeds to cannon rush me.

I spot the probe with my second overlord and send a drone to chase it away, by that point it's already got a pylon and 2 cannons starting to build. I manage to kill the probe but he just sends another one. 

Consider this the starting point, assuming I'm not going to patrol a drone outside my ramp just in case this happens and the earliest I could have spotted it is when I do (if having 2 drones not mining before 3 mins is an acceptable tradeoff please let me know too.) The cannons are done before I have zerglings out and pulling all my drones wouldn't have stopped it. I can't prevent him placing more cannons on the high-ground, as that area is already protected by the low-ground cannons. Obviously I tried zerglings and eventually banelings to try and break out but this was a bad idea.

I don't think spinecrawlers would have been a huge help since they wouldn't be able to reach the ramp/highground. Sure they might stop him placing cannons any closer, but then I'd still be trapped inside my base. How do I break out after that point if I successfully stop the cannons from creeping forward any more? How do I not lose my expansion while I'm contained once he eventually starts warping in gateway units to kill it?

**Zerg:**


The swarm host seems really... tricky. I think tank armies will really hate this one. Could work like a lurker, depending on how exactly the swarming ability works.

The vipers ""grant detection"" line makes me think it can make certain units see invisible units, rather than making them detectors like overseers. This would make micro pretty interesting, though it is a pretty big paradigm shift so maybe not that likely. The dark swarm 2.0 spell is huge ofc but with fungal this seems almost too good. Maybe infestors are gonna get the knife in favour of this? A shredder disables when friendly units are inside its range, so the viper can pull in anything of the enemies and disable its attack. Maybe changelings also trigger the cancelling effect? Oh and it has a meathook ability too. Not sure I see that as being too important, unless it is aoe (the text is unclear about that).


**Terran:**


Warhound seems like a thor replacement - the thors always been pretty boring and its activated ability has bounced between overpowered and useless since launch. A smaller unit is also automatically less abusable with repair, since it's harder to keep lower HP units alive. Seems like blizzard really want to have PvT and TvT move towards mech again.  

Battle Hellion: Hellion was too hard to prevent damage from, so I guess Blizzard made a more army oriented version which would be easier to defend when its harassing but be more useful in armies and against marines in particular. TvT bio counter -&gt; TvT moves towards mech again.
Shredder: If it didn't say it is a unit, I would guess it is a replacement for the ravens heatseeker and autoturret abilities. With a burrowed carrier for Zerg, mobile detection is going to be a must for TvZ and that means the raven is batter up. Thus, it would have to do something more than just detect.

**Protoss:**

Replicator: wtf. I have a hard time seeing how this either wont be infinitely abusable or completely useless. Maybe it will just be powerful but then also a must for Protoss?

Oracle: A Potoss overseer, it seems like. Clunky harassment and acceptable scouting all in one. Could be pretty hilariously effective against mass mule harvesting though.

Tempest: Light air targets, eh? Phoenix, Mutas and... interceptors? banshees? I suppose it could be anti-viking which would make sense, since you would use it to keep colossus alive.

And the other was combat-ex, you may not like him, but I don't think there are many bold enough to say he's not good. 

Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzw3IBu1ci8

So how should Toss go about dealing with BroodLord/Infestor? I'm going to try to keep myself from complaining about how messed up it is that the race with cheap units/hatchery gets the most efficient late game army, and just focus on how Protoss should deal with this situation. 

CombatEx recommends completely avoiding the BroodLord Infestor Army, and using the fact that Broodlord Infestor is slow to wipe the enemy's bases before he can wipe yours. Essentially, just do a base trade as fast as you can. You should be able to wipe all of his bases before he can wipe all of yours. 

Day 9 doesn't really give direct advice (at least in the video I referenced) but I get the strong impression that he recommends using drops, and following essentially the same principal as CombatEx. Combat the near invincible, but slow BL/Infestor army with some kind of high speed harass. 

In the legendary Stephano vs KiwiKaki game, KiwiKaki appeared to be shooting for an Archon toilet (I thought that this tactic was made invalid by a recent patch, but apparently its still effective?) to combat BL/Infestor. There was never really a large battle with a clear victory there though, as they didn't do more than kiss and move with each other till the very end, perhaps because Stephano was trying to avoid getting his army flushed. 

What I want to know is:

1. Is there a way to effectively combat infestor broodlord at cost? If not, what's the closest you get as Protoss? When you have to directly engage, what army composition gives you the best possibility of an even trade? Are CombatEx and Day9 right? Is Broodlord/Infestor too strong to combat at cost?

2. What other tactics should be employed against BroodLord/Infestor? How else do you deal with them? What strategies do you use that take advantage of the slow speed of BL/Infestor?

3. What are your thoughts about having to employ indirect means of combating a BL/Infestor army? Is it always possible? Is it too easy for zerg to Spore/Spine up? Should Protoss be going for all ins whenever we think that Zerg is about to get BL/Infestor?

We are both at very similar skill levels, when he plays standard our games are generally back and forth and long.

**General Overview:** The build opens with either 2gate 1forge, or 1gate 1forge 1gate.  Your scouting probe drops a pylon behind the natural mineral line, adding a cannon when the pylon finishes.  If you are opening the 2gate 1forge, the extra zealot arrives to block the zerglings from killing the pylon or cannon.  If opening 1gate 1forge 1gate, the cannon might get denied, but it will force lings and delay the expansion.  Once this opening phase is complete, you fast expand, and transition into a blink stalker timing, I believe with +2.

**How it feels as Zerg:** The opening pylon-cannon doesn't always get up, but it can surprise you if you don't scout it and cause a lot of havoc, at the very least you have to pull drones to deal with it until your lings come out.  Once the attack is over, I go into super drone mode, but even then the protoss is barely behind on workers.  The blink stalker push is incredibly powerful if you aren't prepared for it, and even knowing it's coming, it's very hard to deny.  The only time I successfully held it off was with Roach/Hydra, but the followup colossus transition killed me.

**Attempted Responses:** I tried a number of different builds.  I have traditionally gone ling/festor in the early to midgame in ZvP, so I did that for a while, but the blink stalker timing hit just before the infestors came out, and even with spines, was able to do enough damage to kill me.  I tried going for an immediate roach counter-attack after getting my natural secured, but this also got mopped up by the stalkers without doing enough damage.  I tried a fast roach/hydra, which held off the blink stalkers, but left me behind in econ and the colossus followup killed me.  I tried ling/baneling, but I didn't actually get to see it against the blink stalkers, but I think they would have been out in time.

**Things I didn't try:** I didn't try fast mutas, because blink stalkers do too well against them.  I didn't try roach/ling or hydra/infestor, both seemed too weak.

**Replays:** I uploaded 3 of my most recent games

Testbug - http://replayfu.com/r/w75Qcn - I don't exactly remember what I tried in this game, I know I built lings in the early game to keep a scout up and kill rocks.

Dual Sight - http://replayfu.com/r/DPdqG - I believe that in this game I went for the fast roach counter attack.

Daybreak - http://replayfu.com/r/wKhzXg - In this game I did the somewhat successful roach/hydra.  My transition into corruptors wasn't as fast as it could have been, but the looming threat of the huge stalker ball held me off from saturating my third, which led me to be behind on econ.

Personally it is something I have never tried but in a way it makes a certain amount of sense, though there are plenty of hazards to a muta-oriented style.

For starters, infestors. I am sure that each of us have played in a team game with zergs on both sides. One gets infestors the other gets mutas and before you know it the entire ball of mutas evaporates due to a chain fungal?

Solution: Spread mutalisks just like we already spread them against thors. Even with such a short range we can still cluster a fair amount of mutas together to attack a target without clumping to the point of losing everything.

Hydralisks would be the next problem, but honestly they are a bit of a non-issue. Slow units off creep (and denying creep spread and overlords with mutas is easy), light unit subtype, and always take 3 hits to kill a zergling (at equal upgrades). In short, hydralisks are bad (but the only dedicated GtA we have...).

Roaches would be a problem as a roach timing attack would be difficult to hold without roaches of your own, but once you have a fair number of mutas out the mutas + lings/spines should do well enough against roaches. As Day9 says, the best way to stop your opponent from doing cute (and mutalisks are pretty cute...) is to just go kill them. I think this would be the most serious problem.

*So I’m writing this as I am currently bored at work and have been meaning to do so for some time. I am a Master League Terran who has recently been playing a lot less SC2 but has been around since day one of the beta. At my peak, I was in the top 1000 of players and although I am a good player, I am far from where I want to be. I am writing this to share my thoughts on mech which is generally thought of as a weak playstyle although from what I hear (I don’t watch the professional SC2 scene much; I am an avid watcher of BW though) more pros are using it. I have found that many people dislike going mech in SC2 even though it is very effective and I hope this write-up may convince others to try it out and experience a different way to play the Terran race. I mech almost %100 of the time but lately have been experimenting with bio/ bio-mech against zerg as the bigger maps have made it harder to consistently win against zerg with pure mech. 

**AGAINST PROTOSS:**

*Mech is amazing in this matchup once it gets started. Tanks melt stalkers and help against colossi, while hellions just melt the speedlots that people get to counter tanks. Immortals are hard to mass and ghosts can easily render them useless. Even the mass amount of hellions help against immortals as the flame attacks reduce the immortal shield quickly enough for tanks to shell against immortals. 
 
*The mindset against Protoss as Mech Terran is to match Toss expansions and get pretty quick upgrades to fight well in the late game. This however does not mean to just let toss get what he wants and as many bases as he wants as toss is pretty unstoppable late-game with the number of units that can be produced by warp gates. Instead, going for a 2 base or even 3 base push is nice but sometimes toss can have more units at those stages of the game because of how their race works. Because of the defensive capabilities of the units you are producing and the fact that toss will try to poke or attack your base head-on, if you come up on top (which normally happens), you then go for a counter-attack with your mech units or advance your position to deny reinforcements to a toss expo which you can then deny with blue flame hellions. 

*Common Builds: I always go for a wall at my choke because of the annoyingly effective builds that toss has. I then go for a factory after rax and make a siege tank while producing rines in order to combat most openings. Usually the zealot and stalker that toss tends to send to my base gets there when I have ~5 rines and my tank is about to finish. Depending on what I see in the toss base, I then continue tank production but I plop down a CC in base which is extremely safe. You must always make sure that there are no pylons in your base/keep alert to be able to repair the wall which keeps your tanks safe/send constant scouts or scan the toss base to prepare against 3 gate robo or 4 gate. The metagame nowadays (the faster expansion by toss) allows you to siege expand more safely however. 
*(One trick that is useful in “guessing” what the toss will do is sending an scv scout to see what type of units the toss has. Generally, a sentry or two means a lot slower tech so you can cross off void rays or the rare DT strats as 200 gas that early generally means more gates/planned expansion. Likewise if a toss only has zealots and just one stalker at the ramp, I build an engr bay just in case and more often than not, a void ray or sometimes a DT comes only to turn away because of turrets.)
*After securing my second base and the two extra gases, I generally get an armory and another factory, or depending on how greedy economically the toss is being, I go for a fast timing push. 
*My favorite timing push with two bases is either [1 tech lab factories + 3 reactor factories to pump out hellions in a staggering amount] or [2 tech lab factories + 2 reactor factories to have a higher tank count]. The latter is a bit of a slower push but is less risky as you can transition back and try to turtle your way back into the game when your push fails. The former is a very fast push which usually hits when the first colossus comes out and allows you to set up a contain, destroy the nat expansions, or even just end the game. (Sorry that I do not have specific minute times but I am on my work laptop) These two pushes are very effective as colossi are generally the only toss unit that can handle large numbers of hellions and without them, hellions can melt zealots, act as meat shields for tanks against stalkers, and most importantly, decimate probe counts. 
*However, my favorite way to play this matchup is to get early upgrades, defend my expansions with tanks and then try to get a third as quickly as possible as well. (It helps to make turrets as you advance on the map to make the toss blind and generally making them in-base to conceal the amount of factories you have helps as well so that you do not get pushed to death by toss) Then I can comfortably put down a bunch of reactor factories in order to push out with a comfortable tank count. If the opponent has made a bunch of immortals, I generally make some ghosts as well even though, as I explained before, hellions help tremendously against immortals. If the push happens later or the toss rushed to colossi, I have one reactored starport making Vikings as well. The beauty of mech is that your tanks generally don’t die and do heavy far range dps and the 3-4 reactored factories you have constantly replenish hellion (meat shield) numbers. Also because of how fast hellions move, you can send a few to the toss expansions to erase probes. 
*If you get to the very late game, it’s handy to have a few starports that are reactored to emergency pump out Vikings in case the toss switches to voidrays or carriers after they realize that attacking a well upgraded terran mech army with their ground army is like running into a wall of lava (blue flame hellions, tank shells). However I generally advise that you end the game before this point or severely cripple the toss economy so that he can’t get to a critical mass of void rays or carriers as without well upgraded rines (which you won’t have), even I find it hard to beat the toss player after holding more of the map and resources. 
*Mech against toss has a bunch of vulnerable-timings but once you get hellion production going and an even number of bases, you hold the advantage and can easily decimate a toss army to go onto to destroying his bases as well. It is also the matchup which is decided by how the battles go as the number of tanks you are able to save with each battle will allow you to keep pushing while reinforcing with hellions which are produced quickly. REMEMBER TO UPGRADE


**AGAINST TERRAN:**

*The mindset in mech TvT is to draw lines in the map to ‘hold’ with tanks so that you can expand and deny enemy expansions. Although I am only in Masters, I excel at this matchup and have been able to beat GM terrans. It is my favorite matchup to play (not only because it’s my highest winrate matchup).

*Back in the beta people used to do almost pure Tank Viking. People started to experiment however because a lot believed that TV was too immobile and in some cases, too hard. That is why marauders began to be implemented and then when marines were made to counter marauders, the metagame changed into the marine/tank/other air unit composition that is now popular. However, I have still found success in usually primarily tanks and less Vikings. The reason is that as long as you can hold the positions, tanks still kill basically anything on ground, and Vikings kill anything in the air. Air dominance in a Viking/tank fight or even playing against marine/tank/Viking is important so I generally go for faster air upgrades than ground as once you lose your Viking count, it is hard to catch up again and your opponent can hold more ground/advance towards you.

*Another good unit composition is tank hellion as long as he has a low tank count and high marine count. Hellions are even faster than marines and when position-microed right, hellions can help tanks melt through rines faster. Then, you can engulf his tanks with your hellions and then use your tanks to kill his. 

*Build/ Openers: Generally I use the same opener I use in toss with the siege expand and all but I either get a fast starport after or if I sense that he’s getting banshees, I get a turret and get the range upgrade. You might ask why I don’t just get my Vikings earlier but I have found that banshees can make you waste scan pretty well at higher levels of play even when they don’t do damage and the ranged turrets bring the effectiveness of the enemy banshees down to 0%. In fact, in almost all of the games that the terran goes banshees against my siege expand, I have such a huge eco advantage that I know I’ve won the game. You have to be careful of blue-flame hellion drops however. They come later than banshees but with the siege expand, you may only have a couple of tanks by the time it gets there. What I like to do is make a bit more turrets and have a tank seiged close to each CC. Even then I lose some SCVs but because of 2 Orbital CCs, unless I lose a substantial amount, I can kill his dropped hellions and bring myself back to a higher economic state faster with mules.

We're not total newbs, but still low enough on the totem poll that most of our in-game ""issues"" get brushed off as ""oh you just need to macro more."" While I am still in silver, I'd like to spend some time helping out the people in my league as much as possible with advice that is more apt for our particular, current situation. So, some thoughts after my session tonight. 

Upgrades. This is largely directed at zerg and protoss who are facing a terran opponent. You should absolutely expect that when a terran pushes out (especially if it's the typical 10 minute timing or beyond) that he will AT LEAST have stim, shields and— more often than not— 1/1. You NEED to expect this and plan accordingly. Even if your forces greatly outnumber his, he will easily tear your army apart if you don't at least have +1 armor. 

Timing. Do not let your opponent sit unharassed for 20 minutes straight unless you plan on getting steam rolled. I see this a lot with toss who think their ""death ball"" will protect them from all evil. At least camp his base with a few units, do a warp in/drop or run in some lings. We're silver...most of us have a hard time dealing with and rebounding from harass. 

Tonight I had a toss hole up on two bases for 22 minutes while I casually picked up 4 bases and maxed out on ghosts vikings and marauders. He let me drop his base twice before adding any static defense and then complained that terran was a click to win race. I normally get destroyed by late games toss especially if they antagonize me throughout the game. The game is more or less balanced, but you have to gather intel and you have to pressure your opponent. 

Last thought is on expanding. Yesterday I talked about adding production, but you also need to start learning how to move to three bases. I don't know if it's the same for the other races, but for terran, if you're running a 10 minute timing push, you should expand as you push out. If my opponent hasn't expanded to 3 by the 12-14 minute mark, I know that I have around a 90% chance of winning. You need to keep up economically. 

So, TLDR; Expect terran to push out with upgrades, and react accordingly with your own. Don't leave your opponent untouched for 20+ minutes. Learn how to expand to three bases. 

Good night all and glhf out there.

Just wanted to talk about the major flaw I see in other players with most of the matches that I've been playing. Using this to my advantage is what allowed me to move from the bottom to the top of silver league almost over night. 

Production. Production. Production. After graduating from bronze, most players start to focus on improving their macro. The contrast between bronze macro and silver macro is night and day. The problem that most silvers have in their play is that they fail to realize that macro isn't just about producing workers, it's about ADDING ON EXTRA PRODUCTION AT THE RIGHT TIME. Generally for terran this is around the ten minute mark when you're pushing out and taking your third. At the ten minute mark I throw down 3 extra barracks. At the 12 minute mark, I throw down 3 extra facts or SPs (or just more barracks :). I'm not for sure if my particular build order is exactly ""correct,"" but I do know that in the end, I end up with way more stuff and the ability to remax my army a lot quicker than my opponent. 

This is what happens most games. At 10-11 minutes, I move out with my main army and we either meet in the middle or I camp his base. We trade blows back and forth, often times with me barely holding on as my units have to make it all the way across the map to reinforce. Many times, my main army will get wiped and he'll start to push my parade back, but it doesn't matter, because while he was focused on only producing more units to maintain the upper hand in the fight, I was busy adding on 7 more production buildings. By the time I've taken my forth and my extra production buildings are ready to go, I re-max out almost effortlessly with a stronger, more varied unit comp based on the fighting that I've just done, and I completely overwhelm my opponent. 

So, TLDR: The moral of the story is that macro isn't just about producing workers, it's also largely about production. I feel like this is the missing element on most of the silvers and golds that I play against.

After losing my first couple matches to zerg this evening, I decided, what the hell, I'll give it a try. I'm a high silver player, and one of the things I struggle with the most is early game harassment and scouting. I open most games with a reaper scout, but he really isn't enough to put a ton of pressure on...just an intel gatherer. I win a fair amount of my games, but most of the time I'm so focused on my macro that the other aspects of my game slip. 

As you can imagine, this build opens with EXCELLENT harass. Hellions take map control away from early speedlings— keeping him holed up— while banshees terrorize the queens and mineral line, forcing him to go more into static defense. Zerg plays reactive anyways, but you'll definitely be forcing him into anti-air units right from the start. Terran's strength is in their ability to heavily influence how their opponent must react to their strat.

Basically at the end, max out and a-move. Enough thors+SCVs handle mutas and your hellions (blue flame) + banshees tear up ground forces. Very effective comp.

My question is— since I tend to go bio most matches— how effective do you guys believe this same comp would be against the other races?

They also managed to pick off a lot of scvs early I think should build missile turrets sooner against protoss and a bit later against Terran because of medivacs.

TvT http://drop.sc/330562

In this one, I won.  He wasn't too happy but looking through it, I noticed that we were around even.  I did change up my normal build for this one and it didn't feel right at all.  Looking through the replay, I was not getting the income that I was used to.  The first attack was very messy on my part.  I tried to split my units before but when the attack came, my units clumped together which made my opponent's tanks more effective.  His tanks moving in to my bio was lucky for me.  If that hadn't happened, my next move would have been to drop all those units in his main.  The win didn't feel satisfying.  

TvP http://drop.sc/330561

So here, as I went through the replay, I realized that he knew what I was doing most of the time.  The engagements didn't seem too bad, it's just that I didn't have enough compared to his.  I think one of my mistakes was that I let him get that large death ball with the lack of harassment.  

TvZ http://drop.sc/330558

In this one, the engagements were pretty bad.  I did have one good drop but that's it.  The lack of aggression did not help and his blings had very good connections.  I've noticed that I have an extremely hard time taking down Zergs whenever there are ultras.  

I would really appreciate any feedback for any of these replays!

Here's my original post:

&gt;I've been streaming all of my games to make it easier on myself when looking back and trying to figure out things I could have done better. I've been playing multiplayer for 2-3 months now and while I have come far from where I started, I still have a long way to go. My main build is a raxFE but I sometimes just mix it up and try to do something else. Also, I've been watching filtersc's series since starting which has been a great help. Last season, I was doing very well, but since starting this season, all I've been doing is losing.
&gt;
&gt;At this point, I realize that I pick poor times to engage and I've become a lot less aggressive. Replays show a lot of poor decision making too. I'm pretty frustrated and desperate and that's not helping one bit.
&gt;
&gt;It would be awesome if I could get some tips from other players on what I could improve.
&gt;
&gt;**Major things I'm trying to work on:**
&gt;
&gt;-high pressure and aggression
&gt;
&gt;-splitting against blings/tanks
&gt;
&gt;-countering attacks/units
&gt;
&gt;**Some other game play analysis:**
&gt;
&gt;-I often turtle and keep my units in one tight ball. Selecting all combat units and a-moving doesn't help that either.
&gt;

That said, I started pondering a way to make Terran a little more evenly matched against the other races in the late game, as many would agree and Blizzard has even stated that Terran is an early game race while Zerg and Protoss excel in the late game.

It has been mentioned in other threads that Terran should have the ability to drop in Barracks units like they can in the campaign, and while I can't recall how it was received by everyone else I can say with some certainty that the way unit drop in works in single player would never work for ladder and tourneys. Feel free to tweak or outright refute anything I say. This is merely a concept and I am by no means trying to claim that it is necessary or a game balancer.

Protoss and Zerg have strong methods of reinforcing their armies as well as responding to attacks on their bases while the army is away. Protoss has warp gates and chrono boost while Zerg has creep combined with the immense production power of inject larva. Terran, however, is a little behind in this regard, as the only real method for boosting their army production speed is through reactors. The thing about inject larva and chrono boost is that these both can increase economy as well as army production, while the only similar ability that Terran has is MULEs. I am not saying that this isn't fair on the economy side, as MULEs are widely regarded as fucking amazing, but reactors simply don't cut it when it comes to army. With creep, Zergs can pump most of their units quickly into the fray, excluding slower units such as Infestors. Protoss can immediately enhance their army in the field through proxy pylons. Terran units are stuck with the only option being a steady and slow trot into the fray and by the time they reach the army, the battle is already over or almost over. This is where drop pods come in.

My first concern was that drop pods would break the game. The idea of dropping units from the sky onto opponents is pretty worrisome when it comes to balance. I have a few fixes to this. First off, Terran is already doing well in the early game, so the drop pods cannot be usable here. This makes it necessary that drop pods can only come AFTER Starport. I was thinking either a Rax+Tech Lab research requiring Starport, a Starport+Tech Lab research, or an entirely separate building (or possibly Ghost Academy research) that once again requires Starport. This places it late enough where the only way to get it early is to make some serious sacrifices. Secondly, scanning and dropping has to be out of the question. Simply disabling drop pods where a scan is present amends this issue. Thirdly, the drop pod cannot simply function like warp gate. The purpose of drop pods is threefold; Reinforce, Defend and Recover. Either bolster the army, defend a drop/nydus, or make up some of your lost supply after a battle went south. Considering this, I would think that making a separate building that launches the drop pods would be the best way to deal with this. On a very long cooldown, this building would be able to launch 2 marines or 1 marauder per Barracks with an addon on for their normal resource cost. Example: Terran has 10 Barracks, each with an addon. Disregarding addon type, he can elect to drop 20 marines or 10 marauders (or a mix) for 1000 minerals (+25 gas per Marauder). The cooldown could be somewhere around 2-3 minutes per pod and the research would require 2 minutes and cost 150/100.

Ive tryed the mass hellion banshee opening from Polt, which seems to be good, unless they know whats coming :P So i wanted a build a little safer.

So this is a basic 10 minute timing, which can hit really hard if but also gives you a fast 3rd at home. I wont have medivacs at 10 minutes, but ill start making them at that point. I just came up with it, so its obvioulsy not perfected, but i really like the idea. It gives you map vision with the hellions in early game and sets you up for a strong midgame.

The idea with going hellions instead of marines is that the marines are mainly there so kill the zealots in the protoss army. Since marauders does a much better job killing the other protoss units. So instead of marines i use hellions in this. They do splash aswell meaning theyll do a lot of damage.

This build requires some micro to be perfect. I didnt execute it like i wanted, cause in the early game you can try and poke up the protoss ramp with 4 or more hellions and see if you can pick off sentries. If you can you might just set you up for a kill at 10 minutes :D

I think the key to great mechanics is an efficient macro cycle.

I'll start by explaining what I'm currently trying to incorporate and hopefully others can chime in and we can make it better or re work it.

So the base of mine comes from day 9's mechanics daily, specifically the map-tap-cap part.  Do most of you use something similar? Basically whenever you get the chance, you check the minimap, check your production, check your money/cap.

I've further refined mine and gave myself some physical cues, so in detail:

1. double tap f- double tap army while looking at the minimap
2. tap w,e - CCs and upgrades on w, army production on e
3. tap s,d,f - taping my army hotkeys but it's just to make a physical reminder to look at money, gas, cap
4.  double tap f,d,s - goes to the location of my main army units, but I am looking at the minimap.  really helpful to keep track of drops/scouts and gets me looking back on the minimap.

Anyway I try to do this cycle whenever possible, basically after every army movement or building placement.  I've done a lot of tinkering with this in the past and so far it's the best I've come up with.  The biggest problem I'm having is actually using it all the time.

Lately I have been in somewhat of a rut in the TvZ matchup. I don't know whether it's just me, or the overall metagame, but I get 2 base allins in 8/10 matches against zergs. Not like pressure, like 2 base roach-sling-bling 8 minute busts. Almost every game.

In the other matchups, when I lose, it is usually obvious as to why. TvZ has just become a gamble of whether or not I will be allind or not and preparing blindly for allins means that I will lose the macro game, but not preparing means I will lose to the allin.

I play standard, 1 rax FE into reactor hellion. But if I make even 1 round of hellions I just die to roaches. I have tried going 1 rax FE straight into tanks, which stops allins, but I can't put any pressure til about 10 minutes in with a marine tank push. This is bad, because he can easily go up to 4 base, start working on higher tech, and STILL hold a 10 min marine tank push if he plays right, or I make a mistake.

When I watch GMs play almost all of them go 1 rax FE every matchup, every game (which is what I do), but it really feels as though going reactor hellion before expand in TvZ is necessary because it's fucking impossible to scout zerg allins.

I could really use some TvZ tips on scan timings, opponent 3rd timings and gas timings that would be useful to know to deduce the type of allin (or lack thereof) that is coming. Also any nifty builds or transitions would be welcome.

My thoughts are that you are expanding in the direction you are pushing. The push from your third to their third is made easier by this forward base, you deny their natural 4th with the alternate 4th being in the drop path you would take to their main for harassment and scouting tech, your reinforcement path covers your natural. (and assuming you are holding the tower, which DeMusliM isn't doing, you would see anything coming and could react) You have high ground advantage rather than low ground disadvantage....

It might be easier to pull you apart with a fast ling muta force though. I'm not sure. In the game on stream he loses his natural to a ling bling muta force but sits at the top of his ramp till he has enough to push out again.

The idea is that you proxy the 20 hatch, inside the Protoss main. If the hatch goes unscouted you win, because, obviously, you have a hatchery in his main. If it does get scouted, you cancel it, and bust their front with roaches just as you would do, if the expansion were in your natural. Should they build cannons next to the building hatch, their front will be weak, and the cannons won't help defend the front of his wall.

This is along the lines of what I'm looking for.

I know that because I play random, this may be a bit harder to answer, but basically my problem in 1v1s has always been expansion timing.  Now, recently I've gotten much better at establishing my naturals via just forcing myself to early(ish) expand - for example 15hatch on Tal'darim, 1 gate expand for Toss, tworax expand for Terran... so that's all well and good.

However, all these FE games are causing me some trouble because I always really struggle to take my third, so I get ahead on macro but then don't maintain an advantage.  In particular, in maps with destructible rocks, I seem to have a hard time knowing when to pull my army to kill them (the rocks, but maybe also the enemy) vs. scouting and so on.

I guess what I'm hoping for is some good general advice about how and when to take third bases while still leaving oneself in a decent defensive position.  Advice for any of the nine specific matchups is great, but overall philosophy would be even better.

This is something I am working very hard on, but any tips to improve are more than welcome.

Game 1. TvP. Shakuras http://drop.sc/88901

Scouting- I saw 1 Gate, 1 Core, 2 Gas, and high energy on his Nexus. Is this too early for 2 gas? I considered this pretty standard, assuming he would chrono out warp tech and then go into 3 gate robo or 4 gate. I got my SCV out before 4:20 which I think is about the time a Stalker pops out.

The bunker on my ramp was unnecessary, but I love opening 1 Rax FE against Toss, and wanted the bunker just in case he 4 gated or something and I had to deal with early pressure.

10 minutes- I didnt mean to get a tank, and getting siege was a bigger mistake, the tech lab was supposed to be for my raven.

16 min- My drop got scouted by his proxy pylon and easily shut it down (I could have handled it better too)

20 min- First big engagement, I thought after his early DTs I should have slaughtered him here. I didnt, it was close. Was this micro on my part? Should I have stimmed forward and taken out the Colos first?

I also had idle SCVs in my main at the end. Somehow I failed to notice this...sorry.

Overall, not a terrible performance on my part. I definitely think after his opening I should have won by a larger margin, but thats why I'm here :D

Game 2. TvZ. Antiga http://drop.sc/89000

Okay, I made a lot of mistakes in this one, but TvZ is probably my worst match up regardless.

6 minutes- his scouting lings picked off an SCV, not a huge deal (I dont think) but I should have saved it.

I think I should have put down a factory sooner for faster tanks and medivacs

I totally missed his early expo in the 6 o'clock. No excuses there.

12 min- pretty terrible engagement on my part. I dont know why I didnt split my bio for the banelings, but did some okay damage to the workers in his natural.

16 min- I have no clue why I went to engage, I knew he had a lot of lings and banelings, would it have been better the wait behind my wall for him to try and bust?

Stayed on 2 base for WAY too long. When Zergs go muta,ling,bling I have a terrible habit of getting contained. Any ways to prevent this? I just think I cant move my rines out of my natural because of muta harrass or banelings at my front.

I also didnt add on Barrack for a rediculously long time, and even had one in progress the entire game. This is pretty uncharacteristic of my play, but turned out to be a major factor in this loss.

22 min engagement- thought I handled this relatively well. Feedback please.

23 min engagement- pretty awful on my part.

31 minutes- I got up his ramp into his natural, but i think I wasted the opportunity. Should I have stimmed and targeted the banelings while they were morphing? Or something else entirely?

Overall I played pretty shitty in this game. I think not expanding and not adding on rax really killed me. I did decently with upgrades, denying muta harras, and micro (overall? maybe? lol). However, I think if they Zerg was of a higher caliber he could have expanded way more aggressively and would have absolutely crushed me.

That's all for now. Thanks for your time and help! :D

It doesn't even seem like I'm being that cost effective. Against this particular Zerg it seems like I could never be as drop heavy as I wanted to be.

I've known about this build for a while now and have just recently begun using it again. I find that recently every zerg and their mother is going for all sort of crazy all-in's (and if not that, muta) against forge FE openings. 

I've played 4 matches with this build since I started to use it again. Won 3, lost 1 due to poor macro on my behalf. 

I find myself really enjoying this build for a few reasons. The first is that it is pretty easy to fend off mutalisks early on. phoenix + mothership (mothership hits at around the time 2 base phoenix would) means that the mutas just get wrecked if they try to attack. If they decide to go mass muta than vortex + archons demolish them. 

The second reason is that it sets you up perfectly for that late game composition you so badly want in PvZ. The fact is the mothership is quickly becoming a must have in late game PvZ. Mothership/archon is one of the few ways you can realistically deal with brood lords and the build crushes a lot of other common unit compositions as well.

Finally I like that it is not dependent on a forge FE and is still a quite economical build. 

The biggest problem you run into is muta/ling/bling. This just requires you use your vortex defensively a lot of times rather than try a toilet, because if you try than your entire army just gets decimated by banes :p. 

So has anyone else used this build before? For those who are having troubles with the match up or who are simply tired of having to go 2 base timings you should check the build out.

I think that the ability to measure progess is key so I can know if I am improving and get excited about the improvements I do make.

As context, I understand that void ray nerfs happened at least partly because potential counters did not have enough of an advantage; that is, it took too many marines to defeat one void ray.

This strategy (I've been trying to submit a link for this but it hasn't shown up on reddit) involves a 10-12 min push off of one base that includes 14-16 SCVs, a couple banshees, 2 medivacs, 3-4 marauders, and the rest marines.  You can use siege tanks instead of banshees and their purpose is the same in that they target fire sentries to prevent GS and force fields.

The only things that I lose to are DTs and sometimes an early stalker push with one void ray.

I have continued to refine this strategy and tighten the timings.  The push in the video below is late.  I almost never push after 11 mins with this now.

The reason why that timing exists is it is before colossus is out for most.  The critical mass of 3 colossus is what makes terran infantry useless and you have to kill him with this prior to that.  Also psi storm owns this so you can't go late.

I typically do early game harasses vs Zerg: blueflame, mass helion, banshee, 2 rax / 3 rax marine marauder pushes, reaper stuff, you name it. But all that stuff is kind of flimsy: it lacks the ability to kill your opponent, just to inflict some econ damage or force some extra units. As well, you don't typically stay with those harass units as a central composition (other than 2 rax / bf), and have to transition out, which takes some time.. 

I have ""discovered"" a nice push that I like that isn't flimsy and isn't necessary to transition out of (like the others), as it is basically an early siege timing. Thought I'd share it: http://www.sc-replay.com/replay/04-08-11/155184-Feel-VS-RicheyRich.html?justUp=1. 

Don't mind the stuff after the attack happens (as I've pretty clearly won after that): the push is quite muscular (a combat siege timing with 1-2 medivacs), and it is pretty eco-friendly (CC goes down at 7:30 ish). One may point out that he did get supply blocked/had just made a round of drones, but he did get 22 lings out before the engagement. As well, I could have easily plopped down some bunkers to strengthen the push: as it stands, I killed 17 workers and a bunch of lings and gave myself a significant advantage going into the mid-game.

Blue-flame helion harass is really deadly and more than equalizes the economy despite my 3rd being earlier.  Vikings are better than Goliaths at dealing with carriers, too; they're not restricted to the ground, so it's hard to micro against them.  And Terrans have thors, which in large numbers can focus fire Carriers and do ok damage.  I've also tried going for 3+ robos making immortals constantly, but that's just not good enough either.  Lots of helions, landed vikings, a few marines, thor strike cannon, it can all do ok against Immortal hardened shields.

I had 4 Hatchery and I knew he had at least 2 bases. So I decided, let's attack and see if he goes back to defend (he didn't). 

@ http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/guide/gameplay-overview it says:
&gt;In multiplayer matches, you win the game when you’ve wiped all your enemy’s buildings off the map or if the other players surrender to you. 

Knowing that now, I should have saved some minerals to build extra hatcheries since Protoss / Terran can build a Supply Depot or Pylon.

I just do the whole queued move with my probe and I can usually keep my probe alive till an offensive unit is made.  I'm not the best with times that I should scout after the first probe and I don't really pay a whole lot of attention to the clock/timer.  It's probably a bad thing but the only time I really check it for a timing mark is between 6-7 minutes.  I realize build orders play a semi big role into what you have out when so let's see if we can get anything.

PvZ - Usually a FFE.  My probe usually scouts the pool/hatch timing.  I actually do a pylon+2 canon behind their natural or block their natural with a pylon if I have the resources and depending on what he puts down first.  After the first probe I usually make a couple of zealots and push them across to see if he's taken a 3rd, take the towers, and maybe just see what's at his front door but I can never see what he's teching too.  The last few games I've been against zerg I have done a usual 7 gate + robo and warped in a ton of guys in his main to find an ultra den.  If I hadn't attacked when I did it would have been WAY to late and the 2-3 that I saw do it could have had ultras to destroy me.  I don't know what timing mark this is, same with mutas or hydras.

PvT - I'm still in the stone age and don't do a gateway FE.  I need to work on my Terran but right now I do a fast gas for moco, warpgate, and stalkers to start and then roll into HT's.  As for scouting though, first probe can usually see if he's going 3 rax or 1/1/1.  After the initial scout with the probe I'll send over the moco to poke the front and see what guys he has made and if I can maybe see other buildings but usually only see marines and the front wall.  Any timed marks I should try and scout over there to see what he's building?  Help if I know he's going tanks, mines, air?

PvP - Hate this match up so much.  I usually go 3 gate robo or 4 gate still and have been losing to VR's a lot lately so that needs to be changed.  I kind of know the timings for toss since I play them the most.  I just hate this match up.

**PvT**: Sentry/Stalker 6:00 rush and expand, if fail, 8 gate mass Chargelot/Archon push. 

**PvP**: 3 gate Blink Stalker rush and expand, if fail, DT/Immortal drops until gg

**PvZ**: I played only 2010/2011, so I don't even really know how to FFE. I dont really have problems with 6 pools so far.. provided I survive the 6 pool, I go sentry/immortal into chargelot/immortal.

If I see a spire, I mass phoenix and take out all their overlords and queens to attempt to force a gg.

My problem with Toss is their lack of AA. Specifically against 2 units, corruptors and void rays. So now I want to switch to Terran.

**TvP**: Mass bio. Not much marines, mostly marauder/ghosts w/ medivacs.

**TvT**: Marine/Tank/Banshee, keep doing drops/Banshee harass until Battlecruisers

Would this work?

I used to have at least a 30%-ish win rate against zerg a while back (which was the highest I'd ever gotten it), but then I took a break and now I can't make it work anymore. Only games I really win is against all-ining zergs who gg when their 6 pool drone all-in fails to take down my wall. SC2 thinks my current MMR is gold or thereabouts (I win virtually all of my TvT and TvPs, so I guess if I figure out TvZ I'll be back in platinum).

My perceived problems are as follows:

* I have 0 map control. From the moment I dare peak outside of my natural, zerg knows it, and adds like 60 additional supply in the time it takes to walk over and attack. Needless to say, I lose my entire army and it's game over. Same goes with drops. Overlords, just everywhere guarantee they all land in a pile of banelings.
* I don't know how to take a third vs zerg. vT and vP I just get it at like 10 minutes, but they don't have zerglings.
* I have no game plan. I really only know how to play macro games, which is out of the picture when I can't secure a third. Two base economies confuse the fuck out of me.
* I can't seem to find a composition that works in any part of the game. I wish this was just me complaining about broodlords, but I'm losing my shit to being overrun by T1 units.

Is there any up-to-date guide to a TvZ playstyle that works, like post-queen buff? Because ignoring the race and treaing it like the other matchups and focusing on macro clearly does not have a lot of success (especially when you can't expand :-( ).

To clarify, I'm not looking for a build order as much as I'm looking to understand how to think in TvZ.",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,race-t,True,t3_zljrh,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/zljrh/tvz_loss/,

My partner plays toss.  We used to get lots of wins against - well, everything - using a build/strategy I made which relied mainly on siege tanks.  That's kind of irrelevant now, because we just always get out macroed to the point where I just can't keep up with anything that's going on.  We've been on a losing streak like 10 games long just as we thought we would get promoted to silver (was matched up against plat &amp; gold, somehow won).  I know how to counter almost any unit or build (at least that I encounter in bronze, which, to be fair, there's only like 5 generic builds people use =P) but we still lose.  My huge issue isn't macro like scv's or making units or upgrading; I do all that fine for the most part.  My problem is I can never expand.  No matter what I do, my expos get shot down before I can do anything.  I don't have the resources working on one base to suppress the enemy forces or anything.  If I try to defend multiple bases at once, I'm spread too thin to do anything against a signifigant force.  Basically, my issue is the enemy will get the ball rolling before I'm able, and then be able to outmacro me into submission to take more bases.  I'm stuck on one, maybe two if the natural is easily defended.  If I'm lucky, I can get a fast expand, but 95% of the time I'm facing zerg they 6 pool, so that blows that plan to hell.  One more thing:  I almost always end up with way too many minerals to use with not enough gas.  I would go for the ""macro the shit out of marines"" approach, but they always have things that counter them because bio balls are really the only terran build people use in bronze.  So now I'm stuck with 2k minerals, no gas and facing colossus/roaches/brood lords/whatever.  Obviously my partner is in the same boat or else I wouldn't be in it myself.  I know my macro is garbage or else I wouldn't be in bronze, but I could do signifigantly better if I knew how to expand without getting a pole up my ass.  I need much help.

Last week, I analyzed 10+ replays from Starcraft Strategy and posted them on my Youtube. You can find the [Protoss](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL54AFB467A6CC6454&amp;feature=plcp) and [Terran](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC94FBB314B9AF905&amp;feature=plcp) play lists of games that I casted.  
  
For the second Casting Clinic, I decided to mix things up a bit. Instead of casting on my own from replays, I want to pit members of the Starcraft 2 Strategy subreddit against each other in epic battles! My idea is the following:  
  
I want a pair of players from each league to put on a Best of 3. Because there are 6 leagues (B, S, G, P, D, M), this will allow me to do every single matchup (ZvX, TvT, PvP, TvP).  
  
I will then cast the games while they are playing! I will also be able to interview each player and talk about their mistakes and areas for improvement, so you get more of their perspective.  
  
The games will be played Sunday, July 29th, starting at 6pm Eastern US time (3pm Pacific). I imagine this will probably run until midnight or so - players will only be responsible for being available for about an hour. 
  
If you are interested in participating in these show matches, please respond to this post with your race, league, and a link to either this website (http://sc2ranks.com/us/484494/Isomer) or some other source which shows me your league/wins/etc.  
  
Will post an official update to this if people want to do it and I then work everything out. OP will deliver.  
  
Edit1: **I NEED MORE LOWER LEAGUE PLAYERS!**  
Edit2: Okay I am going to make this a first come, first served thing so I know what I have and what else I need. Have 5 players so far - need 12 total! Here are the matchups so far.

His constant Feedback's on Illusion's Medivac's, while not truly necessary by the point of the game he was doing it, had me thinking.  If you see a Terran going standard MMM in PvT, instead of thinking 'should I go HT or Colossi?' shouldn't we just head for HT?

Each HT you warp in hard counters a Medivac he produced, *immediately and without Storm researched.* 

If I'm way off base here somehow, please tell me, but as far as I'm aware Protoss players have been almost entirely neglecting Feedback and it's use.  Even at a pro level, you'll rarely see more than 3/4 Feedback's in the event you actually catch a game where they happen.

Lastly, let me say that *yes, I know it uses precious energy that could be saved for Storm*.  However I feel that it's a point that people *know*, but aren't actually *aware* of, if you understand what I'm saying.  Your average player would say 'yeah, I can Feedback Medivac's' but probably wouldn't, just because they never think to.

I don't know, I didn't get much sleep, it's not even 6 AM here, and the thought of simply hard-countering a unit like that simply blew my mind.

Is the 100 gas really too much to spare, especially when you already have a decent amount of barracks down?

Off the top of my head, here are some of the advantages I can think of that having double starport earlier in the game would give you:

TvP- You can use starport #2 on a reactor to be able to always stay ahead of the colossus count, even when playing vs. double robo. Your medivac count can be replenished much faster if you end up losing a lot of them to Stalkers (especially blink Stalkers). If you're not having trouble with your Medivacs or Vikings, you could keep the second Starport on tech lab and have Banshee harass all game long, although Templar and Stalkers are pretty good against that. If you can keep your Starport on a tech lab, you'll also have a Raven against to help snipe Observers.

TvZ: Again on the reactor, you can replenish your Medivacs quickly if you lose a bunch to Mutas/Corruptors or fungals, or get a bunch of Vikings out quickly to try and deal with Brood Lords and Corruptors. I think having your 2nd Starport on the tech lab has much more potential in this matchup however. If you go for an opening like Virus did last night in the GSL with the early tank and siege mode to defend, your Zerg oppponent can make 5-6 queens like DRG did and you end up with creep at your front door in record time. Having a Raven would save so much money in scans to clear out all of the creep spread. I also feel like Ravens are somewhat underrated against Zerg air units as they tend to end up clumped (especially Corruptors and Mutas). Seeker missile does quite a bit of damage, and if you catch the Zerg player without his units split, it can even be a GG scenario. You can also keep Banshees out by having your Starport on the tech lab to try and deny Zerg's 4th/5th bases.
tl;dr Why do I almost never see anyone add on second Starport until super late game, and do you think this is something Terran players should take a look at doing more often? If anything sounds off please call me out as I don't play Starcraft so I don't have game experience to go off of.

Just recently I got a job and I'm building a new gaming PC, so I can't wait to get back to SC2!

I remember Parting for a few PvZ games he dominated a few months ago, but I didn't know he had become so awesome until this week when I checked out a few GSL games from this season, and the recent Day9 Daily about his PvT style.  I'm super intrigued by this!  I want to know everything I can about it.

It seems to me like he goes for the greediest FE he can get away with given his scouting, makes as few units as possible while powering probes and gateways, and then his build diverges at the 8 minute mark (approx.).  The day9 daily showed off his 7 gate timing attack/all in, which transitions into a contain while he mass expands and techs up.  Looks strong but I used to try stuff like that and it was hit and miss (and pretty all-in).  In the GSL, I've seen him do a really fast 3rd base at 6-7 minute mark much more often, where he masses gates and gets charge and archons and makes a ton of use out of sentries in the midgame.  Then he just defends 2-base Terran and keeps preventing a 3rd base, while expanding more.  Looks brilliant, but I'm sure there's lots of weaknesses.  Finally, I see him sometimes get a robo before his 3rd base or his timing attack, and sometimes not.  I assume this has to do with scouting or lack thereof.  Also, sometimes he gets a cannon at his natural or a fast forge - what's up with that?  And the first game vs Polt, he was actually down in bases for a long time and didn't attack nor take a fast 3rd while Polt went for the super standard 10-minute timing attack while taking his 3rd - why did Parting play this game that way?

Anyone know about more details to this build? What are the scouting triggers for his divergence in the build? (when does he do the timing attack vs fast 3rd? When does he get his robo and what does he use it for in different circumstances?  What does he do vs mech stuff, 2 base marine tank contains, 2 base cloak, etc?)

Also what are some good vods to study up on this build/style?

I have about 7 replays which I think are about average games I play. I'm gold btw.

In ZvT I typically have 2 problems. Either I can't take a third base because of hellions and marines or late game ZvT I find myself running out of bases with minerals and having to expand closer to terran. I'm guessing this is because I'm not getting more efficient units like brood lords out. However I find that the games that I have tried getting brood lords I've had a lot of problems with drops because of how slow they are or I find loads of minerals but not enough gas to get a lot of them.

ZvP I've mostly had trouble right after I take a third base I get pushed by toss with a lot of units and can never hold my third with Roach/Infestor. Other problems I have are dealing with stargate plays in FFE with them killing off my overlords and queens until I can get infestors out to deal with them better.

ZvZ I just have a hard time telling when to make a baneling nest, when to get a roach warren or expand or get lair. Usually I either find myself winning once I get infestors and roaches out while taking a third base or getting killed early by a lot of roaches while I only have ling/bling.

Thx for any help.

I'm currently a high silver Zerg and I think I'm getting better with my macro/mechanics...

I've been trying to execute the Stephano ZvP to nearly a 100% win rate against Toss, but recently I've run into a bit of trouble.

In most games I max out and attack as my opponent is taking his 3rd. I find that this is when he is off his balance and has a weaker force. Recently, however, when I attack with my maxed out army his third is nearly up and he has a strong army with collosi in it.

This army comp is much more difficult to beat even at ~13 minutes...

first off I'm wondering, how can my Toss opponents manage to get a third while having a strong army with collosi at ~13 minutes? What can I do to delay his 3rd/ get a better attack going with my maxed out roach ball? Is there something I can do to make a more effective push?

Once, we were playing TZ vs ZZ, and the two Zergs we were playing against starting trash talking as soon as the game started, so we *knew* we were gonna get cheesed. They both 6-pooled, and completely overran us.

The shitty thing is, we knew *exactly* what was coming, and I'm not sure there was any way we could have defended it. We only had one Terran working on getting our wall up, and the ramp was extra big due to it being a 2v2 map. When the zerglings arrived, there was no way my Terran partner could have had any attacking units out, so he was auto-fucked. That essentially left me in a 1v2. I had 8-pooled, and just made zerglings, which weren't enough.

In retrospect, I would have fared a lot better if I made a few spine crawlers instead of zerglings. That would have given me a pretty good shot at defending my base. However, I would still have to deal with *two* opponents, and my partner would definitely die.

I am very much a creature of habit, so when I first forced myself to start using hotkeys back in bronze, I picked a set I liked and just stuck to it, hoping it would sink in.  It was flexible depending on the situation, but in general it was something like this: 1.) main army 2.) important depots to raise/lower 3.) vikings, hellions, or other random unit subset 4.) CCs 5.) tanks, ghosts or other random unit subset 6.) factories 7.) rax 8.) blank (used to be second set of rax before I realized you could make marines and marauders with one hotkey without tabbing) 9.) reactor starports 0.) tech lab starports (again, didnt realize that I could do this without tabbing).

It was less than ideal, but I had gotten used to it and was reluctant to switch.  Finally though, I was getting to the point in my play where I wanted more hotkeys.  I wanted to try doing upgrade buildings on hotkeys, I wanted to have split marines and more extensive subsets of units, and I was running out of number keys to use (what if I'm facing bling/muta/blord and need 3 or 4 hotkeys for all my unit types?)  The conclusion I reached was that I needed to consolidate my unit producing structures.

I had the same worry everyone else does when they switch hotkeys: ""What if it gets worse before it gets better?  What if I blow my ladder ranking while I adjust?""  But I pushed that aside, and I took the plunge, opting for a few single player games to get used to the feel of the new scheme I had chosen.  I had been right; it DID get worse before it got better.  The single player games and first couple ladder games I tried were hectic and flustered, I felt like I was focused just on hotkeys, and it was frustrating.  However....it got better.  Lots better.  The new scheme keeps the main army on 1 and the CCs on 4, but everything else is changed.  For ease of reach I mostly phased out 7-0 except in cases of drops and other random subsets you don't attend to much (I haven't had as much occasion for these yet).  2 and 3 are my unit subsets like tanks, hellions, vikings etc. (with higher numbers always available in matchups where I use more unit types) but 5 and 6 saw the most radical changes.  5 is all non-CC unit producing structures, and 6 is all upgrade buildings.  

The big muscle memory adjustment was creating new ""pathways"" (neurologically speaking) for tabbing to different structures.  It took some time, but now that I'm accustomed to it....holy hell.  I could never go back.  It helps my macro a great deal; the more I get used to it, the easier I find it to spend my minerals (and not with queuing).

Again, this is not meant as some great strategy insight or ""wow run out and do this immediately"" post, I just wanted to share something that worked for me and suggest to others that if you ever feel your hotkey use is awkward or lacking, at least this individual player found it helpful to experiment with something more efficient.  Mostly I was just excited and wanted to share.

With this in mind, does anyone have any other hotkey recommendations?  I haven't really used screen-position hotkeys, do others find those helpful at all?

Just theory-crafting here, but it seems like there's a lot of synergy between the two. 

* Generally most attacks are ling+muta, because the mutas are gas heavy and so excess minerals get dumped into lings.
* When the mutas go in to hit the probe line, Zerg now has vision of the main base for a nydus attack.  
* When attempting a normal nydus, it can be easily denied by a few marines or just pulling scvs to attack before it pops.  However, with mutas in the base, they can protect the nydus to buy it some building time.
* Against T, the lings will get free reign on the scv's and turrets aren't a problem.
* Throw in a few banes to guard the ramp, and the lings can really tear it up.
* If T or P decide to push to counter, the lings can just run back into the nydus and pop out on the other side to defend the counter.

I'm just wondering why we don't see this at the pro level more often? Or if anyone here has had any success with this strategy?

How do I tell *what* the zerg is going to do with their spire? Several times now I have scouted an early spire, with little tech surrounding it, and figured that it was fairly obvious they would try for mutalisk. So I get some phoenix out, get +1 air, ect. Typical ""muta counters"".

Then I get hit by some sort of mass roach timing or a lot of roach/corruptor. (Or in this recent game roach/hydra/corruptor). Even if I hold it off I am on the back foot all game and never really get to recover.

So anyways, how do I tell? What are ""signs"" that they are going for mutas? I feel like it's almost impossible early on to tell and most of my PvZ games, as a result, feel like a coin flip. It's not that I have a problem with mutas or *any* kind of zerg composition... it's that I have a problem knowing *which* composition it is going to be.

The biggest issue I have is that I cannot just ""wait"" until I see mutas. If I see mutas and I am not prepared it's an instant loss. However if I prepare and mutalisks don't come than it is also almost an instant loss for me.

Do I just try and do a different mutalisk counter other than genius's +1 build? I'm not really sure. Phoenix are what I am the most comfortable with vs. Mutalisk but I essentially need to be clairvoyant to tell what the zerg is doing ahead of time.

It's really just making me want to try and just 2 base all in so I don't have to play a guessing game. And that sucks because I'm a heavy macro player :/.

I usually open 3gate expo, with sentries, get 4th gate and forge when nexus is up (As suggested in Minigun's PvZ guide). I then get hallucination to scout and tech appropriately according to what I see Zerg doing. My macro is pretty good, regularly reach 60-80 probes in a game.

My problem comes after my expo finishes. Zergs crush me with 2base roach/ling, mass roach, roach/hydra or roach/muta (often this is a 3base push), whilst taking a 3rd and 4th base.

I cannot get enough units out to hold the pressure, or safely expand. My tech choices are usually spot on, and sometimes I've even been ahead in upgrades. I just cannot mass enough units to survive the initial pressure, or in the rare case that I barely hold the zerg remaxs and crushes me a few minutes later.

Any tips on how to survive heavy pressure plays like this would be appreciated.",,False,,t5_2smn2,False,,,True,t3_mvdme,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/mvdme/need_pvz_advice_on_holding_pressure_eu_gold/,

The three for me:

* Xel Naga Caverns: Small map, and it's hard to secure the gold base while preventing Terran from doing the same.
* Antiga Shipyard: quite easy for T and P to secure a third base.
* Shattered Temple: ugh. If T or P blocks my natural (with a pylon or ebay), it puts me way behind, and I hate having to go to the next base to put up a 2nd hatch if I'm delayed too much. Also the terrain behind the minerals... I've lost to many a drop in that cramped space.

My biggest macro errors that I think stand out are not making enough production, floating way too much gas and on occasion minerals, and perhaps just forgetting workers after my expansion. I'm not even getting supply blocked, just making so many errors I think.

1320511486.0,5,self.starcraft_strategy,m1i3c,[P][High Bronze] Looking for some advice and tips on where I went wrong!  (Replay link inside),Tsa579,7,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft_strategy/comments/m1i3c/phigh_bronze_looking_for_some_advice_and_tips_on/,"Hello reddit!  I used to play SC2 quite often when it was released, but stopped for a few months.  I didn't pick it back up again until some of my friends bought the game.  I haven't been ranked in the last few seasons, but the one I did play in I was bronze and winning almost all of my games.  The replay is against a very hard AI (I have a little bit of ladder worry).

My own analysis of my replay:

Macro wasn't too poor most of the time, minerals and gas only broke 1k mark once or twice.

Scouting needs improvement, more observers at potential base locations would have helped immensely

Need to be more aggressive

After losing almost all sentries and stalkers I shouldn't have attacked with just a few zealots and a bunch of collossi as it was wasteful

Drops were pretty terribly done

A third would've been a good idea after repelling the first attack on my natural.

Two robotics facilities were not needed so early, I saw the large amount of roaches and panicked.

Should have built more stalkers or maybe even some phoenix to kill off corrupters (I knew they would be coming out but didn't do it for some reason)

Turrets should have gone up at natural expansion sooner than they did

I'm a low level player so I'm sure I missed other stuff, but the sidebar said I should post what I think I should have done differently so I did!  Here's the replay: http://www.sc2replayed.com/replay-videos/15053

Hope I did that right ^ .

Today is the first time I sat down and laddered for any extended amounts of time during Season 4. Despite what my name suggests, I don't tend to cheese, ever. Well today I split my games basically 50/50, the only problem was that I lost every. single. game. versus terran.

It's been 2 weeks but suddenly every terran is doing a pre lair timing w/o tanks. Its heavy hellions combined with bio or just more faggoty hellions and it is doing just tons of damage. I Usually do 2 base muta with a spine and 3'rd queen for hellions, but terran finally figured out that they can bring other shit to mess you up instead of simply containing.

So while i figure out how to hold this off and take a third at the same time, why don't the reddit zergs list their favorite zvt cheese. give build orders, map preferences and what you look for while doing it etc. This way when i get frustrated waiting for hots to balance some shit out, I can revert to cheese until I calm down.
