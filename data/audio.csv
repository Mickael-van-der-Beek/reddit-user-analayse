I was wondering weather it makes sense to buy studio monitors over conventional PC speakers when the budget is very constrained, say £200.

For instance, I could get Creative Gigaworks T40 series II for just about £90. Or, I could invest those £200 on two yellow (yes, they absolutely need to be yellow) Fostex PM0.4n speakers plus an external DAC (I have a laptop). Will the extra investment be noticeable? Furthermore, in this particular case, the T40 series has better frequency range on paper (starting at 50Hz compared to 60Hz of the PM0.4s). Can I simply deduce then that base will be better on the T40 or are there more aspects to it (more of a rhetorical question I guess, but care to elaborate)?

To put this into some context: I want to get new speakers for my home office, I use a laptop connected to other peripherals, and will be mostly listening to downtempto and lounge music, occasionally watch a movie or play a game. I would like to get best audio quality possible within the budget. Yellow colour is a plus!

My grandfather passed away Friday, and it was discovered today that my aunt had accidentally recorded a conversation with him last week that really embodied who he was as a person. The trouble is, there's a ton of background noise we'd like to remove. I manged to extract the recording as a .wav from her iphone, but now I need some help in where to go next.

I can dabble in MATLAb and try to remove some noise that way. But I was hoping someone here would have a better (preferably free) program I should try using, and some pointers on how to begin my quest.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and if you have any tips I am eternally grateful. 

I am truly sorry if this post offends anyone, but I am hoping for a reddit miracle. 

edit: Thank you whoever upvoted. I appreciate you helping me get seen even if you don't have an answer.

I've been playing with audacity, and a noise gate filter. The problem I'm having is that he is talking at about the same level as the TV it seems. I can clearly hear him though, so I'm holding out hope that I can find a wizard here who can help me.

&gt;You're looking at the audio the wrong way. You should be looking at SAMPLE RATES not BIT RATES. 128kbps means it is CD quality. Almost all humans cannot tell the difference between 128 and anything higher. What humans perceive as sound quality is the SAMPLE RATE, or how much information is given per frequency (Hz). The bit rates are only for computers and how much data they process per second. Besides, CD players don't even use bit rates
My copy is 44,100Hz @ 128kbps. The other copies are 32,000Hz @ 192kbps.

I'm a bit confused. I thought that higher file size (320kb/s MP3) means better quality than a smaller one (128kb/s); is that not the case? Is this comment full of facts or fallacies?

I was wondering if you guys could give me any suggestions for certain brands and models of speakers and stereo receivers. I have a $5000 budget to work with.

**What I think I need:** 

*  A stereo receiver capable of playing at least 2 different sources at the same time, and can handle 10-14 decent speakers. 

*  10-14 speakers that will perform well when turned to 11 to drown out the machinery noise. I'm thinking 6 for the large main area, and 2-4 each for two other smaller rooms. Speakers must also be water resistant as the area gets very steamy on a nightly basis. 

*  Airplay or something similar would be a cool feature.

Any input is greatly appreciated!

The sound quality doesn't need to be great and ease of setup would be key. Does anyone have any ideas for what might work in this situation?

I've ripped most of his collection to MP3.  I've purchased a number of used 900MHz speakers to place all throughout his house so he can enjoy his music all day with no intervention, because his 5-disc changer is now too complicated for him to operate.

I need an MP3 playing gadget that meets the following criteria:

* does not require me to build or hack it much or at all, I want to buy something, load it with properly tagged media, and go
* does not require him to remember a startup sequence, such as loading an app on a tablet or something; it needs to start with the controls visible if it has a screen
* large screen or buttons with **simple interface and large type** - needs basically a giant ""play"" button, and a giant ""pause/stop"" button, and everything else to be small/ignorable/hidable by configuration. ""Next album"" button would be a really big bonus.
* Displaying MP3 thumbnails would be wonderful.
* has a ""shuffle by album"" mode, **very** important, he will be unhappy if it shuffles by song because it is classical music
* will retain all settings through power loss or shutoff
* can hold at least 8GB and preferably up to 32GB on whatever media it uses, preferably solid state
* will survive being dropped
* has some kind of a dock or cradle so it stays still when he pokes at it
* **does not** run exclusively on batteries!!! Can be connected to AC power.
* can be connected to other gear by RCA cables, be it direct out or 3.5mm-to-RCA or whatever.

I will connect it via RCA to the 900MHz transmitter, and then the speakers will play the music throughout his house.  I am remote so probably a friend will do this and he won't have someone in the house every day to help him if it is unstable, so it needs to be pretty bulletproof.

Use case: he gets out of bed, pushes play, bounces around his house all day listening, hits pause, goes to bed.

Please, no comments on audio quality. The man cannot hear above 6KHz, I don't care that most 900MHz speakers top out at 15KHz and don't have much bass. (Sorry, I just got flak for that when I asked in a forum with less helpful folks.)

Thanks!

*Edit:* I suppose I could have it shuffle by album 24/7 and he could also just turn on speakers in whatever rooms he wants to hear music in, too.

Of course, you can always fall back to the crappy flash player we'll bundle with if you just want to go that route.

The system will be most similar to SubSonic, but will be written in Python+Angular+jQuery+Bootstrap. Since the controls and the playing will be separated by the network, we should be able to ""send"" audio anywhere. This framework also allows for multiple users at the same time controlling different players.

We're also looking at a building a plugin system that will allow you to connect the system to things like Last.FM, bittorrent sites, AllMusic, etc. That's where the real power of this framework will come in handy.

This will all be based off open-source code and libraries, so the sky really is the limit. What do you guys want to see?

I'm setting up my bedroom A/V system and can't figure out the best way to ""complete the circuit."" 

Before I try to describe what I'm missing, here's a schematic showing you: http://i.imgur.com/aDJDCiW.png

Basically, I have analog audio coming out of one source, and digital audio coming out of another, and I want a way to route them both into the same [single-RCA-input amplifier](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049P6OTI/ref=oh_details_o02_s02_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

The ideal solution would be a 2-way source selector with an RCA stereo input and an optical input, a built-in DAC for the digital signal, and an analog stereo out. I haven't been able to find something like that online, but if there's some feasible DIY alternative, I'd certainly be willing to give it a shot.

I understand that I could have an independent DAC and a separate source selector, but I'm trying to minimize the number of components in a probably unnecessary effort to have a bare minimum system.

Have any of you encountered a situation like this, or have any information on how I could solve my issue?

We use a lot of lapel (/lavalier) mics for conference audio, and one of the challenges is to position the mic so it is clear of hair, jewellery, and clothing. Otherwise I find it results in an unpleasant rustling sound. We usually use Shure WL-185 capsules (http://www.musiciansbuy.com/mmMBCOM/Images/shure_wl185.jpg) - I am aware that there are much smaller capsules by Countryman and AKG, but that's what my employer has.

I notice on TV productions, the presenters appear to have lapel mics on their chests under their clothing. Can't see anything on the ear like a discrete headset, we're talking shows like cooking shows and the like where I can't imagine the producers are going to the trouble to conceal mics on the hairline.

If this is the case, with under the clothes micing, how do the sound techs avoid the rustling? Or is there another trick I'm missing? Would be good to be able to know, so sometimes I can hide mics under the clothing - make for a smoother slicker look for the corporate shows that use IMAG, avoid a bulky mic.

I'm looking for a AV-receiver with Airplay support. I also need multiroom support for 5 rooms/zones. (I can reduce it to 4, or 3) 

I want to play different music in each room, but i has to be able to select airplay as source for the zones. 

Does any of this exists? I know Denon, Pioneer and Marantz have multizone and airplay support, but they only support 3 zones. And I don't know if they can play music from airplay in separate zones simultaneously. Does anyone have experience with these devices? 

Maybe I can set up a few airport express's to support the other zones, but only if there are no other options. 

Rooms are: 
*Living room
*Kitchen
*Office
*Bathroom 1
*Bathroom 2

What do I need or what do you suggest?

My first thought was that it had to do with the files themselves, but I am pretty meticulous about always downloading or ripping 320k and all of the songs I've had issues with I've tested the files on other sound systems (good 2.1 setups and headphones) and they sound great. 

I hardly ever use my CD player though and would love to get the sound working a bit better via iPod if that's at all possible :/

Also worth noting, songs played from the iPod that don't sink into the low bass distortion seem to play flawlessly.

1. One from the [high-res version you can buy on HDTracks or Qobuz](http://www.discogs.com/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories-%C3%89dition-Studio-Masters/release/4581717). This file is originally in 24/88 format, and the only thing that has been done to it is to cut it to length and saved as WAV.
2. … and one from the Mastered for iTunes version, converted to WAV, and very carefully upsampled to 88.2 kHz so file size and sample rate matches.

I've then prepared a Google survey that basically seeks the answer to one question: ""Which clip do you prefer, A or B?"". It asks you a couple of extra questions about your system, and what equipment you primarily used for listening to the test clips, and your system settings. Note that you should only fill in the survey once.

* [Google survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVXFR4FLdKw8KpB6vPu2g5c5dcxfK8nwTpCsNt7GWQM/viewform)
* [Test files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i15jzh46pza5nip/lossy-vs-lossless.zip) (25.5 MB zip) - [Mirror 1](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/lossy-vs-lossless.zip)


I'll keep the survey open until I have a reasonable number of responses, and will publish the data shortly after that (I'll quite probably publish the raw data, so people with a background in statistics can analyze them).      Please participate - since this is only two short clips, and merely asking you to subjectively tell which clip you prefer - it could take as little as five minutes, or as much time as you personally like to spend on it.

My current archival situation is 2 files per album that I rip - a single FLAC file of the audio, with a CUE sheet containing metadata. This works well for CDs that i rip, and allows me to burn a CD for use in my car or whatever. It also plays nice with Foobar2000....

But it doesn't play nice with other programs (like Ampache / Subsonic / Google Music). And i can't store the album art in the cuesheet, it would need to be a separate file. And i can't support non-CD standard audio, such as the occasional FLAC purchase from bandcamp - every once in a while, someone gives me 24bit 44.1Khz or 24-Bit 96KHz, and that just doesn't store in my archive like the CD quality stuff. Nor does it play nice with my bash scripts to downsample to MP3 for my portable devices.

So i'm thinking about switching to a container format, and i think OGG might fit the bill. I'm having a hard time finding the answers online though, so maybe one of you has experience. Can OGG do the following for me?

* Single container for lossless audio and metadata
* Supports track times (ie, i open it in Foobar2000 just like my CUE/FLAC files now and can go to the track points like on a CD or MP3 playlist)
* Supports per-track Performer data (For Various Artist discs/ releases)
* Allows me to embed album art
* Supports higher-than-CD quality (nonstandard bitrates / sample rates)

Thanks!

Edit: I haven't stopped googling yet. It looks like Matroska (.MKA file) might be more appropriate for this. I may also be over-thinking it, since i know you can embed the cuesheet in the FLAC, and apparently you can put the album art in there too... **If you've got experience storing albums losslessly as a single file (with track selection, proper tagging, and album art), i'd love to hear about it!**

I have an ongoing debate with my business partner about what the best settings for our final mixdown of a highly multi-tracked (40+) song we've made.

Due to some limitations in our hardware, the live portions of our recordings and the project itself is in 24bit/44.1KHz. But when it came time to make the final mixdown to a single, stereo track my partner decided to put the WAV settings on 16/44.1 for transfer to the mastering company.

I protested that we should set it as high as possible (at least 24/96) for the final mixdown. My reasoning is that we have many tracks playing back at 44.1KHz but not all the samples are perfectly lined up, especially after editing. Therefore, setting the sample rate to 96KHz or higher would yield a more accurate representation of what we hear in the studio mix.

He dismissed this logic, quoting some guy he knew saying that it doesn't matter since they're all 44.1, and that it may even worsen the sound by injecting noise through unnecessary samples.

Does it make sense to output the final mix at the highest rate possible??

**TL;DR: Does it help making the sample rate of the final mix of a multi-track recording higher than the individual tracks' settings?**

EDIT: Thanks all for replying! The factor I didn't know about was the sample alignment. With that in mind, yes it makes sense to leave it at 44.1KHz for mixdown, but leave the res at 24bit for mastering.

I'll gladly take any words of wisdom from you all.

I've been saving my pennies and at the moment I have around $6k to build a system. In two months, that could easily be $7K in my play account. I'm not exactly rich, just a part time job, but I basically save all my money after future college accounts.

My favorite past time would be movies. I have a collection of about 200 DVDs (no Blu-ray yet, unfortunately), and I truly love the home cinema experience. I also enjoy watching ""the big game"" or fights with friends, and I'm **very** much into music. I want a great system as far as mid-range equipment is concerned. So far, I've reviewed all of the components on CNET except for audio. That's where I get lost. Here is what I have so far (I'll link to CNET reviews, if that's okay)

1. Television: [Samsung UN55D8000 LED-LCD](http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/samsung-un55d8000/4505-6482_7-34503721.html)
2. AV Receiver: [Denon AVR-1912 with 7.1 channels](http://reviews.cnet.com/av-receivers/denon-avr-1912/4505-6466_7-34647681.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody)
3. Blu ray: [Panasonic DMP-BDT210](http://reviews.cnet.com/blu-ray-players-recorders/panasonic-dmp-bdt210/4505-9991_7-34468896.html?tag=mncol;lst;2)
4. Universal Remote: [Logitech Harmony 1100](http://reviews.cnet.com/remote-controls/logitech-harmony-1100/4505-7900_7-33485031.html)

Of course, the prices on these vary wildly depending on where I get them. Amazon currently has the tv on sale, for example, at about $2100 but my local Best Buy is about $2400 pre-tax. If I assume the ""deal"" of $2400, and Amazon's prices for the others, the total is about $3,675 after tax. That leaves me about $2,225-$3,225 to spend on the best audio I can. Just a rough estimate, of course, since it will be two months before I purchase. Also, there is still buffer room that I'm going to push to the max.

With that being said, I have no idea where to start with audio. I know that people can build it themselves for better than most HTIAB systems, but I was thinking there were better packaged deals if you're already starting out with the nicer quality audio (at least of the mid-range level). This [PSB Image T6 Speaker System](http://www.hometheater.com/content/psb-image-t6-speaker-system) (warning, there might be a pop-up) looks like it might be a great option. However, I have no idea if I'm getting completely screwed at this price point. I also don't know where to look for home audio. I don't want to sacrifice quality. I understand that I can't have an audiophile setup in my apartment with dimensions given below, but it should be stated that I do fully appreciate a nice sound, and my picky friends appreciate it even more. However, in a year that will change when I get a bigger place which will hopefully give me a better home theater. My audio equipment will hopefully last years and years, unlike my TV. Am I headed in the right direction for looking to get a great sound system? Am I completely going about this the wrong way?

Living arrangements: carpeted floors, only ~10ft viewing distance from TV to back wall where I sit, about 20ft left and right. Behind the TV is a free-standing wall about 15ft wide (meaning: there is a wall that I can walk around on either side that leads into a kitchen). My measurements might be off by 5ft or so in width, I don't know for sure because I haven't moved in yet. Will that affect anything? Also, please understand once again that even if this ""setup"" is a little too much for the tiny area, I will be moving into a nicer place in one year.

I hope I gave enough details. Let me know if I left anything out. Also, thanks again at helping a noob out.

___________________________________________________

Separate question: If I were to get something similar to this, specifically the 825 watt receiver with powerful speakers, I should be getting an amp to help power the speakers, correct? For example, if a receiver I get has about 120 watts/channel, but the tower speakers I decide to get are rated much higher, is that going to damage the system if I crank it up too loud? Will the quality degrade the louder it gets, unless I purchase an amplifier? I sadly haven't looked this up yet, and I should have before I made this post.

I found [this ehow article](http://www.ehow.com/how_4448174_subwoofer-computer-home-theater-system.html) and I read like a third of it.

I found out that I needed 12V power for my subwoofer and that my computer's power supply had yellow cables that gave 12V and black cables that were grounds.

Having recently upgraded to some Sennheiser HD598s, and consequently started flirting with the idea of a DAC/amp, I now think my whole setup is in need of a rethink. **Here's what I currently have**:




Music Sources: MacBook Pro / iPhone 4s

Mixer: Alesis Multimix 8 (connected to laptop via 3.5mm Headphone to Phono cable)

Speakers: Alesis M1A mkii Active monitors (Connected to mixer via balanced 1/4"" cables)

Headphones: Senny HD598 &amp; HD280pro



**Here's what I'm hoping to achieve:**

I'd like a reasonable DAC to deal with the laptop output. What I then need is this clean signal to go to the Active Monitors (which receive either 1/4"" or XLR I think, and I guess don't need any amplifying...) AND have a nicely amped headphone pathway for my 598s. 

Can such a thing be achieved in one box? I've previously looked at the Fiio E9/E17 combo as that seemed quite neat for having a DAC on the go for my iPhone. I don't mind getting rid of my mixer, as I don't record any more and I'm sure it's not an ideal piece of kit.

Is it normal to have have the volume that high just to get any sound out of your speakers?

I work in animation, motiongraphics and the occasional bit of game design . Which means I frequently find myself in need of very specific sound effects. Quite often sound effects that are difficult to find (affordably) but feel like I'd be able to produce quite easily myself.

That's why I want to look into buying a relatively simple setup for recording useable sound effects at home. I have no recording experience, I tend to learn software pretty quickly so it's primarily the hardware I'd like some advice on.

An example of the types of sounds I'd like to record... right now I have on my desk a half empty jar of nutella and a plastic gear I've been using in some kinetic sculpturing. And I just noticed that rolling the gear across the plastic cap on the nutella jar produces a beautiful rolling *prrrrrroing* sound. I'd love to be able to record things like that crisply.

I don't have a recording studio. Audio would probably be recorded in a normal room during quiet moments. I can spend some but not a fortune. I'd like to be as flexible as possible.

Personally I'm always amazed at the quality creative sound designers like [Diego Stocco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X2FJ_Yuuyk&amp;feature=plcp) manage to get with very little equipment. Is the setup he's using (and describing) in this youtube video a good start?",,False,,t5_2qhms,False,,,True,t3_wtaan,http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/wtaan/recording_sound_effects_at_home/,

I mainly listen to indie rock, electronic (armchair stuff like Burial, etc. that probably has more dynamic range than most dance music), and occasionally jazz.  I don't listen to classical music.

They do not need to be completely noise cancelling, but I often wear headphones on the PC when my wife is in the next room watching TV with the surround sound blaring.  I would like it if they reduce a fair amount of ambient noise, and do not leak too much noise.  I don't really plan on bringing them into the office, so if they leak a little it is ok.

I owned a pair of Sennheiser HD-280 headphones a few years ago, but sold them because they were very tight on my head and gave me a headache after about an hour.  I am looking for something comfortable I can wear for long periods of time (3+ hours at a time).

I'm looking to spend around $100, but could be convinced to spend up to $200 if necessary.

I'm looking to get a setup for running a webshow on Justin.tv. We're looking to get at least 5 speakers mic'd and then audio from up to 3 skype streams.
It was suggested to me by someone who does a similar project for the following equipment. Since I have no clue about any of this, can someone suggest some equipment for me?

* 1 Mixer (4 to 8 channels) ($99-$250)
* 1 Compressor ($99 - normalizes all the sound)
* 1 Headphone amp (this is how you can replicate the signal) ($99)
* Microphones - $89 - $300 depending on the quality etc.

I've been doing this for quite a while, and I guess I sort of just found decent audio levels (commentary vs game sound and general volume of the whole video) by a happy accident. Now, though, I've gotten a new setup with a proper desktop mic, and I am having some issues - or doubts, rather - when it comes to the audio levels.

My usual work procedure when I have to render my videos is to take the commentary track and the video track into Vegas, and reduce the volume of the layer with the video track until my own commentary is audible above it. But since I am somewhat unfamiliar with this microphone, I need some more technical way to figure out how to adjust the sound levels - at least until I get used to it.

I mean, the new mic might record my voice louder than what I'm used to. But I may not hear that because I may have my headset turned down a bit. Or it may record my voice lower than what I'm used to, but I wont hear it because the general volume on my computer is turned out.

I need to make sure that the end product - the video with game sound and my commentary above it - is at a volume level that isn't too low and isn't super loud so people have to adjust their speakers to just my videos. It's not really a problem to adjust my commentary TO the volume from my video, but the end result has to be within a decent volume range.

**Quick background:**  My wife and I sold our condo and bought our first house.  At the condo we had paper thin walls, and we got by with a simple Sony Sound-bar and a Bose Sound Dock.

**What I'd Like:**  Since we just bought the house, my ideal set up will have to come in timed upgrades.  I just don't know how to start.

* We would like surround sound set up for movie watching

* Ability to play music from ipods/iphones

* Stream our music from the XBOX/PS3/PC

* When playing music, it would need to be heard throughout the living area

* At one point, we would want outdoor speakers to entertain guests outside

* [Our Living Area](http://i.imgur.com/CAHb5.jpg)


I was hoping to keep it as simple as possible.  Specifically, I was looking at an out of the box speaker system, and complimenting that with Sonos speakers for playing music through the house.  However, being that I don't know enough about home audio, I don't think this is the best bang for my buck.

Help me r/audio!

Really comfortable leather pads that completely encase the ear (not just sit on it). The problem is, after using them frequently for several months the leather (faux leather?) started to crack off, and peel due to my stubble and hair, revealing a horrid gluey mess. I'm sure this has happened to many of you. 

For the 'short term' I fixed the problem by stitching some fabric over the decaying pads. Not very easy, but it worked. Now, years later, the hinge has snapped on the side from stress. The headphones are still under warranty, so they're being replaced.

When I get the new ones, I don't want the same problem to happen again, so I'd like some advise on how to protect the leather pads on my new headphones.

Here are the specs for the speakers as listed on the back:
*Woofer: 8"" cone, Mid range: 4"" cone, tweeter: 2"" cone
*Impedance: 8 ohms
*Max Power: 35 Watts

When I hooked up the speakers to my receiver, they both are working but I immediately noticed that one speaker was considerably louder than the other. It sounds like only the mid-range driver is working in the quieter speaker. My first thought was that the capacitors in the crossover might need replacing, so I opened up the speakers to see what was going on inside. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/aCvg6.jpg) is what I found when I opened the speakers. Everything seems to be in decent condition and all connections seem solid- but the [crossover situation](http://i.imgur.com/XbHHq.jpg) is beyond perplexing to me. From my basic understanding of speaker crossovers, this is missing several elements. 

Right now, I am trying to understand why this speaker was made using only 2 capacitors instead of a more standard crossover system. I have incessantly searched google to figure this out, but it seems even most stereo speakers from this time period used a traditional crossover. Does anyone have any idea what is going on with these speakers? (Also, the other speaker, which is working perfectly, looks *exactly* the same on the inside). 

Right now, my goal is to get these speakers back in working order. Should I try to simply replace the capacitors and stick with this system or should I replace the whole system with a standard 3-way crossover? 

I greatly appreciate any advice or opinions about this project. ",,False,,t5_2qhms,False,,,True,t3_ey4p5,http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/ey4p5/vintage_speaker_repair_question/,

I was wondering whether anybody could recommend a pair of durable headphones that will offer similar or better sound quality and won't be significantly bigger (dual driver headphones, like IE 6 are just too big for me); I would also very much prefer non-symmetrical cables, seems like every single pair of headphones more expensive than, say 70 euro have symmetrical cables, what's the deal with that?? I find non-symetrical cables A LOT more convenient;


also if they could come in black that would be deadly; I would be willing to spend around a 100 euro, more would probably be an overkill given the nature of my music (mostly electronica, 160-320kbps mp3s), audio equipement (nexus one phone or laptop with integrated sound card) and perception (i wouldn't exactly call myself an audiophile)

I also have a cheap pair of headphones from Radioshack and a DigiTech vocoder which I don't know how to use.

I know none of this is particularly suitable to my needs, although I think the FocusRite 2i2 might do for now. I need to start somewhat on a budget but then as I start getting more jobs that will be less and less of a concern and I eventually intend to have a fully professional studio with ISDN and so forth and at that point I'll probably even rent the use of it to other actors.

However, I don't know entirely what I need to get. I know I'll need a quality condenser microphone and some better headphones and I know how to use Audacity. However, I assume I'll need other things as well. 

Of course I've been in professional studios before and they have rooms covered with some kind of sound dampening insulation but I don't have a spare room to do that to yet. Would something like this product solve that problem or is this some nonsense gimmick? http://voiceoveressentials.com/content/porta-booth-plus.htm And if this product would solve that problem, is there a way I can make that myself?

I could just buy their entire set up at VoiceOverEssentials if those products actually seem good because I can afford that, but my better senses tell me it would be smarter to consult here and get my own components.

For one thing, I don't care if the product is new. That is, I don't think I should care. Is there any damage worthy of consideration in a used product that I should be very worried about or does the usual logic apply? If the usual logic does apply, what are good models of all of the components I should purchase used and where is a good place to find them?

Right now I could spend about 300 dollars on a good condenser microphone used or new. I could spend equally as much on each of the other components I'll need, but I just really don't know what to get at the moment.

Edit: I happened to run into an Audio Engineer at an audition since writing this. He recommended that I might like to try a Ribbon microphone because of my particular vocal quality, being somewhat antiquated. I expected that I'd have to buy more components that I hadn't heard of than I actually do so it seems so far, so I think I could actually spend at least $1,000. Any thoughts on Ribbon vs. Condenser?

Last year i picked up a [AT2020USB] (http://www.amazon.com/Technica-AT2020USB-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B008BSWBJQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362638617&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=AT2020) mic, which i have been using and havent had any problems with when speaking is at a normal level.

The problem comes when voice levels become increased, like when yelling occurs, and the subsequent audio track isnt the best to listen to.

At the moment game sounds and the mic are both just recorded using FRAPS, but im thinking for better audio quality i may need to record mic with a different program but im not sure exactly how to get the audio thats desired.

The first video, [Part One] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qkK_Iepaig&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU2RjhzcZDNZAdnKCG_0j2CA), demonstrates within the first 30 seconds the bad audio quality and ""boomyness"" i guess of the loud parts. Warning to turn the audio down a bit before listening.

On [Part Two] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXeSzqERdGE&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU2RjhzcZDNZAdnKCG_0j2CA) i tried to nomilise the audio and fix the problem as much as i could, however i couldnt really find any good tutorials on how to make it better.

[This video] (http://youtu.be/iLmJyoKJb6s) is a good example i think of what we are aiming for with the sound being quite even throughout and still very good, even when more emotion or yelling occurs.

At the moment i have access to Vegas pro 12, which is used for all video editing, Sound forge 10 and Adobe Master Collection CS5.

Any advice on how to get some better audio, whether it be recording through specific software, or requiring more hardware, would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks for the info guys, checked the mic gain levels like suggested and found them to be at 100, obviously being full it was going to cause some peaking.

Route one is simply moving to a dedicated PCI soundcard (unfortunately my PCIe x1 slot is completely inaccessible thanks to dual-slot graphics cards) and buying decent 5.1 PC speakers - my concerns with this is I have no idea where all the noise is coming from and am unsure whether sound from the card would suffer the same fate and I'm not sure how good this would be in terms of sheer music.

Route two is a little more abstract (which is actually my primary concern), my motherboard has a S/PDIF optical out (TOSLINK?) so if I bought a Micro-System (I have no idea whether the're known as that these days given big stereos don't seem to exist any more) with a S/PDIF in and used it's speakers then I'm digital out of the PC and safe from the noise, right? Also stereo speakers seem like they should be better suited to music over PC speakers.

My primary concern is sheer musical fidelity, I do of course do other stuff with my PC (like game) but that's all secondary, I'm in the UK which might affect things and am looking to spend around £100-£150 with £200 the absolute top.

Some things to think about and quite a few questions!,DvineINFEKT,5,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/167o26/getting_my_first_actual_interface_some_things_to/,"Hey /r/audio! It's been a while. Thanks for helping me work out my issues in the summer setting a PA for the backyard show. It was a huge success, and I've learned a lot since then! Gonna have to apologize somewhat for the wall of text - I ask questions, that's how I learn. :P Since the summer, I've been getting into recording and it all starts with an interface. Up until now, I've used my POD X3 Live as my interface, sticking with digital drums, etc. Preliminary stuff is okay, but nothing I polished enough for showcase. YET.

Setting up an apartment-sized recording studio has been far less time-consuming that I want it to be. I'm a broke college student, you see. Now that I've finally got some decent-quality speakers ([AVID's BX5-D2's](http://www.zzounds.com/item--MDOBX5D2), which I found at a great bargain at only $85 a speaker. I'll pick up a sub some other day) I'm going to finally need an actual interface, which are the main thing I'm researching now. The main two I've decided on possibly getting are the [Scarlett 18i6, by FocusRite](http://www.zzounds.com/item--FOCSCAR18I6) or the [ProFire 610, by M-Audio](http://www.zzounds.com/item--FOCSCAR18I6) which are comparably priced. 

A few questions I'm concerned about, and maybe you guys can help recommend me something (keep in mind, my price point is right around these products ~$300, and it has to be durable and able to withstand the occasional ""being slammed into a backpack and hitting the road"" bumps and bruises).

- **Any other interfaces I should absolutely consider? Why?**

- The main drawback for the FirePro 610 is the necessity for FireWire, which my friends computers don't all have. A FireWire card for my computer is no big deal, approximately 10-30 bucks. But I've heard the future is pretty grim in general for FireWire in favor of USB 3.0 or even eSata. **What do you guys think about this?** Is it just doomsaying? **I'm willing to put down for the FirePro if FireWire performs substantially more reliably...but does it?** If it's not really that much better, USB 2.0 - or even 3.0 (which my computer can use) - is surely the way to go, right? **Are there any USB 3.0 interfaces even out yet? What else could I be looking into?**

- One of the most important concerns I've got in getting an interface is the pre-amps. The ones on the Line 6 POD X3 are obviously not meant for heavy duty vocal recordings, and it shows. It doesn't help that I'm using one of my (dynamic) bands stage mics for recording, and...well...I imagine the [Audix OM-2](http://www.zzounds.com/item--AUDOM2) can find a better utilization than in a death metal or hardcore punk rock song. **Is it just in my head to be worrying about pre-amps on an interface, or are the ones in the POD as bad as I'm imagining? Will a ""proper"" interface make the difference I hope it will?** I guess I'll tell soon enough anyway, right?

- On that note, **are there any awesome mics you guys would consider absolutely imperative?** I think it's about time I joined the big boys club and got a condenser. Research is going to have to happen soon... ;)

- Those monitors I mentioned earlier, the BX5 D2's. **Is there any distinct advantage between using XLR over TRS cable or TRS over XLR?** I mean, the difference between TS and TRS is there for sure, but TRS and XLR are just hot, cold, and ground lengths right? Surely there's not much a difference in quality *per se*. I feel like I might go with XLR just because they lock in, but I can't think of any reasons besides that. Just stuff to know for the future.

The noise can be heard in the same time when I'm moving my cursor, dragging windows or doing pretty much anything at all. If I do nothing the noise is very rarely heard.

I was planning on running 2 in 2 different systems. 2 mounted in my truck (which has no spare room) and 2 for my ht setup. I have a cheapie 2.1 computer setup I am currently using. I was planning on grabbing the output to the sub in the enclosure/amp to a lp-2020a, then it's 2 outputs to each transducer. Would I be able to grab the input from the sub's wires and have the sub work? If not, I'm sure I can grab the signal from the board pre-amps pretty easily. 

The second install would be my truck. It's a regular cab, and packed constantly. I found some space under the rear shelving where I can mount directly to sheet metal, less than 6"" from the back of the seats. I have a stock HU, but plan on running a car amp with high-level in to run the transducers. 

Anyone have any tips for transducer use/installation? 

If everything goes as planned, I'm actually thinking of building a portable boombox with them as well. Figured I could run 1 or 2 transducers, 2 6x9's, a small odyssey battery, maybe 2 lp-2020a amps.. I haven't thought enough about it to decide to either go lipo or odyssey batteries. Price is the same, but odysseys are amazing batteries..

Thanks in advance for reading!

I purchased a FiiO E7 sometime ago to have a splitter &amp; DAC for my laptop (handy when traveling with a buddy and you want to watch a movie together) and as a portable amp for my phone.

When I use the USB connection to my laptop, the sound is great and I hear sound from both the L and R audio channels. When I use the 3.5mm audio jack from my phone however, audio will be great for a few weeks. Eventually the audio cable connecting my phone to the e7 gets really finnicky about the angle which I'll get audio from both channels, and then eventually only one side will work. I use the same headphones in both scenarios so I know its not the headphones.

* 1. Could it be a problem with the 3.5mm audio jack on my e7?
* 2. Am I using poor quality cables? (I used the ones provided by FiiO first, those broke and I got another one off monoprice but those have just stopped working as well)
* 3. Am I just not storing male-male 3.5mm audio cable well? Typically when I unplug the cable from commuting, to using the USB connection on my work laptop, I just leave the audio cable sitting on my desk.

The only good news is the quality between Audacity and Mumble are the same, so I'm inclined to believe it isn't a software problem.

Is this enough, or will I have to purchase a higher quality dedicated sound card as well, or even more?

I'm having a major issue with my home rig. I just moved apartments, and since I've set up my stuff, there's no bass at all where I'm sitting. Kick drums sound like paper bags.

I've had the same exact rig for 6 months, and at my old place (pictured [here](http://imgur.com/4NHlR) ) I had my monitors on the bar/counter of my kitchen and had great overall sound. 

Here is a photo of my new spot ([far away](http://imgur.com/NQZr1) and [up close](http://imgur.com/YnXSR) on the rig). 

Am I breaking some obvious rules of acoustics as far as my positioning of everything? I've **checked all wiring a dozen times**, **replaced my amp**, and consulted various friends. Everyone agrees it sounds like total shit. I also realized that when I **back away (maybe 10 feet) from the monitors, I can hear the kick drum/bass much better.** It's still not great, but definitely an improvement. I know these are **NS-10s** and they aren't known for their bass, but I've been using them for months and know what they are capable of. It's lead to me to believe that this is a room issue. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what might be causing this, or any ideas for me to try out? At this point I'll do anything, I have deadlines this week and I really don't want to have to rent a studio.

The trunk in my car gathers a helluva lot of condensation, so since it's winter, I had to take the whole setup inside.

I want to be able to use my car amplifier (with subs attached) with my current home sound system. I've looked at a bunch of guides and youtube videos, but half of these people are 14 year olds with questionable electronic education.

My amplifier has two 30A fuses, so does that mean I need a +12V PSU with an amperage rating of 60V? One of the PSUs I own is rated for 41A (500w/12v) and another I have is rated for 29A (350w/12v). Would I be able to use both to power the amplifier?

My understanding is on the PSU I can connect the PS_ON wire (green) with a ground wire (black) and then I attach the yellow wires to the positive amplifier terminal and the black wires to the negative terminal on the amplifier.

What are the risks of using two PSUs with a car amplifier and am I an idiot to even attempt it?

This leads us to my next option, using a car battery inside attached to the amplifier with a battery charger attached to the battery at all times. This sounds like a simpler option. My understanding of this is that I attach all the wires as normal, but the ground, instead of being attached to the chassis of the car, attach it to the negative battery terminal. Then I attach the ""remote on"" wire to the +12V terminal and I'm set. My only concern about this is, is it alright to leave the charger attached at all times, and if it were to be disconnected, how long (approx.) would the battery last before dying?

Sorry for the wall of text, I just need help from somebody with a little electrical knowledge. I'm also hoping that this is the right subreddit to post my query in. If not, I wouldn't mind being kindly pointed in the right direction.

Thanks to anyone who can help me out!

Of course, atmospheric pressure would be applied to the front face of the cone, so a spring would be needed to counterbalance this force. The result would be a loudspeaker that generates sound exactly corresponding to the input signal, with no destructive interference.

My current setup is a some Klipsch ProMedia 4.1 PC speakers from my undergrad years and some Beyerdynamic DT 880 headphones that I love.  The Klipsch speakers served me well at a desk for years but don't have a very big vertical sound field (if I'm saying that right) due to a sort of squashed horn tweeter shape.

I have a Pioneer SX-737 that I restored (new capacitors and relay).  I've always heard some hissing from the headphone jack, but nothing too bad since I never really had decent headphones.  That changed when I got some ATH-M50 headphones and now the hiss / background noise is very apparent even with zero volume.  There is little to no audible hiss on the speakers unless the volume is at max.  The headphones work without hiss when plugged directly into the sound card output, but I'd much rather use the amp. 

Now, looking into the service manual for the Pioneer, I see that the headphones are driven directly from the power amplifier with some resistors to bring the signal down.  It also states in the specifications that the output for headphones is 4-16 Ohms, and the headphones are 38 Ohms.

*You can record up to 8 simultaneous tracks.
* you can record up to 16 tracks.
* you can do a rough mix (with effects and equalizers) straight in it; or dump all the tracks to a DAW and work it there.

Use my haier soundbar for my tv (same room as receiver, can be wired)

Use 2-3 sets of wireless speakers in other rooms (bedrooms, kitchen)

Be able to send signal to receiver via Bluetooth or AirPlay (iPhone)

Be able to pick/choose what rooms are getting sound at a particular time (living room + kitchen, only bedroom, whole house, etc.)

Will all of these wireless signals cause interference with each other? Is there even a receiver that will output Bluetooth signals? Is this whole idea too far fetched, and I need to go with a wired setup?

1. Where does the signal come from?  I never thought about this before.  A CD or mp3 audio file only has 2.0 information in it, right?  I assume that the amp/receiver/something in the chain will just filter out based on frequency, pulling the bass out of the stereo channels and redirecting to the sub.  But, that's just an assumption.  Is it right?

2. My current rig is a HTIB receiver with a dedicated speaker wire socket for the non-powered sub.  I want to move to something physically smaller, like a T-class amp if possible.  These are always stereo-only, from what I can see.  I take it this means I need either a powered sub, or a full-size receiver with the sub amp built in.  Do any smaller amps exist that will power two speakers and a non-powered sub?  

3. I'm kind of in love with this thing- http://www.crutchfield.com/p_772N22/Audioengine-N22.html  Reading another thread here- http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/1hk7r8/how_to_make_a_real_21_setup_for_pc/cav5cbw This leads me to believe that the ""high level input"" is being filtered by the powered sub to only let the low freqs get to the subwoofer.  Is that right?  If so, is there a quality trade off doing the filtering there, rather than in the receiver?  Is there anything to be gained by using a non-powered sub and using the receiver to amplify it?  

Thanks everybody, and zeos in particular for the info I've read so far.

I haven't been able to find much in my resarch so far. I have never built a PC for audio production before so if someone knowledgeable on the subject has some advice I would really appreciate it.

Please note that the hardware is not finalized, I might switch over to a Haswell chip and 1150 motherboard if the price/performance is worth it, also considering an SSD/HDD combo instead of just the large HDD. I will definitely appreciate suggestions on those things but I am mostly concerned with any problems we will face on the audio hardware side of things because that's what I am unfamiliar with.

I'm going to be buying a computer within he week solely for the purpose of gaming. I also have another computer which I do audio production on and so to cover all my needs I was thinking about getting a pair of open headphones like the Audio Technica AD700. This would no doubt be great for gaming as I could hear specific things and great for my music. However, I did have one minor concern as far as gaming goes.

When I play games I like to more-or-less immerse myself into the game and put reality aside for a bit. When I use closed cups, that's pretty easy to do because I can't really hear much outside of the cans. I've never actually used a pair of open headphones before but I feel like the experience would be less immersive and keep me more root to reality. I don't know if this is actually true but at least from what I've seen from the design of those Audio Technica's is that they don't really look like they cup your ear and trap sound in your head but just rest on your ears allowing everything to flow in and out.

I currently use my PC and my console on the same display sitting right next to eachother, and would like to be able to push the audio for both out through the same headphones in one stereo mix, ideally with controllable volumes on each input, and (if possible) DAC/Amp capabilities as well.  Right now it's a really bad solution of splitters and adapters that just... isn't anywhere near an ideal solution.

Bonus points if:

* I can control the volume of each input channel independently.
* It has a built-in USB-driven DAC to maintain the audio quality coming out of my computer.
* Reasonably priced
* Separate AC power not required (USB power enough?)
* Works well sitting on a desk (inputs all on rear, etc.)

Right now I'd be looking at taking in audio from a PC either through USB or 3.5mm, and audio from my PS3 through RCA (although I could do optical, it seems overkill,) and sending it out through 3.5mm or .25"" to my [headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphone-Gunmetal/dp/B003BYRGKY).

I have my computer and PS3 connected to a preamp, then the signal goes to a crossover, which then splits to a NAD amplifier and an old harmon/karmon amp which is the one that blew.

Very new here but hope someone can help. I recorded some gameplay footage with DXTory and seem to have accidentally chosen Ogg Vorbis as the codec for my microphone recording.
Now, when I go to edit/play the file, I cannot seem to get it to work at all.

I run 64x Windows which seems to be part of the problem.

Considerations

- Price - $200-300, can't afford a top end audiophile model, sorry!

- An equalizer that allows customizable presets. The Cowon S9's EQ was outstanding. Sound quality trumps everything other than price.

- Interface/ease of use - The Cowon wasn't the best. No playlist support, the interface was klunky and the bundled JetAudio software was garbage. **Playlist support would be very, very nice.**

- Storage - Probably not a consideration, but expandable storage via micro SD would be nice. [edit] 8Gb minimum

- Support of formats other than MP3 is nice but not necessary. I couldn't hear the difference between FLAC and MP3 (using Denon D2000s with a m-stage headphone amp.) Also, I get most new music in MP3 format from Amazon, and encode with EAC/LAME for anything I have on CD.

- Power/battery - I have a headphone amplifier to use at work and use IEMs at home so power is not a consideration. Long battery life is nice.

Support for gapless playback is a must = No HiFiMan (like I could afford any but the least expensive anyways.)

Brands

Cowon - Solid recommendation from audiophiles. Interface of the S9 wasn't the greatest, but I can live with it. I have a feeling that I'll wind up with another Cowon.

Zune = Maybe. I've heard good things about the Zune but they're discontinued and still command a premium price.

Samsung Galaxy Player - I have some reservations since this isn't primarily a music player, but it does have a lot of extras. If you have one and can compare it to a good quality MP3 player I'd like to hear it.

Apple = no, for reasons too long to go into here.

I recently decided to produce some pieces independently after school and some time in commercial radio. I'm doing a public-radio-style program (think Radiolab or 99% Invisible) with a buddy of mine. Right now, I'm just using a Zoom H2, Adobe Soundbooth, and my 5 year old iMac for everything since in the past all of the gear I used was whatever the stations I worked at had available.

I'm doing some research elsewhere as well, but I'd like to know is your recommendations for essential equipment for a public radio style show that does a fair amount of recording in the field as well as one-on-one interviews.

I don't have the resources to splurge and get an ideal setup, but I want to save up and buy great pieces in the long-term that I will not regret purchasing later. These can be microphones, cables, adapters, headphones, hardware, software, or anything that you think would be part of an ideal setup for a radio producer that works in the field and at home. 

So, based on your experience, what gear would an independent radio producer need to make his pieces and guests sound their best?

So I bought a set of TDL RTL 3 Transmission line speakers. I know they are pretty old, but my friend has a set and I quite like them. [You can see the spec. for them here.](http://www.tdl-loudspeakers.co.uk/tech_specs/rtl3.pdf) 

Problem is, I'm not exactly sure what amp to get for them, my friend was running them through an old Audiolab 8000, which sounded pretty good. I definitely see that as a viable option.

I have them in a fair sized bedroom at the moment and won't need a massive amount of volume out of them. They are 8Ohm impedance with a 90db/w/m sensitivity (which I think is quite high).

The thing is, was reading about t-amps, and was thinking I might try one out- since everyone seems to love them and they are cheap as chips. I was thinking if I was able to get a decent sound this way it would do as a kind of stop-gap until an Audiolab or viable alternative shows up in my area on gumtree/ ebay.

I was wondering if anyone could give be some advice as to whether this is a good idea? 

The t-amps I looked at (e.g. the lepai 2020) all seem to put out around 20W into 4Ohms and slightly less into 8. Do I run the risk of damaging the speakers with an underpowered amp (20W per channel and up is recommended on the spec. sheet I linked)? Or could I get away with it at fairly low volumes?

I intend to record straight to the laptop using the microphone using audacity. I've tested the equipment out and everything seems to work, I've been wondering about a few things though.


1. After recording, my output level is at -24, while the sound is clear it seems like this is a bit quiet. What should I aim to have my output level at (e.g. -12 or 0) and should I do this through editing or is there a way I could have the desired output level without editing? My control panel settings have the input level of the mic at 100%


2. How close to the mic should the actor be? (sorry if this seems like a silly question)


3. When I'm recording a voice actor. Should I record their whole part without pressing ""stop"" once, or should I record a few lines then stop before recording the next few lines? The reason I ask is because I'm not sure if it's better to have lots of small audio files, or one long audio file.


4. Once I've recorded the voice actor's lines, do I ""save project"" or export? I'm assuming I export the audio files so I can edit them together later. I'm not sure which format to export to, I read somewhere that FLAC is the best, should I export it as multiple formats?


5. I'm going to use audacity to record AND edit the whole thing (it's around 30 minutes long) is this advisable?


6. Most of the time I was recording, the sound was very clear, however one particular recording sounded a bit tinny. If the audio isn't perfect the first time around what are my chances of ""recovering"" it by editing the sound file and adding effects?


7. Is my equipment choice ok?


That's all the questions I have for now, any answers or general advice would be great!

Now, there are several input channels:

- CD
- Phono

- VCR 2
- VDP

The last three have a video channel, too, which I would not use anyway.

Now, I do not know anything about the receiver, since it is probably older than I am, but I used the Tape 1 input for some time now since it is the only one that works properly without having to hold the cables at the right angle.

However, I do like to talk with friends. Currently, it's a case of one or the other. I have come up with this hair brained scheme and I wanted to know if it would work. There would theoretically be 3 channels to this setup.

**PC Sound**

The sound from my PC would go to a splitter. One side of this goes to my receiver and the other goes to the mixer.

**XBox Game Sound**
Since I play on an HDMI monitor, I plan on getting an XBox audio only adapter that outputs in 2 RCA outputs. From there, I use an RCA splitter. I connect one set of the RCA splitter to my receiver in case I want to use my speakers instead of headphones and the other 2 go to an RCA to 3.5mm stereo adapter which goes to the mixer.

**XBox Headset Audio**

This is where I really have a question. My first thought is to use a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter on the controller itself since that port is a 2.5mm port. From there, I would split that cable. One side of the split would go to the mixer, thus completing all 3 parts of the mix. The strange part would be the audio from my mic to the controller. Would plugging the mic into a female to female coupler which is connected to the splitter do it or will I need something special to have audio going both ways on the cable like it does with the standard XBox headset?

**Side Note**
Could you recommend a mixer which will work with 3+ channels and maintain stereo sound? I'd like to stay around $30-$40 but I'm probably in the wrong ballpark there...

Hi there, around the end of November I currently plan on building a PC. Right now I'm using a laptop and a second monitor with no built in speakers so I realized that unless I want to be stuck using my headset (Tritton AX720) all the time, I'm going to need some speakers.

I'm in a college dorm that is about 12' x 16'. The current motherboard I have selected for my computer is capable of running a 7.1 setup but with my limited space and budget, I've decided to spend more money on less speakers and go with either a 2.0 or 2.1 setup. My budget is rather limited because I'm a poor college kid so I'd really like to stay below $150 but if you are a smooth enough talker and the price increase is really worth it, I might stretch my money and go $200-250.

I will be using this system for everything from music to movies and games. Music genres are pretty much rock, heavy metal, country, and orchestra/choir music (I like listening to soundtracks. Hans Zimmer ftw). I need good lows for guns and whatnot in games and movies but good sound reproduction for the music. I'm afraid this will be difficult on a budget.

If my extremely limited audio knowledge serves me right, the only difference in a 2.0 and a 2.1 channel setup is the presence of a sub in the 2.1. If it'd be better to go with a higher quality pair of speakers without a sub for now and save up for a sub later on, I'm completely ok with that.

As far as connectivity goes, I'd rather not mess with an amp or anything like that. I'd prefer the money to go into the speakers themselves. Also, my monitor also serves as the screen for when I'm using my PS3 but since the monitor has no built in speakers, I'm completely forced to use my headset. If there exists a speaker/speaker system out there that would have the ability to work with my PS3, that'd be great. However, I want to note that this would be a complete extra and is nowhere near required.


As a quick recap:

* Under $150 budget but willing to go $200-$250 if REALLY worth it.
* Used for games, movies, wide range of music genres.
* Room is roughly 12' x 16'
* Sub is optional.
* PS3 connectivity would be amazing but not at all required.
* Using motherboard's onboard audio.

- increase keyboard output level, decrease amp volume
- use line output from keyboard instead of headphone output

Such a tempting prospect and seems like a great idea for the smaller gigs where it's difficult to get the mixer into a good position to get a good mix. If I get a little more adventurous I could also eliminate the need for my annoyingly heavy snake and just plonk the mixer backstage and just sit at FOH with my iPad. 

I have googled for hours and not really found a satisfactory answer, what's the best way of getting a decent and constant wifi signal to the iPad from the desk. Can I hack into the venues wifi or do I need a seperate connection?

Thoughts, ideas, other.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: just to clarify I already have some proper mixers, although analogue. I have a big 32 channel Allen &amp; Heath desk and a smaller 12 channel soundcraft desk both of which I use frequently on various jobs. 

I already own an iPad 

Venturing into digital mixers is fairly expensive whereas this is quite cheap really, I've always liked mackie gear and they tend to pump out good stuff.

If there is a gig where I can use the analogue desk without any issue (when cable management is dealt with by a team of crew) I will, but for some of my gigs this would be bloody useful and a great help.

For example I do a gig where the FOH is actually in an alcove to the side of the room where i can not hear what the fuck is going on. Being able to walk out to the middle with an iPad and get a good sound would save me a world of pain trying to tell a lampy which pot to fiddle with on the desk to make it sound right. 

I agree, real controls on a real desk with an optional iPad would be better but at the moment times are tight and I don't have that money to spend on that kind of desk. ",,False,,t5_2qhms,1341940434.0,,,True,t3_wa27m,http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/wa27m/mackie_dl1608/,

The other pair I'm looking at are the Sennheiser HD-380s. The 770s apparently have better sound quality, but these are not amateur headphones and they fold up very flat and come with a semi-hard case (something important to me as I throw my cans in a backpack).

What are your guys' experiences? Am I pretty much going to like either one of these choices? Do you have any comparable alternates? Would like to keep the price below $200.

1338745183.0,6,self.audio,uisra,USB Audio Interface or compact desktop mixer?,Arve,11,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/uisra/usb_audio_interface_or_compact_desktop_mixer/,"I originally tried asking this over in /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers, but didn't get much in the way of a sensible reply, so I'm trying here instead.

I have a setup consisting of a MacBook Pro, two iOS devices running various synth software, a pair of active studio monitors and a high-quality headphone amplifier.

On the software side of things, I'm very much a tracker person, so Renoise is the drug of choice, and I would now like to be able to route at least two of the iOS devices to separate (stereo) inputs in my modules.

Originally, I had thought I should be buying a compact desktop mixing console, but I've since realised that unless I pay extortion-style money, desktop mixers like Behringer's won't let me do digital multitrack recording, but instead force me to premix in analog, which makes me lose individual DSP chains for each instrument.

So, I'm looking for a USB Audio interface that lets me:

1. Connect three analog stereo line-level inputs, and send them as indivdual channels on the laptop. Also a question: I see most of the USB audio mixers have combined instrument/mic inputs - can these be used to connect line-level sources such as an iPad?
2. I need to run whatever recording software is used as a ReWire slave. Most of the time I won't be recording anything through it, use it as a sequencer, or use DSP effects, but I'll simply be using it as passthrough to the ReWire host which does all the processing.
3. As this rig also serves as my main setup, where I periodically use the iPad for watching videos when I'm working, I need two line-level outputs: One that goes to the monitors, and one to the headphone amp.
4. Do any of these devices come with mixer style controls? One of the reasons for thinking of a regular mixer in the first place was ergonomics.  I don't really fancy digging through a digital interface because I want to mute specific inputs or outputs because I want to watch a video on the iPod, or I want to use my headphone amp's digital input instead of the analog. 

Note, I haven't specified a price, but music is a hobby, so ""affordable"" is a huge bonus. 

As for products I've been looking at, the one that has appeared most tempting so far is the Zoom R8 - the difference in price between that and for instance the M-Audio FastTrack Pro is negligble, but it has the added bonus of being able to act as a control surface for ReNoise. Will the R8 do what I want, or   should I be looking for something else?

(Also, I'm very confused with the terminology 2x2 when applied to USB audio interfaces - does that imply two stereo tracks in and out, or two mono/one stereo pair?)",,False,,t5_2qhms,False,,,True,t3_uisra,http://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/uisra/usb_audio_interface_or_compact_desktop_mixer/,

My Allen + Heath Xone:22 two channel DJ mixer just started acting up. This problem was first noticed a few days after I forgot my mixer, in its flight case, in the trunk of my vehicle overnight. Outside of the flight case had some condensation on it the next morning when I remembered about it, so the internals of the mixer could have seen some condensation too. The problem is with Channel 1. 

With a stereo audio source connected to channel 1 via the line input, audio is only coming out of the right speaker. I've tested the main XLR outputs as well as the monitor output and the situation is the same. 

However, *if the filter/fx loop button is engaged*, the audio exits correctly, in stereo.

This leads me to believe that there's some issue on the circuit board downstream of the filter/fx button, where channel 1 ties into the main L/R out.

Channel 2 doesn't exhibit this behavior.

[This](http://imgur.com/a/zQKRL#T45Do) image shows the block diagram for the mixer, which I've highlighted to show the signal path with both the filter/fx button on and off. With the filter/fx button **OFF**, I'm only getting audio from the RIGHT output, but with the filter/fx button **ON**, I'm getting correct stereo output.  

So... I have some idea of where the problem lies in the signal chain, but I have no idea how to correct it. 

I posted a less detailed description of this problem to r/djs, and some suggested that I check for dry solder joints on the circuit board. Problem is, I have no idea how to relate the block diagram to the actual flow of audio on the circuit board. A crappy picture of the internals of the mixer is found [here](http://imgur.com/a/zQKRL#U5K8R).



**Can anyone point me in the correct direction to getting this mixer working again?** 

I'm the second owner, and the mixer is out of warranty. My only options are to attempt to fix it myself or bring it somewhere to get repaired. The mixer only cost me $300, and I'm sure I can't get it professionally looked at for under $100, so I'd like to take care of it myself if at all possible.

I recently moved into an apartment that has speaker wire distributed to every room in the house (just plain old speaker with with bare wire screwdown connectors, not 1/8"" jacks or anything like that), so I thought it would be nice to set up a media server and write some interfaces so that we could control it with our phones/tablets.

The software, I'm not too worried about. I can either use something out there, or write it (or, most likely, a combination of both). I'm having a hard time trying to find ideas for the kind of hardware to use. Ideally, I'd like each room to have a separate audio device associated with it, so that we can play different music in different rooms, shut rooms off that we're not in, etc. Once I do find something, I'd need something that works at least marginally well with Linux. I know a lot about the software side of things, but I know basically fuck-all about audio.

Since it's bare wire, I need some sort of amplifier, either in the speakers themselves, or by the computer, right? Does the signal need to be amplified before it goes into the wall? I imagine some of these cables are 15-20m. I'm not averse to spending some money, although I'd prefer not to spend a ton of it.

To get signal, i first tapped into the wires coming into the factory amp in the trunk (which has been removed).  I used a LOC to tap into the signal wires and provide 4x RCA that would go to my amp.  I had a lot of noise doing it this way, and decided to just run RCA's from the head unit. 

I made a custom RCA harness that feeds into a 4x shielded RCA run that goes down the passenger side to the main amp.  That amp has a pair of RCA out that feeds a signal to the subwoofers amp. 

The problem: Cabin speakers sound good, but I do hear noise.  Turning on the subwoofer makes the noise/thumping unbearable even with the gain turned almost to 0 and the EQ set low.  Turning the EQ to where it should be makes this much worse. The HU and the AMPs are grounded at separate points, as the HU is up front, and the amps are in the trunk.  

The one thing I haven't tested is to see if the noise isn't coming out of the main amp; but, again, I do hear a little bit of noise from the cabin speakers; I'm guessing the sub is just playing the noise more noticeably due to the lower frequency response.

**A reward to any redditor who can help me get rid of this noise**; I'd be happy to provide a month of reddit gold or something similar.  I haven't been able to crank my stereo in forever and it's driving me absolutely nuts.

So I'm building a set of body microphones for a sound project, and they're all different sized contact microphones, and while they all have different frequency responses (which I'm OK with) the innate noise floor/dynamic range of all of them seems to be similar, if not exactly the same. This would be good if I wasn't putting some on my throat and others on the bottom of my feet. So I basically need to reduce the sensitivity of the microphone element. I don't know though if I can do that without just decreasing the amplitude of the signal without affecting the dynamic range, if that makes sense. I'm looking into acoustic isolation for the capsule. Silicon caulk is the material I've been working with, and I think a disc on top and one below sealed around the edge could be enough, to but I want to explore acoustic and electric options simultaneously. Especially if the silicon molds I'm making don't reduce the amplitude by much.  

Hopefully one of y'all has a better grasp on the electrical aspect of microphone construction than I. As I've not found any solid literature on the subject, and the few experiments I've done with resistors seem to filter frequency content (which could be useful, but that's a pretty big area to blindly wave a soldering iron around in.) I'd appreciate any feedback, or other places to go look for answers. 

Appreciate the suggestions.

Oh, and because I know it's the first question I'd ask, I'm not sure how much of a reduction I'm looking for in dB. Because the mic clips every time I put weight on it (trying to track walking/movement patterns,) I don't know what it's actually peaking at. An incremental system (ie, add this much resistance to reduce amplitude by 3 dB, this much squared for 6dB, etc.) would be ideal, but anything would be appreciated. Of course, the mic peaking whenever there's weight on it isn't a terrible thing, I just want to get a less binary picture of the gait.

I currently have a Sony STR-SL7 receiver (circa 2001) which is a basic 80Wx5 home theatre receiver and it looks pretty good ... slim and silver.

http://esupport.sony.com/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=STRSL7

I'm using a pair of old Mirage m290 speakers (circa 1992) which are still in very good condition and still sound great.

I'm thinking about buying something cool and new.  I was considering the NAD C 316BEE receiver because it's very slim and is supposed to sound great.  Thing is, I visited a stereo store and was a little disappointed by it's finish and the feel of the knobs.  (The finish and knobs on the much more expensive NAD M3 were fantastic.)

Can anyone suggest something in an elegant, sexy, slim and simple integrated amplifier that will sound great and look cool?  

Also, I might consider adding a centre channel speaker eventually, so if there's a receiver you'd suggest, that could help too (although I'll never hook up surround speakers).

Speaking of speakers, I could be talked into replacing the old Mirage speakers with something in a cool, stylish new pair of bookshelf speakers; or maybe a pair of slim understated floorstanding speakers.

Any suggestions from you audiophiles would be greatly appreciated!

Hi guys,

I have two buddies who are big into installing custom audio stuff in cars. **FRIEND ONE**: telling me a skinny wire is fine to power an amp (for example) from the car battery, **FRIEND TWO** saying that it's very important you have a thicker gauge for this because of ""current"" etc - and showed me how my wire was already melting a bit.

My budget is about $50 with $60 being the absolute roof. Did a bit of searching and these are the ones I found I might like and are generally well reviewed.

- Audio-Technica ATH-M30 ($47)

- Sony MDR-XB500 ($50)

- JVC HARX900 ($55)

- Sennheiser HD515 ($55)

I listen to A TON of different music styles, everything from rock to pop to rap to metal to trance to industrial to dubstep to classical.

I'm thinking of going with the ATH-M30's, just because they seem to have pretty solid reviews and fit well within my price range. I'd like some M50's but like I said it's just too far out of my range. Here are the things most important to me:

- Sound range (ie: good bass, mids, and treble). No skimping on any one of them. I'm no audiophile but I can tell when something should have more bass or mids.

- Quality. I can be a klutz sometimes so I need something that can take the occasional drop to the floor or unexpected unplug.

- Comfort. I know this is tricky with circumaural headphones since they're so big and I hear they can get hot after a while so basically all I'm looking for is something that doesn't squeeze my head or mash my ears into smaller-than-they-should-be cups.

Everything else like isolation and portable I don't really care about. I'm only using these at my desk for most likely shorter periods of time (ie: under 2 hours).

- 5.1 surround sound setup, ideally that I can use with my turntable as well (can be flexible on this if it puts me over budget though)
- blu-ray DVD player

I understand these are, from my amateur opinion and research, that they are fairly high level headphones, I do listen to alot of music and would like to have high-grade headphones.

Also, if you know of any regular earbuds that insert into your hears so they fit snugly that are superior quality, please list them, as my pair recently broke. Noise cancelling on both the headphones and earbuds are highly preferred.

Now the headphones I purchase don't need to be one of the three I listed, if you have any recommendations for an avid music listener, please list them here. My budget would be hopefully under $100.

On an unrelated note, I'm debating between a 32 GB Ipod Touch and a 64 GB, as well as 4th vs 5th generation. Black is the only color I will purchase.

1. Buying a gadget (such as the [Super USB Cassette Capture](http://www.amazon.com/Cassette-Converter-Capture-Player-Headphones/dp/B007WSGA98). The Super USB Cassette Capture is quite affordable but has very mixed reviews. Have any of you tried this approach? Do you know of better adapters? 

2. Using an outline from a cassette player and connecting it to the in line of a computer, using audacity. And here is where my stupidity shines: Are in-lines common on laptops and how do I identify? I have a MacBook Pro which I think only has an out-line. I also have access to a Lenovo laptop but I'm not sure if there's an in-line there either. I do not have access to a stationary, where I suspect that they are more common. 

3. I'm not sure if seperate tracks are necessary, though it'd be ideal. Is this hard to do with programs such as audacity? How do I get a low enough file size to burn the track(s) to CDs?

They both have the same size drivers and AV40's have a slightly larger tweeter, and the OS' have go a little lower (45hz vs 85hz). The AV's do have the benefit of being self-powered (20 watts).

I like the idea of the DIY speaker project but I already own the AV40's and I'm not sure what to expect in quality in comparison, if it would be an upgrade. Price wise they were both at the ~120 mark, but for the OS's I'd have to pick up a small amp for them.

Google got me as far as learning that using speakers with less impedance than the amp is a bad idea.

Is there a solution to working with these speakers, or do I need to scavenge a new pair?  The math for AC signals is way different than the DC math I'm used to, but I'm wondering if either of the following will work:

1) Wire the two 6 ohm speakers in series to produce a single 12 ohm channel, then scavenge a single 12 ohm speaker as the second channel.

2) Add a power resistor to each channel to increase the speaker resistance over 6 ohms.

I know little to nothing about speakers... should I test these?  How do I test them, I know enough to do an Ohms test with a multimeter....

I really don't have a use for them, do I sell them?

2) Can I connect my DENON UD-M30 to my subwoofer?

A friend said the same thing happened to him and that he uses an ungrounded cable for his PC and this has solved the issue for him. I couldn't find one to purchase anywhere, so I'll have to get it from him to see if that fixes the issue. Until then I thought I'd ask you guys for suggestions.
The issue happens with both the on-board soundcard and my Steinberg U22. A power conditioner has not solved the issue either.

I've been considering making my own ungrounded cable by simply removing the ground from an extra power cable I have. Is this safe? I'd still be plugging it into a power surge.
