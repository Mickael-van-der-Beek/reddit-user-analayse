What is my professional expertise? Well, none really. Most of my thoughts about dating come from personal experiences, talking to people about their relationships, and a lot of observing. I'm in grad school now and work as an intern therapist with youth and their families. I also have an interest in working with people around their relationship issues, so maybe I'll do something with that after I've graduated. 

I'm not a regular on Reddit, so I'm not really sure how this AMA is going to work. This forum is not huge, so I'm thinking I'll answer questions for 48 hours or so, off and on. That means you can ask anything until Friday evening, PST. I think that about covers it.

You always hear the same things, and to me they don't have much basis in reality.

&gt; Get hobbies and work out

I play in two bands, and I have worked out for years. I am alone. 

It's not like people suddenly throw themselves at you when you are in shape or doing your hobbies. You still have to have the confidence to approach people and talk to them. I might be good at my hobby, but how is that supposed to give me confidence with women? It's a seperate thing. 

&gt; Learn to like yourself. Confidence comes from within.

I do like myself. So what?That doesn't give me confidence with women. Confidence comes from being actually good at something.

Do people really think your hobbies give you confidence with the opposite sex? Like I should be confident with women, because I'm good at guitar? They are not related. How crazy would it sound if someone said 'you should be confident with guitar playing, because women are attracted to you'.

&gt; Just ask her out, what have you got to lose?

Theoretically, nothing. She's already not dating me, so who cares if she says no? The difference is when you already feel unattractive, you don't want something adding to it. It just pushes you further down the low self-esteem spiral. I understand it's good to challenge your negativity, but it's still a risk.

&gt; 'hello' is the best opening line

Anyone who has said this has never actually tried just saying hello to someone, and getting stared at like a crazy person. 'Hello' is just the start of a sentence, you have to actually say something.

&gt; Girls like sensitive guys

No, they like guys who are sensitive to *them*. I'll go and stand in a crowded bar, crying. Let's see how many women hit on me. Ok to be fair I have never done that, but I think I have a pretty good idea of how it would go down..

&gt; Nice guys finish last, try being an asshole

I think sometimes when people say this, they mean 'be confident'. But then why not just say 'be confident?' I can't be 'be an asshole' any more than I can 'be french' or 'be italian'. I can only be what I am.

I realise this isn't very constructive, but I just wanted to get that out of my system. This is all in my personal experience of course, I'm sure for some it's different.

Self post too, so no karma.

It's been a full year. One full year in the making since I started this track for self-improvement.  A year ago I was socially clueless and embarrassing with women. I was consistently friend-zoned and felt that women simply weren't attracted to me. I had little confidence. I didn't know how to act around others and Hollywood defined how I viewed relationships. I was a Classic Forever Alone Nice Guy. I sent my crush a dozen cupcakes ï»¿*after* I told her my feelings for her and her rejecting me. It's difficult to believe that I actually thought that would be a good idea.

Truth is, I had a [Forever Alone mindset](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/05/10/forever-alone-is-a-mindset/). I thought that I was never good enough to have a relationship with a woman. Who would want to be with me? Seriously, who? I was 22 years old and never had a girlfriend. Couple random and weird one-night stand stories I could count on one hand at best. But no one would actually want to be *with* me. I graduated college in May 2011 with nothing to show for it--feeling like I completely wasted my college experience. That summer was my lowest point. Summer 2011 where I spent countless hours in /r/ForeverAlone where I felt I belonged. A circle jerk of self-pity and blame. A negative reinforcement cycle. I'd sit there and post about how girls always went for jerks, but shunned Nice Guys like me. I was lonely and depressed but I was comfortable. Very comfortable. Loneliness *was* the comfort zone. I finally found others like me.

Then, at the beginning of October 2011, several things happened in the span of a week that would be the eventual catalyst for this one year journey of self-improvement. 

First, the girl I was crushing on at the time blew off my dinner date I had been really looking forward to. 

The second thing that happened was, I came across this [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Ixzp94ksw&amp;list=SPC4EA12B1DE96F05E&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plpp_video). This video blew my mind. If these guys can pull this off, why can't I? What are they doing that I'm not doing? I was so inspired by this video that I called up two of my friends to come out with me while I approached as many girls at bars as I could. This was my ""first"" night out. And Oh My God was it a horror show. The amount of rejection I faced in that single night was enough to crush a man's soul to oblivion and never bring it back. I detailed the night [here](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/01/20/got-blown-out-by-15-girls-in-one-night/). The one advantage I had is my willpower which is quite strong. Since I convinced myself that it was possible because of that Youtube video, I became determined to become good with women.

I told my boss what happened with that night and then he told me about this book called The Game that he'd been reading. Shortly after that, I found the /r/seduction subreddit. I started reading The Game and dove into all of this material. I was like a sponge, soaking everything in. My mind being blown to pieces with every post I read. I felt like I had been doing everything wrong. *Everything*. 

The first month consisted of me just reading absolutely everything and then testing it out ""in the field"". I asked /r/seduction bunch of questions about this and that or whatever, looking for advice. I tried to memorize as many routines and openers and familiarized myself with all of the PUA lingo. I thought I could approach my problem scientifically and methodically. As it turns out, it's not that simple. After I started to get everything going, I was having mixed results. Most girls would totally blow me off, but a few would stick around and have a conversation with me. This was all new as I'd never done anything like this before. But I felt I was making progress in a few short weeks. I felt comfortable that I could approach someone with a canned routine and have all these little games to play to keep her entertained. More importantly though, in hindsight, I began to notice a pattern with my brain. The mental state I was in would have a direct impact on any success I had. It wouldn't matter what I said or to who, if I had those Forever Alone thoughts, I would fail, go home feeling lonely and depressed. But at the same time, I felt like I was getting better with each approach I'd make. It wasn't until the 31st, Halloween night, when I went out alone, did I begin to believe that being successful with women would be possible for me. That story is [here](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/01/28/halloween-night-first-successful-cold-approach/). I am forever grateful to that first crucial month that began the track for where I am today.

The next two months were quiet. I read a lot of books that were a complete waste of my time. All I did was try to memorize routines and have some kind of answer to every possible response a girl would have. I spent too much time on /r/seduction thinking that they had all the answers that I needed. In reality, many of the people in /r/seduction had no idea what they were talking about. It was bro-science. Who can tell the best ""field reports"" and all these other cock battles. Occasionally there would be a good post in there, but most of the time, I was chasing red herrings. I had only gotten a handful of numbers in those first 3 months and I felt I had hit a wall in my progress. These so-called ""routines"" would only get me so far. I would find I would run out of 'material' and have to rely on myself to keep a conversation going. As 2011 was coming to a close, I realized I needed to change tactics. Shift away from routines and 'classic game' to simply focus on becoming an awesome person. Thought I'd finally check this stuff out called ""inner game"". How could this ""inner game"" concept help me if it didn't tell me what to say to a girl?

The most important book I've read above all else was No More Mr. Nice Guy. It really was the wake-up call that I needed. It's a must read for any Classic Forever Alone Nice Guy. I then read the Definitive Book of Body Language and watched Tyler Durden's Blueprint Decoded series. All having huge impact on how I viewed the world. It became less about routines and more about the reality in which I lived. [See list of my favorite books here](http://www.shakedownlab.com/books-and-resources/).

The next 6 weeks I began having real significant success, scoring my first Same-Night Kiss close on Christmas Eve. Kissed my old crush (the one who I sent cupcakes to) at the ball drop on New Years Eve, and kissed a girl I met at a bar where I went to watch an NFL playoff game. These three success stories are posted [here](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/02/02/3-success-stories/). My confidence was at an all time high.

It was around this time that I became disillusioned with /r/seduction. I was upset that I had wasted two months early in my self improvement. I felt that the subreddit was not conducive to absolute, pure beginners like me. What I needed was a step-by-step approach for what books to read and what things to practice so that I wouldn't go off on these unnecessary red herrings. There was too much information and it was too daunting for Forever Alones. So I decided to create /r/faimprovement ...A kind of stepping stone for Forever Alones who would want to improve themselves like I did. I put a list of the crucial books I had read up to that point in the subreddit and it had garnered a few hundred subscribers. The creation of /r/faimprovement was received mostly well. I didn't know what I was going to do with it...Just kind of use it as a diary where I'd post updates for what I learned, etc. (/r/seduction content has been significantly improved over the last several months as there is a sort of shift towards inner game (though the tide might be turning again))

The rest of February and most of March was marked by getting a bunch of girls' numbers and a few failed first dates. But progress was steady. I read Magic Bullets, The Red Queen, Why Men Don't Have a Clue, and The Way of the Superior Man (most important here). All excellent books. 

I was kind of used to going out alone, and so I did again. This time for the [Mad Men Season 5 Premiere](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/03/26/went-out-alone-to-a-bar-for-the-mad-men-season-5-premiere-awesome-night-got-her-number/). Got this girl's number. I asked her out and I had my first **successful** [First Date and got her back to my place](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/04/02/went-on-the-date-got-her-back-to-my-place-and/). It was a great moment. I hadn't had sex in a very long time. So it took about 6 months from ground 0 to getting a successful date and a girl in my bed. 

We began dating exclusively. I will consider her my first real girlfriend ever. However, I could tell from the onset that there were going to be some problems. She was a very different person than I was. And not to say that that is a dealbreaker, it's just that we really didn't have anything in common at all. But most importantly was her attitude towards life. It was very depressing and sad. I needed someone who was uplifting, fun to be around, and *radiated energy*. I decided to [end it after 6 weeks of dating](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/05/16/just-dumped-the-girl-i-was-seeing/). This was a learning experience in its own right and needed to happen. I knew what I wanted out of a girl and I knew that I was capable of finding it. I wouldn't just settle for the sake of having a girlfriend.

**1. WHAT IS A ""NICE GUY""?**

&gt; **bash.org:**

&gt; A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

This reasoning right here is the epitome of ""Nice Guy"" thinking.

Basically a ""Nice Guy"" is someone who wonders why if they are so nice and good to women, why they won't reciprocate (sleep with them)? The reason is: because they don't have to, and no force in the world can change that. Let's now get into the nitty-gritty of what's wrong with being a ""Nice Guy"" (hereafter referred to as an NG).

Some quotes that are helpful:

&gt; **Vulvarine posted:**

&gt; I think it's really important to distinguish between niceness and kindness. *Kindness is a real, positive, desirable trait in a romantic partner. Niceness is just the ability to be inoffensive.* Most women who don't like ""nice guys"" are perfectly affable toward kind men as a dateable group.

    
&gt; **Ionic posted:**

&gt; One of the keys to understanding the Nice Guy vs. the clueless innocent is that the Nice Guy's definition of himself as such is usually the result of repeated romantic failure and a resulting, crippling bitterness. The clueless innocents eventually bumble their way out of that stage. That's the difference. 

&gt; I don't want to make this into more than it is, but I think many men fail to grasp exactly how uncomfortable and, potentially, vulnerable a woman can feel in the face of persistent attention, flattery, and the like. 

&gt; It flies in the face of years and years of social conditioning to tell an outwardly ""nice"" man - one who has in no way technically threatened, harassed, or intimidated you - to ""get the fuck away, I'm not interested."" It's one thing to tell off the drunk who's trying to cop a feel on the subway (and even that isn't always easy). But rejecting the friend who just won't stop hanging around looking for more? It's not a simple situation.

&gt; So, many women just don't do it. Especially confident and assertive women can do it easily, but even a woman without self-esteem problems could understandably find it difficult to be ruthlessly direct in that situation. All too often, we opt for subtlety instead.

&gt; And that's where the real problem with Nice Guys comes in. A regular guy would get the hint, see it as a matter of compatibility and not take it personally, then move on to someone more likely to return his interest. A Nice Guy, on the other hand, will stick around and attempt to wear you down.  Often Nice Guys will pursue ""'hard luck' cases"" - women who are perhaps not the best-prepared to stand up for themselves. 

&gt; And in the end, if the Nice Guy doesn't get what he wants? He invents a scenario that makes his wasted effort a noble quest to overcome (what he tells himself) is his target's shitty taste in men. Because admitting that he wasted his time pushing for something that was clearly never going to happen is just plain cognitively uncomfortable. 

&gt; To sum up, the ""perfect storm"" that goes into creating a self-described Nice Guy is a mix of a sense of entitlement, a mark who is too kind and/or passive to outright reject the NG, and the NG's persistence in the face of what many other individuals would recognize as subtle signals of mark's disinclination to mate. 

* **1.1 Manipulation**

NG behaviour is manipulative. NGs basically do everything they can to 'make' someone fall for them in an underhanded way. It makes every ""nice"" act revolve around the ulterior goal of getting with 'that' girl. They do it so hard that it becomes a second nature and they're not even conscious of it.

* **1.2 Unrealistic objectification**

NG behaviour ultimately reduces women to objects. While they would vehemently deny it, NGs project all their romantic fantasies on one (or sometimes multiple, or successive) girls, which blinds them to the fact that these women are independent people. 

* **1.3 Dishonesty**

NGs are not nice for the sake of being nice. They're nice because they think they'll get something in return. Granted that many people behave that way, but the Nice Guy often has a particularly bad case of this, which sometimes even veers straight into a type of co-dependency or creates a massive entitlement complex.

* **1.4 It doesn't work**

Most women and many men can sense that you're a ""Nice Guy"", and think it's creepy. Also, it plain just doesn't work. Even if you insist on having some sort of mathematical formula for ""women like X, Y and Z so if I do that, I'll get laid"", the Nice Guy Technique has appalling success rates.

* **1.5 ""Ugh, women always end up dating douches""**

Nobody likes assholes, and any women who says she prefers ""bad boys"" past age 25 is probably sort of broken herself. *However, most women who end up with guys that have glaring flaws don't date them because of their flaws. They end up dating them/sleeping with them because they are self-confident, have interesting stuff to say, are attractive or act like actual people instead of a scripted doormat.* Also, maybe her SO is acting hostile towards you because he can sense your true motives. 

* **1.6 Passiveness**

One particular reason why the ""friendship"" between an NG and their 'one true love' or whatever is shallow and questionable is that NGs typically don't go in against their object's opinions (unless their position is threatened somehow), even if these are wrong or questionable. It's pretty passive at best and sycophantic at worst.

* **1.7 ""I am nice""**

NGs often describe themselves as being ""nice"", and oddly enough, so do many people around them. Well, if the first thing that comes up in your mind, or in others' if you need to be described, is ""nice"", then you have a problem because it means you're not particularly seen as having personality.


**2. TYPICAL NICE GUY EXCUSES**

* **2.1 ""But I am genuinely a friend.""**

If you are, then why are you moping how girls only ""want you as a friend""? Also, a variant of this excuse is NGs who go out of their way to not do anything or act on their feelings as long as their object of desire is in a relationship, but prefer pining in the shadows, bottling up massive frustrations.

* **2.2 ""But in that movie/novel...""**

Popular culture tends to feed the idea that the NG thing is somehow cute, worth empathising with or even truly romantic. Like so many clichÃ©s about love and relationships in pop culture, it couldn't be further from the truth. Pop culture loves exploiting NGs because it tugs on a few heart strings and is good for drama. It doesn't make this sort of behaviour mentally healthy or advisable, and if you're going to take dating advice from pop culture, well, then I don't know what to say.

* **2.3 ""If she doesn't like it, why doesn't she say anything about it?""**

Nice guys make an advance that cannot be rejected in a socially acceptable way. If a guy says, ""Hey, how about a date?"", then it's perfectly socially acceptable to say, ""Nah, I'm not interested."" But instead he might say, ""Oh, you're moving? I'd love to help. When? Hmm, I'm working that day, but I can call out sick. It's really no problem! I don't own a truck, but I could rent one of those ones from the Home Depot."" Is this guy really helpful just generally, or is there some subtext there of him trying to impress you? Should you say, ""That would be really helpful, but since I am not attracted to you, I am honor-bound not to accept your offer of assistance""? Of course not. So you don't say it, and then there's this weird THING sort of hanging in the air in your dealings with that person in the future. You're like 85% sure that he's into you, but every time he has an opportunity to actually say it, he passes it up. Eventually, you relax a little, and then one day one of your dumber girlfriends lets on in front of this guy that you have car trouble. You try to hiss at her or step on her foot or something, but you're too slow or she's too clueless, and his eyes brighten. ""Can I look at it? I'd be happy to help!"" Ugh.

* **2.4 ""Welp, guess I should become an asshole then!""**

Apart from being a non-argument/false dichotomy (it's not one or the other), in fact, NGs are already assholes, but with a mask of niceness. You can certainly be a nice person without the deeper layers of manipulation, self-pity and self-entitlement.

**3. HOW TO SNAP OUT OF BEING A ""NICE GUY""**

* **3.1** Realise that the world doesn't owe you anything, and by extension, women don't owe you anything merely because you're ""nice"" for all the wrong reasons.

* **3.2** Stop being a passive-aggressive doormat and be more candid about your desires. This will mean having to take rejection, too.

* **3.3** Don't pine. Realise that there are many, many potentially compatible partners that you could have while wasting time on projecting your romantic fantasies onto someone who will never reciprocate.

* **3.4** Realise that there is no ""manual"" to women, no guaranteed rules, etc. If you're autistic or have a bad case of the 'sperg, seek therapy.

Lastly, one thing I want to make clear is that ""Nice Guys"" aren't necessarily cold-hearted manipulators. The overwhelming majority of Nice Guys probably aren't even aware that their reasoning and what they're doing is flawed and disrespectful.

It starts with men simply being intimidated by women. Many of these guys don't know how to effectively approach women and they aren't assertive or interesting, so they fall back on the fairy tale script that ""as long as I'm an amazing and great friend who is always there for her, she'll eventually see how wonderful I am and we'll live happily ever after, etc. etc."" It's pathetic and undesirable, but not necessarily malicious.

It's when this plan fails again and again, that frustration and resentment builds up and the guy begins to think that he's entitled to a woman's love as a transaction for being the target of his affection and care. He isn't aware of the sick flaw in his reasoning because in his mind it's innocuous: ""I'm a nice guy, why don't women like me?"" and ""It's so true, nice guys do finish last."" But he really does behave as though a woman's rejection is a breach of contract. The Nice Guy is delusional and wrong, just not consciously so.

So that's the purpose of the OP: to serve as a wake up call for all the well-intentioned but misguided ""Nice Guys"" who aren't conscious of what they're really doing.

I've taken a lot of drastic steps to improve how I feel about myself and I'd like to share some of them with you all.

I grew up in a really small and racist town.  I was the only Indian kid (dot not feather!!) and even the parents of my close friends didn't realize the impact of what they would say.  I remember a friends (white) mother saying to me ""Don't you think it's disgusting when the races mix?"".  So I was always in a bit of a fragile place.  

Anyway, HS wasn't a great time for me and I ended up breaking off with all of my friends and going to college way out of state.  My first year was horrible, I went from scholarship to academic probation and made maybe 2 friends.  I was a loner, and very self-conscious a nervous when meeting new people.

My second year I decided that something had to change.  So what I did was the following:

1) I joined the residence hall government.
2) I sold candy grams in the dorm lobby.
3) I made a rule for myself that whenever I'm in an elevator with another person, I MUST talk to them.
4) Every day at the university bus stop, I would approach and talk to a new person.
5) If someone invited me out, I MUST GO.

It was really rough, sometimes people just don't want to talk.  I got just about every bad response you could possibly get.  I also learned how to talk to people.  I learned little things, like people love hearing the sound of their own name.  Or that most people really enjoy talking about themselves.  

Fast forward a few years later and I moved to a new city for a job.  I knew literally 0 people in town and Atlanta isn't an especially easy place to meet new people.  To meet people, I did a few things:

1) Joined an asian professional organization. Everyone at a prof. organization is there to network.  Easy way to meet a lot of people.
2) Joined amateur sports league.  I joined ALTA tennis league in Atlanta at a fairly low level.  The administrators matched with a team at my skill level in town.  Most of the time we'd go for dinner/drinks after practice a matches.  Great way to meet new people
3) Went out alone.  Some days you just have to do it.  
4) Went to meetups - these were mostly a bust, Atlanta is a not a great meet-up town

Anyway, I guess this is just a random list of things I did, but it really helped a lot.  I met a girl that I dated for several months at a 4th of July house party a coworker invited me to.  I got to the part several hours before my coworker and even then it was just fine.  I'll never forget a conversation we had:

Her: ""I never date guys like you""
Me: ""Really?  Why did you decide to come out with me?""
Her: ""You just seemed so relaxed and confident""

That's really what it was all about.  I am not an especially good (or bad) looking guy.  I'm a horrible dancer, I'm a horrible singer.  I'm also the kind of person that takes steps to fix my problems.  I took salsa classes for 4 months.  I still suck at dancing, but at least I'm not nervous about it any more.

TL;DR - Keep putting yourself in uncomfortable situations.  Recognize that things will often go ""wrong"" before they stat going ""right"".

Last night I was sitting in my hotel room bored, on a business trip in a major city. I looked at the clock and it was about 10:30 pm. I said to myself ""fuck this, I'm at least going to walk around outside"". So I walked around a little and ended up going in a random bar I came across. I had just sat down and ordered a cider, when literally about 30 seconds later a group of 3 girls came over. I simply said to them ""is this the place to be tonight?"" with a silly looking smirk on my face, and we all ended up talking for about 20 minutes. They were a few years younger than me.

I started saying things I never would have considered just a few months ago when I was FA, before I started reading this subreddit and Shakedown's material. First I said they should all buy me a shot. They laughed. Then I made fun of myself for drinking a ""girly drink"", and at the same time busted on them for drinking water. The most attractive of the 3 started asking me questions, and I told her ""I audit trillion dollar companies""... a bit of a stretch but she had a good laugh. She was nervously playing with her hair while we talked (I wish I had thought to tease her about this!) When other guys would hit on them, I'd just turn back to the bar and start drinking/chatting to the bartender. The girls stayed around where I was sitting the entire time I was there.

Finally I ran out of cider and they were leaving shortly, so I had to make an executive decision...how to proceed. I turned around in my barstool and told the cute girl with glasses that ""we should hang out next week"". She simply said that she wasn't going to be in town then. I said nice to meet you all and headed out. Upon leaving the bar, I started kicking myself in the ass for not hitting on the most attractive girl more ... she seemed to be most into me out of the 3!

The thing that sucked the most for me was thinking of the 4,125 different things I COULD have said/done ... not at all because I was nervous, but simply because I hadn't thought of them! My whole point is if you're ever debating with yourself between staying inside and going out, always go out. Even by yourself. You never know what could happen. And don't plan anything, just wing it!

That vid showed me how receptive women my age are to an attempt to get their number.

So, I was over at the bakery looking for something quick to eat for breakfast when I saw this really pretty cashier. That's when I told myself that I gotta go for it. She was exactly my type.

I went over to check out my scone and when she told me my price, I mumbled a compliment out of nervousness.

She goes, ""What was that, sir""

That's when I knew I had to go balls to the wall and be direct. I said, ""Hey, you're really cute.""

She's slightly taken aback but thanks me with a smile. Then we exchange names  and I say, ""I know you're really busy right now and can't talk so let me get your number so we can get to know each other""

She quickly writes her number on a business card and hands me it with an embarrassed smile. I promise to text her when she gets off and leave the venue.

That's the first time I've ever done something like that. I know it isn't much and I probably made a billion mistakes but I finally started after months of watching other people on the internet do it. 

I sent her a text a few hours ago and hopefully she'll reply. But fuck it, if she doesn't, I'll just try to come off as more confident and safe with the next girl I approach.

It may not be the change that makes everything in my life suddenly change in one day, but it is a start and it is a small step to where I want to get to. I'm not trying to completely change myself. I never want to leave my true self, but improve and work on getting out of this ""forever alone"" mentality, suppress my depression and low self-esteem.

I thought it would help me, as I feel less than confident to talk to random people to start making the friends. (This does not mean I am a bad conversationalist, but I could improve) 

I began with the No more Nice Guy book reading it all on a lazy Saturday. Albeit this book seemed insightful of the nice guy syndrome, I believe I have pulled myself out of that syndrome within the past year. That in and of itself was a good sign as I knew I was on this path before finding this subreddit. 

The biggest change recently was when I began the How to talk to Anyone book! I had read a quarter of the book when I decided to go out and try out some of the methods with people I interacted with running my errands! I have always dreaded the conversation with the barber, but determined to test these tips the book had, I went in for a meaningful conversation. **IT WORKED BRILLIANTLY**. Not only did I have a good conversation, at the end of the haircut, the lovely older lady asked me how old I was, and was astonished when I told her 23 as she said I composed myself as a 50 year old professional. She gave me half off my haircut, because she said she had the best time with me today than she had in a while with her clients. I walked out looked up at the sky and said âWhat the hell just happened?â Even smaller interactions with cashiers, and people in general have been more fun for me. 

I was having breakfast with a family member telling him about this book when this intimidating black man came up to us to ask us if anything was alright in typical manager fashion. I ended up chatting with him about the end of the world (since it was 12/21) and he opened up about his life by the end of the short chat. My brother looked at me, and instantly saw this was for the real deal. 

Seeing as its family time with Christmas tomorrow, I havenât gotten the chance to just go out on my own and chat with some stranger at a bar yet. I am going to soon! I already have the weekend to do the big blow out day where I ask out the 10 girls and get rejected (still a bit nervous on that one, but itâs January 19-21st during a short trip to see an old friend) This gives me time to just talk to people around a couple bars to hone in on the skills. 

Merry Christmas to all of you guys out there! Hopefully, you all are seeing the small successes in your self-improvement as well!

**TL:DR**: My self-improvement has begun!

- those who have this problem, but understand the philosophies behind the second attitude. They just have trouble continuously thinking that way.

So I'm a 24 year old guy that literally has had little to no social growth since high school.

I grew up with a fucked up opinion of women from my parents (My dad is a womanizing asshole that manipulates my mom and can't tie himself down to one woman, my mom takes it and deals with it.)  Generally I put girls on pedestals and treat them like royalty.  I didn't think my parents had anything to do with this but now that I got dumped by a girl and looked at my own thought patterns, I fucking get it now, and it makes me nauseous that I put some poor girl through that shit.  I'm actually glad she decided to stop seeing me, because she's a confident incredible person that doesn't deserve to be chained to a guy like me who's stuck in giant depression pit.

Seriously, it's fucking pathetic.  The thought of being like my dad sickens me.

Lets not mistake shit here, I'm not a ""Nice Guy"".  Yes I do value myself below a lot of people I find attractive, but I don't expect sex or anything scummy like that.  Seriously, I think that shit is disrespectful and creepy.  All I've ever wanted was a connection with someone, as relationships are basically next level friendships that I don't fully understand.  I don't resent girls for not dating me, I generally hate myself for not being more likeable.  Honestly I wouldn't really date myself if I were another person.

So let's look at who I am now.  I'm almost 25, I work a shitty fucking job at a base level support desk helping retail employees not shit themselves, I've basically been single forever, and in general I'm a giant pussy.  I have an associate's degree that basically says I'm qualified to press buttons on a computer, and I don't have time to go back to school because I made the call to leave my parents' house before it fell apart beneath me.

I'm afraid of losing my job, because that means poverty.    I'll lose my car.  I'll lose my house.  I'll basically be no better off than my parents, except worse because I have zero backup.  So I suck it up and put up with the bullshit.  I pretty much want to take my phone and huck it across the room, and smash my computer into pieces and walk out.
My boss is a dick that gets bent out of shape if you're 2 minutes late.  It's increasingly annoying, and stressful for what I get out of it.

I hate going out alone to things because I feel isolated.  I pretty much get looked over and ignored when I go out, and I pretty much feel like nothing.  It's not something I enjoy a lot.  I generally become a more interesting and better person when drunk, and people find me more entertaining and enjoyable because I stop giving a shit.  But as I sober up, the anxiety comes back, and the paralyzing fear creeps in.

My hair isn't cut because I don't care, I have a gut because I don't care.  My hair is thinning as I get older and it terrifies me.  I don't like myself, and I feel painted into a corner because of previous life choices.  I can't afford a therapist, my debt load isn't going anywhere and I'm pretty much stuck in place being a mediocre shitfest of garbage.  I'm sick of it.

I honestly shouldn't be dating because I can't afford it.  I can't afford to go out to clubs, nor do I want to.  I could go to bars all the time but drinks are fucking expensive and I don't feel like making an ass of myself alone.

I can't even afford therapy, and the last few times I tried to reach out  it went nowhere.

I just don't know where to turn or what to do.  I live in a decent sized city.  I've pretty much let low self esteem and depression push me all the way down to the bottom, allowing me to create this thick layer of numbness to where I don't find anything interesting anymore.  I just want to sit and stare at my screen, because what's the point?

I feel like disappearing from everyone I've known and basically nuke my life from orbit, cutting ties with everything and starting over.  Deleting my presence online, changing my number, and just disappearing.  But I'm almost certain that if I did this I would fail.

I don't want to be me anymore.  It's tiring, exhausting, and terrible.  I don't know how to fix it though.

This rant is probably disjointed and weird, but I need to fix this and I have no idea what to do.  I'm just fucking tired, and if I could go to sleep and never wake up I'd probably be fine.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_1h2teb,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1h2teb/you_know_what_fuck_this_garbage/,

It's not terribly unique, but I think my perspective is, to a certain extent.

I'm a scrawny nerd with social anxiety disorder, depression, body dismorphic disorder and neediness issues. I'm 30, and I haven't gotten laid since I was 18. But I think I've found the most direct path to strong personal confidence: Raising your testosterone.

---

Here's my observation: I've lurked on /r/seduction for a while now and you can easily find thread upon thread upon thread of PUAs trying to convince AFCs how to have better inner game by just ""explaining"" that mental state, on this subreddit. Personally I think it's just a huge waste of time trying to ""think"" your way to more confidence. That is obvious. The less obvious part is what to do instead.

I've only been lifting for around 2 months now, and while my physical results are still small, my mental results have suddenly become very noticeable. I've started become more aggressive with my friends, starting saying things without worry of repercussions. I still battle depression, but I'm not as self-deprecating as I was before. I started wondering about this, and I realized that it's not the aesthetics that gives you confidence, but the boost in testosterone!

I started researching this a bit over the past couple of weeks. I found shit-loads of good articles that relate the effects testosterone has on depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, etc, etc. I'm not going to dump a bunch of links on you. I'm just going to point out one really good paper that summarizes recent research and highlight the points it made. The more academic minded can read that paper and nit-pick any mistakes I made, but I think the conclusion is fairly obvious.

**The role of testosterone in social interaction**

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5317066/2011-eisenegger-role-testosterone-social-interaction.pdf

(I used the page numbers in the lower-right corner)

**Dominance**: In contrast to the controversial role of testosterone in aggression, a mounting body of evidence in both animals and humans suggests that _testosterone drives a more general repertoire of motivated behaviors_, often subsumed under the concept of _dominance behavior_. [264]

**More Dominance**: Measurements of testosterone at a single time-point _correlate positively with high dominance_ in both adolescents and adults. [265]

**High Status**: Several recent studies suggest that testosterone facilitates particular social emotional mechanisms that tend to enhance the ability of an individual to achieve and maintain a _high social status_. [265]

**Not Giving a Fuck**: Humans are generally aware of, and concerned with, the emotions of others. In the competition for status, however, _this awareness might be detrimental_, as it could boost concern for the other party at the expense of oneâs own status drive. Thus, if testosterone facilitates status seeking, it is conceivable that it might _suppress emotion inference capacity_. [266]

**Maintaining Strong Eye Contact**: Recent results provide direct support for the hypothesis that _speed of gaze aversion_ from masked facial anger depends on self reported motives of dominance and submission. [266]

**Maintaining High Status**: Maintaining a high status position requires an increased sensitivity for aversive events and impending social threats, particularly those that challenge the high social status of an individual. As we show below, testosterone appears to be able to inï¬uence such processes; in particular, it appears to confer _high motivational drive_, _low fearfulness_ and _high stress resilience_, either directly or via interactions with other hormones and neurotransmitter systems. [267]

**Lower AA**: Several studies have shown that testosterone administration _reduces anxiety-like behavior_ in rodents in several behavioral paradigms, including the defensive burying test and the elevated plus maze. [â¦] In humans, single acute doses of testosterone have been shown to _reduce subconscious fear and fear potentiated startle_. Together, these results suggest that testosterone takes its effects on status seeking through _decreasing fear_. [269]

**Staying Calm**: A further important function of testosterone is its role in motivation; animal models have shown a tight link with the dopaminergic system within striatal areas. Thus, together with the ability to _reduce fear_ and _buffer stress responses_, testosterone might have a pivotal role in promoting upward movement in a status hierarchy by facilitating the engagement in a competition for status. [269]

None of this should come as a serious surprise. What _should_ be a surprise is that you can get all of this naturally, without having to ""fake it til' you make it"" or any of that other PUA philosophy nonsense that gets tossed around. Just hit the gym and I guarantee you any AFC will at least be more confident after 3 months of lifting, rather than 3 months of reading /r/seduction.

1356929073.0,27,self.faimprovement,15piqo,"How to be a nice guy and still get beautiful, successful, and committed women.",Silosobi,37,10,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/15piqo/how_to_be_a_nice_guy_and_still_get_beautiful/,"So I can relate to a lot of the sentiments in this forum.  I've had major issues with social anxiety, and felt very alone at times, but I have still managed to have relationships with some amazing girls.  I think there are a lot of genuinely good things about being a nice guy, you will never get lots of random pussy, but if you really are a nice guy you probably aren't interested in that.  I thought I would just give a few basic tips that I think have helped allow me to end up in good relationships:

1) Have interests outside of gaming.  We all wish that our amazing k/d ratio or apm would score chicks but its just a fact of life that it doesn't.  Gaming for many people becomes a fairly antisocial activity (I do think there is a lot of merit to online friends, but they wont have sex or a relationship with you, and girls tend to think gaming in excess is unattractive)  You still can and should do what you enjoy, but I think a lot of FA type people use gaming or other non-social activities to extreme levels, to the point where you are doing it to the exclusion of other things.  Maybe it started out that way just because it was so fun, but eventually most of us realize physical human contact is important.   So just find some other thing you enjoy and spend time doing it.  For me, I have a dog that I take on runs and to the dog park for 1-2 hours a day.  I already have a good relationship, but I meet lots of cute girls who seem to like me just because I have an attractive, well behaved dog.

2) Get in shape.  I'm not going to debate whether this is right or wrong or good or bad (I honestly dont believe in right and wrong).  The simple fact is girls (and everyone really) is influenced by our society and culture, which says strong, athletic men are attractive.  Its also just good for your health, which is a good reason to do it anyway.  You really don't have to be excessive about this.  At some point I just decided this was something I needed to do, and I started spending 5-10 minutes lifting weights before I shower every day, and running ~15-20 min around the block with my dog most days.  Its amazing how much difference that little bit can make if you keep up with it for a long time.  If you want faster results, you can put in more work to get it.

That's it.  You were probably waiting for some big revelation/secret, but these two things are really all you need.  If you are new to the relationship thing, you will probably fuck up the first few times, but that is just what everyone has to go through.  Once you have some experience you will understand better how to have a healthy relationship.  You can read/study all you want about how to do a relationship right, but IMO you just have to try it and feel things out.  Its different for everyone.

I should probably say something about fear of rejection, since its a big thing for FA people.  I had a lot of problems with this in my past, and its still not easy, but there is really no way to argue that fear of rejection is somehow healthy, or part of being a nice guy.  Its just one of those things you eventually have to do and get over.  Love and sex with a girl is well worth it.

TL;DR: If you want to get girls you should get in physical shape and care about things other than video games.  If you just leave your house and talk to girls (or with a lot of hobbies, like having a dog, they will just come talk to you), give them some idea that you are happy and have interests / things you care about, and you will eventually get a girlfriend.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_15piqo,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/15piqo/how_to_be_a_nice_guy_and_still_get_beautiful/,

Instead...,shakedown_st,29,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/rbdpf/do_not_unload_your_feelings_onto_her_instead/,"I need to make this post because I see an increasing amount of awful advice in [/r/foreveralone](/r/foreveralone) and other subreddits where some guy has been friendzoned by their crush and doesn't know what to do. So the hivemind in these subreddits say, ""tell her how you feel! tell her how much you love her and how much she means to you!"" and so on and so on... After all, in the movies, the girl is always like, ""Oh my God! I've been dating jerks all this time, but now I realize that you're the one I truly love, Derp! Of course we'll go out together!"" Lol. This actually doesn't happen in real life.

Now I'm sure you've all done this at one point or another. If you've read my posts, you know what happened 2 years ago when I did. Her natural reaction is to recoil immediately. The response you're going to get is, ""I'm kind of taken aback by this, Derp. I really only see you as a friend, and I hope we can remain friends"". This is reality.

You're in the friendzone, and you'd be *deluding yourself* if you think that by telling her how much you've loved her over the years, she would suddenly change her mind and want to date you. Think about that for one minute and ask yourself, ""Hmm, was that creepy?"" Yes, it was.

Unloading your feelings onto her simply does not work. It's a self-sabotage technique. **And on a deep, core level, you kind of know that it won't work, but you do it anyway.** This is part of being Forever Alone. It's that mindset that you deserve to be alone, so you'll actually sabotage your relationships, but in a way that makes you seem like a victim. Reality is, **you're being manipulative and self-serving.** But if you're here in [/r/faimprovement](/r/faimprovement) , you're obviously trying to change that. Good.

Okay, so hopefully you can see that telling her everything is a bad idea. But what if you absolutely can't live with yourself anymore and have to at least give it a shot with her? All or nothing, hail Mary! Well, instead of telling her, **demonstrate** through actions that you are interested in her. Find some activities to do together. Like take her out dancing, hiking, bars, picnics, ice skating, beach. Just the two of you. Start doing a lot of these little fun activities/dates together and the more time you spend with her, *increase physical contact* with her. Touch her a lot more than you used to. Women respond and are much more sensitive to touch than men. It's very powerful. Eventually, if you're holding hands, then you've broken through a huge wall and can escalate even more, perhaps, to a kiss.

Now the more you do of this, gauge her reactions. How is she responding? Is she receptive or is she pulling away? There will come a point where you'll have to accept if she is simply not willing to go any further with you and that's fine. At least you gave it a good attempt.

tl;dr: Telling her how much you love her is self-sabotage, doesn't work and only happens in the movies. Instead, take her out on dates and activities, showing her how much fun you are to be with, all the while escalating physical contact. She can take a hint.

I've had a crush on this girl we'll call A. We're two of the four people who answer questions in class on a regular basis so we kind of had a connection from that. She was also very attractive. I tried to sit as close to her as I could. We made serious eye contact when we did look at each other, which I think is a good sign. I finally got the courage to talk to her three weeks ago. I just made some comment about the class to her and she laughed and smiled and after class we introduced ourselves, ""I'm ericbn2011"", ""I'm A"" and we've done some small chitchat in class since.

But I wasn't satisfied. I wanted to see more of her after the class ended. So I decided to ask her to the UWM-NIU basketball game this Friday night. Unfortunately, I saw her planner and it said she had something to do on Friday night at the same time as the game. Luckily for me, there was a game tonight. So right before we left, I said, ""Hey A, I'm going to the UWM-Buffalo game tonight, do you want to come along?""

She smiles and says she would like to but she was working tonight but I could add her on Facebook. I said okay and took her name down. I then went to the UWM-Buffalo game (which we lost badly) without her and (tried to) enjoyed myself. Then I came back and added her.

I'm almost 40, disabled with brain damage, unemployed, over 100 lbs overweight, and live with my parents. I'm struggling to get a career started with some community college classes, but I've never had a real job -- just restaurant/retail stuff, off and on.

I had girlfriends, one after the other, until I was 22 and 1) got fat, 2) sustained my brain injury, and 3) reached that magical age where guys are expected to have jobs. I guess a couple of things (girls) have come up since then, but not many, and I screwed those opportunities up. But really, when I think back, I didn't even WANT to be in a relationship when I'm as screwed up as I am.

So really, objectively, I'm at the bottom of the barrel -- I'm like a 0, or a -10, or something like that. But, and I'm sure you can relate, I still have this accursed sex drive and loneliness. Mental disability doesn't take away the desire to work and love, but only the ability. So it's kind of a puzzle for any romantic method, I think, when you get someone who pretty much is just undatable, like me. I have never met a guy who is less attractive than myself.

Don't tell me this is just reflective of a ""can't do"" attitude, because it's backed up by failure after failure. But, I still have a glimmer of hope. Someday, something will change. And I have a glimmer of hope that I'll make this new career training work out and actually get a job, and then I can move out. And I'll be slender and middle class and with my own place, and at that point, maybe I can start attracting women again? Will that happen? It all feels very far away.

The reason i'm asking this is when we are feeling sorry for ourselves, we tend to exaggerate things and only see the bad. Its true things do seem to be getting harder, but are ""we"" being ridiculous? Help me see the light. Where do i meet women? Is it too late for us? 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1bz074/being_fa_in_your_late_20s/

&gt;At 26, it's fucking hard to meet new people. In your school years, you spend 7 hours a day in a social institution filled with individuals in your age group. It's literally impossible for you to not encounter hundreds or at least dozens of your peers on a daily basis. Maybe you didn't talk to them too much or even at all, but they were at least in the vicinity and you have the possibility for developing friendships or relationships.

&gt;College is basically four more years of the same thing, but without parents, so you're more free. You're still in a social institution with people your own age, but you can get out and do more stuff.

&gt;Then you graduate college. Half of your friends move away to get jobs. Most of those that haven't moved away, you lose touch with them because you aren't in school anymore and you don't see them every day. If you're lucky, the rest of them keep in touch and you at least still have a circle of friends. But what now? How do you replace those friends you lost? Work? I work with a bunch of people old enough to be my parents. I've worked here for 8 years, and it wasn't until December that they hired anyone remotely in my age group (actually she's just six months younger than me). The next-closest person is 7 years older than I am. It's not that I'd mind hanging out with a 33-34 year old coworker, but she's practically married and lives an hour away from the office, so no, we're not going to hang out outside of work. There are a couple who are about 10-12 years older, and they're married with young kids. The rest of them are pretty much at least in their late 40's. Nice people, but we're not talking about people who are just a little older here . . . it's a legitimate generation gap.
I don't know what else to do. Most of my friends work jobs with other people in their age group, but I don't. It's no wonder how they're able to continue meeting people. Personally, I really wonder if I'll ever make a new friend again, let alone whether I'll be able to find anyone that's available and interested in dating me.

so yeah POSTS like that. How do you counter that? It really feels like the pool of women just keeps shrinking, and i'm running out of time.

We texted back and forth Monday and Tuesday and then I didn't text her until Friday morning, the day of the date. Everything is going fine and I get to the meeting place. She texts me saying she's going to be late.

Now here is the difference between the current ""version"" of me and the version of me six months ago. Six months ago I would have responded, ""Oh, no worries, I'll be waiting here."" It's fine, but this is an opportunity to be cocky and funny. So instead, I respond with *""What's the rush? You got a hot date to get to?""* She loves it.

We are at our first location, drinking tea. She insists on sitting across from me which kind of throws off some of my plans. In body language, it's better to be sitting adjacent to the person or at a right angle. Sitting across is subconsciously a chess match. But I roll with it. The conversation starts to turn kind of depressing and she describes how upset she is with her current job and lack of prospects. This is not good. I see her closing up and I can't let this conversation continue. I need to take control and start talking about things that I want to talk about. I start talking about body language and she is loving it. I'm able to touch her and I talk about all the different kinds of handshakes. Magically, everything starts turning into my favor.

We move to our second location and drink beers there. She loves to talk so I let her. Then I tell some funny stories and lighten the mood. It's finally 2am and we have to leave. I think she planned this, because the buses were shut down and she says ""I'm going to walk home then."" which would be an hour walk. I said no way, ""you're coming with me."" ...""ok""

Awesome.

We get to my place and we talk for a while, but we finally settle in to bed together and start making out. Things escalate slowly, but surely. I will spare the *details*, but we have sex and it was absolutely amazing. This girl is a wildcat lol.

I think she really likes me, as I like her. She indicates that she wants to turn this into a relationship, but the issue is that she's 29 and I'm 23. So I don't know exactly what she's looking for. I guess we'll find out, but all I know is that last night was what all of this self improvement has been heading towards and it finally became a reality. **It was literally 6 months to the day since I picked up my first book and began reading about all of this stuff.**

Children approach playing games, or doing exercises or being given the chance to try something new, very differently from adults. Children approach these situations with one mission, and that mission is to have lots of turns. They sometimes actually rate their success that way, saying something like ""I had four turns and Charlie only had three--I win!""

Adults are very different. We want to sit back, assess--from our seats!--whether we'd be any good at the task in question. If we think we'd be successful at it, then and only then will we want a turn. If we think it is something we would not be good at, we would usually prefer to have no turn at all.

Children want lots of turns, but adults just want one perfect turn.

As adults, we've already decided what we're good at and what we're bad at, and we only want to have turns at things we're already good at. We've met lots of people who've told us they can't draw, but none of them was seven. All children think they're brilliant artists and want their drawings displayed on the refrigerator. As adults, even if we secretly think we can draw, we hide our sketches away under the bed: ""Don't look at those--they're just some silly things I was doodling."" The thing is, we all were those children. We believed we were great artists, we sang and danced when we were happy and acted out cops and robbers for hours. No one ever stopped and said, ""I'm not a very good robber. I've run out of ideas. I think I need to research my character."" We always had endless ideas. Endless positivity. Endless faith in our own talent. What happened to us?

One answer is: our education. We hope at least that your education was free because, wherever you got it, it has screwed you over and transformed you from someone who volunteered fearlessly and believed in your own creative abilities into someone who is unwilling to get up at all in case ""you make a fool of yourself,"" and who claims they ""can't"" sing, dance, draw, act, or speak in public and who has no imagination.

When you're at school, if the teacher tells the class to write an essay and everyone else is writing, and you're just sitting there all Zen and relaxed, thinking about your essay, what will happen? The teacher will shout at you. She'll say ""You! You're not even trying!."" She would know if you were trying because trying looks like something. If your shoulders are hunched and you look worried and a little ill, then the teacher will probably come and do it for you. We learn to look anxious before we do things--like we're not up to it.

We also tend to punish ourselves after we do things. Two adults will volunteer for something, and after they finish they'll make a physical gesture of apology which says to the room: ""No need to mention it--we know it wasn't very good."" Maybe this is because we teach our children to punish themselves if they suspect they've failed. When you're a kid, if you're washing dishes and you break a plate and you say, ""Well, never mind, everyone drops things from time to time,"" and you clean it up in a relaxed and happy fashion, your mother will shout at you. That in our society is a ""bad attitude."" A ""good attitude"" is to cry and feel worthless. Then your mother will say, ""Never mind, darling, it was only an accident,"" and clean it up for you. Therefore, as adults, we anticipate this; we've learned to. We look anxious before and after everything we do to avoid punishment from others.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_qjni0,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/qjni0/anxiety_is_taught_to_us/,

I was always a relatively shy dude, and did not really make a move ever, exept 3 years ago on my now Ex GF, which i knew for a few weeks at that point.

I think that I am confident enough to start out conversations with girls that I dont know, but I always think to long about it and in the end, I don't talk to them at all except if I happen get eye contact and and she seems a bit interested.
Im not seeking ONS, I basically just want to improve on my shyness with girls. If something develops out of these flirts, I wouldn't say no obviously, but that hasn't happened yet ;)

My most used argument is, that they are probably there with their BF, since you rarely see groups of only girls.   
As soon as they seem know some guys and talk with them, I immediately give up because I am afraid I would try to hit on them in front of their BF.. ^^

The other one is obviously that I dont want to come across as awkward in front of her friends (weirdly also in front of my buddys, now writing about it, I guess its not as good as i thought with my self esteem )

From the time we were born, most of us were sheltered from reality by our parents. Most issues/conflicts that affect us either directly or indirectly were kept from us, so as to protect our childlike innocence.

However, a prolonged and sustained use of this ""shelter"" may have cost our perception of reality.

As we got older, our minds were conditioned in such a way that issues/conflict and/or pain is not a familiar emotion for us. We want this 'balance' back. Therefore, escapism arrives in the form of addiction/retreat/denile. 

I for one have had enough. My addiction takes so much out of me. My mind does not settle in any reality setting. It keeps wandering and drifting off to my addictions. I have had enough of ""The perfect world"". I'm through tricking myself with fake worlds/fake maps/fake people (NPCs) and a fake life.

I want reality. Its not fair that My friends have better real lives. It just isn't. My anxiety has fucked up a lot of things. But I want to control it. I want to live with it without losing my shit and getting stomach cramps in social settings. The answer cannot be the internet. It cannot be RPGs. It is more exposure. 

I had an experience of getting rejected a few years ago. It was the most painful thing I have experienced (not counting anxiety migraines). It got me depressed for 6 months. I felt like a useless person. I won't go into details of all the self-doubt and insecurity. But towards the end, I felt different. I felt closer to reality. I accepted the fact I had too many flaws. I accepted that these flaws were weaknesses. I accepted the fact that it was time to tighten those loose bolts. It was time to get polished up and get my ass of the ground. 

You know what I did? I grew. I identified my serious flaws. Started working on them. Though my addiction never really recovered, I looked better, spoke better, thought more about myself, and i learned self-maintenance. Because the more we upgrade, the more maintenance we need.

I got rid of That fucking shelter. I threw it away. I let my instinct take over. I adapted to social settings, made the effort to go out. To listen to people's opinions.

 Now, I'm back at home, stuck to my screen, fucking it all up. Feeling like $2. Fuck. I need the feeling of rejection.

My day started at 10am doing homework I should have done on Sunday night but didn't because of the Super Bowl. I was in the Business School building when I noticed a guy on the same bench as me to my right had the same book that I used in a class my freshman year. I tried to say something to him about it but he either ignored me or didn't hear me so I blow it off; I didn't care. Then I tried about 10 minutes later and same thing happened.

But then I looked to my left and there was this girl and I said to her, ""I don't know why he didn't say anything!"" She responded, ""Yeah I know. I'm in the same class as that guy."" And so we started talking. Her name was A. and she was a senior psych major and sociology minor. That conversation lasted 15 minutes but they were good 15 minutes. I was feeling pretty good.

The second conversation I had was with the same girl from my last update, the one I asked out but she turned me down. We have a class together and it is one if the dullest classes I've had in college. Regardless, we sit next to each other because we know each other. We talk about the Super Bowl and our favorite commercials and how we have been since we last talked. It was a pretty good conversation, but the main takeaway that I got from it was that I can get along with someone who turned me down, which is something I didn't know before because I had never asked anyone else out in college.

The third conversation was with a British girl in my Political Science class. I don't know her name, so we'll just call her British girl for now. She originally asked to see my book, but then we got to talking about my favorite subject, music. I have a strange love affair with local British rock so we get to talking about that and she has been to all these festivals and it makes me want to go to festivals too. Maybe when I have money. Anyway, it was a nice conversation and I got to know England from an English person's perspective and I got to know a classmate better.

1) **Take a chill pill**          

No matter how ok you think you are, no matter how cool everything is(just a broken blinker and some scrapes on the plastic, because my Jeep is a TANK, bitch!), the best course of action at this point is to cancel everything that can be cancelled, go home and watch Robocop 3, now available on Netflix. Now this is a very specific scenario, added for comedic purposes, but the point is this: whenever you're overwhelmed with Stuff, first thing to do is to take a step back, relax and take it in. This applies to anything: loosing your job, break up, 49ers loosing the Superbowl, anything that is capital ""S"" Stressful. If you can't control that new stress, then you need to reduce the stress in areas you do have control over. **Temporarily** cut out working out, practice, going out, etc. Temporarily means for no longer than a week, after that it becomes a bad habit.           

1.5) **Bonus sub-step: Drink lots of tea with honey and relax**      

I read somewhere that your blood sugar levels directly affect your will power. Since then tea with honey have been my evening drink of choice(Yogi Tea Kombucha, if you must know).             
Now let's say that the car accident is just a cherry on top of your bullshit sundae. Let's say that you also have to deal with oh, I don't know...Your ex, lawyers, bureaucratic red tape on two continents pertaining to your job, bureaucratic red tape on two continents pertaining to your personal matters, your little side business unexpectedly kicking you in the balls, Klingons(don't ask), and filing taxes. What do you do then? This is where you do the second step, while taking a chill pill and drinking your delicious sweet tea. You:          

2 **Make a plan of attack**         

A good plan starts out with you writing everything down using the same tools as the ones used by George Washington during his plan to birth America: pen and paper(or parchment and quill, your choice, really). Write everything down in list format, then think back to your 5th grade math. Try to ignore the fond memories of that first time you noticed boobs on Mrs. Austin, who, let's face it, had a pretty nice rack despite the fact that she was 53. Instead think about the lesson about finding the smallest common denominator, and breaking things down to the simplest numbers. Do the same for your problems. Break up Big Problems into smaller ones and pair those small problems with simple solutions. Make a nice, organized ""problem-solution"" list starting with the simplest solutions at the top. One thing you might notice is that nowadays many problems can be solved with ""make a phone call"". That's your task list, or your ""Quest objectives"", for the nerdy ones.                

3) **Get a ""clicky"" pen**         

4) **Use the ""clicky"" pen to scratch off tasks as you complete them**           

Important note: use the ""clicky"" pen exclusively for starching off tasks and before you know it, [it'll be your victory music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YCN-a0NsNk). 
As you complete the simplest tasks something magical will happen, with every task completed, no matter how small, you'll feel better, more in control, and more motivated to complete harder, more time consuming tasks. When you have a giant heap to work through, and things seemingly pile on no matter what you do, well, we tend to feel powerless, and therefore unmotivated. Making a dummy-proof plan(by the way, you might have to adjust it several times depending on how things work out), and following through one simple step at a time give you a sense of control over your life and pushes you to keep going. Also, having a plan and following through gives you ability to see the future, you know what you will do and what will be the result of it. It's an awesome state of mind to be in and it'll help you with the final step:              

5) **Adjust your plan on the fly and never give up**         

Not everything you do will work on the first try. If you fail once, then that means that you're working on a solution by method of elimination, try something else. Don't give up. Remember that you put this problem on your list and started solving it because it was causing you stress and you didn't want it in your life any more, if you stop, then it'll just sit there, growing mold and stinking up your life. The difference between adults and children is that adults realize there is no good or bad, there are just actions and consequences. Children hope that something will break that chain, that there can be actions without consequences, or that there can be outcomes without actions. It's called ""wishing"". Every time you go ""I wish..."" and don't do anything about it, you're being childish. ""I wish I was famous!"" Great! Welcome to YouTube! ""I wish I was rich!"" Awesome! You can be a millionaire! Read bunch of great books on the subject. [Start with Dave Ramsey](http://www.daveramsey.com/home/). ""I wish my life didn't suck so much, I wish I didn't have all these problems..."" Guess what? You're the only one who can change that. *But guess what?* You totally have the power to! It's like you're your own magic Genie that can grant any wish, except you have to pay an equal price for your wish first. Kind of like equivalent exchange in the Fullmetal Alchemist. If you know what you want and how to get there, you will be able to do anything and put up with any shit, simply because you know that every shitty step you take is a step towards your goal, maybe even your dream.

My comment about social anxiety that shakedown submitted to bestof made the front page of reddit, wtf?! If you sent me a message or email and haven't heard back, you're not alone. School started this week and I haven't had time to do much with the blog/responding to people at all. I'll try to do more this weekend. 

Anyway, I just wanted to write a reminder that today is technically the last day to send me a message about the online improvement group. I'm going to extend that until Sunday evening since I likely won't be able to do anything for the group until then anyway. I've had a few responses, but the geographic locations of those interested might make it hard to run a weekly group because of the time differences. I'll definitely do 1-on-1 chats with interested participants at this point, and if it works out that we can all come together online as a group, even a few times, then great. If not, I'm happy to link people together who are in the same time zones and maybe we can have mini-groups.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, here is a repost from the AMA: 

I like this forum quite a bit because I find that most of the people who post here are generally not whiners who blame everyone else for their problems. They genuinely want to make positive changes in their lives, but often don't know how. Not knowing ""how"" is okay - there are many things one can do in order to learn. It's the attitude that is important to start off with.

My favorite types of people to work with when I do therapy and mentoring are the people who have self-awareness. They understand the impact of their own decisions, often recognize why these decisions are not positively influencing their lives, but don't know how to enact change. Make sense? I can help you if you want to help yourself.

The types of people I don't enjoy working with are the people who complain a lot about their lives, have excuses for everything, and don't recognize or take any responsibility for their own actions.
I've been thinking in the last few days how else I can try to support the people who read this forum. I read in another post that some people are interested in doing a men's group. I have an idea that may or may not work, but if people are interested, I'd be willing to explore it. I'd like to find 4-5 guys on this forum who would be interested in being part of a group. I would help to lead/facilitate this group to begin with (running groups is something I do at work, so I do have some experience with it). 

It would involve weekly group meetings, at a set time and day, in an online chat. I would also have one-on-one online chats with each of the members to help them identify their problems and help them set goals. After that, I can act as a ""personal trainer"" of sorts - someone who will check in and see how the goals are going, push them when they're feeling poorly about meeting goals, offer encouragement, etc.
In order for this to work, the members really need to be the self-aware, non-complainer types I mention above. I would be tailoring exercises for each person, and checking in to see if they are doing these exercises. E.g. For someone who has social anxiety and really doesn't like to leave the house, I might tell them to walk around the block once as a starting goal. Then we would check in about that, see how they felt, and set bigger goals for them to accomplish if that worked out. That's just an example, and it will be different for each person in the group. Once a week, you will all come together online, talk about what's been happening, and support each other.

If anyone is interested in this, send me a message on reddit or email me at datingwtf@gmail.com by Friday, Jan 25th with a paragraph describing yourself with the subject line ""Improvement Group"". I am interested in 3 things: 1) A brief history of issues you have, 2) Why you would benefit from being in this group, and 3) Anything you feel like telling me about your age, occupation, level of education, interests like favorite movies, music, etc. If you have an OKCupid profile, you could link me to that if you'd prefer. The purpose of 3) is to help match people. A group is not going to work out well if you have nothing in common. Most importantly, in your message, be honest and open. I will be able to tell if you're just telling me things you think I want to hear. [Edit: It is actually pretty important for me to know your age and location, so please do include that.]

If people are interested, and we form a group, I'd check in with the group members to see if they'd be willing to share their progress on this forum with everyone else.

I have had this idea floating around in my head for a while. When I first stumbled upon this subreddit earlier this year, I saw the Shakedown Method and then read No More Mr. Nice Guy.

In the book it said to try to find and join or make a men's group. Well men's groups are surprisingly hard to find and I don't really have that big of a social circle so I thought I was SOL. But then it hit me, ""I do have a social circle full of guys who are trying to better themselves, r/faimprovement!""

So here's my idea and it's so crazy it might just work. Basically have a men's group made up of members of this subreddit. We could choose a time and day of the week to meet on and then use Oovoo or Google Hangouts to have the meetings. I just need to get an idea about how many guys would be interested in doing this.

If you are interested, please reply to this thread or send me a PM. This is to gauge interest in the subreddit and without input from the subreddit, this won't happen.

I've found that in one-on-one conversations I do ok (but not great), but my biggest problem is interacting in a group. I can really relate to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1ag2dh/one_on_one_conversations/c8x6r35) on not being able to get a word in.

It always seems like when I am trying to interact in a group I am always just a little too slow (or at least slower than the others) in giving responses. As a result, I end up just standing there in silence. Yesterday someone commented that I hadn't said anything yet and explicitly asked for my opinion. At that point though, I had nothing to say and it just got awkward.

A side problem is, that the longer I am left out of the conversation, the less they talk in my direction. This can sometimes makes it difficult to hear what they are saying (in noisy environments) and results in even fewer responses from me.

I don't really know how to handle this. Any advice for me on how to interact with groups of people?

The year has been ok with me. Few ups and downs. Got Fired, Got into school, still lonely. These days there's a lack of self-care (don't take showers as often and I eat lot of junk food because I smoke so much weed).  

Well I'm turning 26 soon and there needs to be some sort of urgency of ending this problem I have. Though the more I think about it, the more i spiral into sadness and loneliness. 

I've had a ton of life experiences (both really bad and good),done quite a bit, I have many wide varied interests, and I'm well read. I know a lot about a lot of other stuff. So I can have a conversation with anyone. 

Thing I have problems making bonds with people. I may have a great conversation or two with anyone, but that's it usually. And when I perceive that they reject me on some level, I retreat back into my shell and think about all the bad things that have been done to me. 

I try and let go of my anger at people and what's been done to me, but all i'm left with loneliness and sadness. 

Especially with girls I have trouble continuing conversations and building a rapport.

I'm 31, and at this point in my life, pretty much everybody who meets me probably just assumes that I've had sex at some point. Yeah, sure, I'm not perfect, but there's nothing about me that would give someone the sense that ""yeah, he's probably a virgin in his 30s"". The thing is, it has become a pretty dark secret, and I'm really squeamish about talking about it with anyone or sharing it with anyone.

So I am in a place in my life where I've been meeting people, including some women, and including some women I'm attracted to. The problem is, I just think about how awkward it would be to tell her that I'm a virgin, and it shuts me down. I want her to think I'm confident and have it together. Yeah, eventually if she becomes my girlfriend, I might be willing to share deep, dark secrets with her, but that seems a long way off. 

I *know* that many women say they'd be nice about it and wouldn't care, and a lot of them probably genuinely wouldn't. For me, though, I just imagine getting more and more anxious as I'm doing things like kissing and cuddling for the first time and pretending I know what I'm doing, and I worry even more about telling her that I've never had sex before (honestly, there's no way I'm just going to try and fake that). 

I just meet a woman who seems nice and maybe even seems to like me, and I just think ""yeah, but I couldn't tell her *that*. She just wouldn't understand.""

I tend to roleplay hopeless romantic scenes with my head. This is before I try to make myself fall asleep (every night at bed) I don't have insomnia but I do it because I feel comfortable thinking up these scenes. 

Maybe because it's the lack of attention I get outside or maybe because I want to be noticed. I'm aware of the need of a social life but, I don't think it's necessary for me right now because I have other important issues I have to tend with, like job hunts and a foundation (how can I even start a life with literally nothing above my head?) It's just not practical and I think I have to choose between discipline and having no life (at the meantime) or throwing myself out there and just getting upset because I still have unresolved issues.   

I play hopeless romantic scenes with my head every time I try to sleep, because I think it's comfortable to me that feeling sad, hopeless and then pretending to have that perfect opposite gender; fall ""in love"" at me, because I have incredible talent and that I am superman (in these pretends). I should just write a book! But I notice that thinking up such scenes requires emotional play and too much creativity that it leaves me not sleeping it all, I sleep faster if I think about construction; for example. And I don't have a good, strong social network, it's basically nothing, the only people I talk to are my clients.

I think it's about discipline. I always wonder about this habit of mine, it's nothing but the bending of emotions, artificial emotions, it's not productive. Anyone else do this?

So how do I get to a point where I can flip the on switch to this mental state? Even better, how can I flip that switch on and break it so it stays on?

[Dating for 'Nice Guys' - Part 1](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/blackballon/journal/592876856208122552/Thoughts-about-dating-for-quot;nice-guys-quot;)

Apr 12

**""Safe"" guys vs. ""Unsafe"" guys.**

Please, if you're the type of guy who's like, ""All girls just want to date assholes. Nice guys always finish last. Girls are bitches,"" then don't read this. It's not going to help. It might be helpful if you're actually a nice guy and don't just think you are one. Because actual nice guys don't think like that.

""Be confident. Women are attracted to guys who have confidence.""

What does that actually mean? I keep hearing this and it's not very specific or informative. Confidence. There are so many ways this can be interpreted. You could be an amazing guitar player, excellent at killing zombies online, have a PhD and numerous publications, or be the best damn cook you know. In these cases, you're probably very confident at what you do. But these skills do not necessarily equate to being able to attract girls. Confidence in dating is something different, and there are certain traits that convey this confidence. I'll try to explain...

I believe there are two types of guys, ""safe"" guys and ""unsafe"" guys. When I say ""unsafe,"" I don't mean guys who are violent, psychopathic, or have unprotected sex. It's a type of personality. I can usually tell within a few hours of meeting a guy, any random guy, if he's ""safe"" or ""unsafe"". Characteristics of ""safe"" - predictable, caring, very nice guys who you know will drop everything to be with you, eager to please, very sweet. The type of guy you'd want to have a family with - good father, dependable, doesn't cheat, etc. The type of guy who often ends up in the friend zone. Don't fret if you are one of these guys. In fact, I hope you ARE one of these guys. You'll make a girl very happy one day. But how to find this girl? How do you get to the stage where a girl you're interested in becomes interested in you? This is stage 1 of the relationship. You're not going to be able to show the girl how awesome you are if she doesn't give you a chance. I'll talk more about this later.

Let's move on to characteristics of ""unsafe"". I'm going to summarize it as an ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude. It's about being your own person. Not being needy, being independent, being self-assured, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you. Someone who doesn't need a lot of validation from others. All that is what I think ""confidence"" really means. Are you the type of person who tells a joke, then looks around to see if anyone laughs? That's needing validation. Not giving a fuck is telling a joke and being chill about it if no one laughs.

A lot of guys who fall into the ""unsafe"" category are emotionally unavailable. They can be selfish, don't want to give as much as they take, and may treat girls poorly. Yet they seem to have an easier time attracting them. I think what many girls really want is both. They want a combination of safe and unsafe. They WANT to be attracted to these nice guys who they know will treat them like a queen, but they just aren't. Attraction can't be forced, and I'm not talking about how you look. It's that confidence/unsafe shit. If they don't feel it, they don't feel it. So maybe having ""unsafe"" characteristics will get the attraction started, and having ""safe"" characteristics will keep the relationship going. Guys, don't be a dick. I'm pretty sure I'm not conveying this very well right now, but do not treat women poorly. Borrowing/displaying ""unsafe"" characteristics (being your own person, not being needy, being independent, being self-assured, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you) without being a true asshole is what will get you the girl.

Here's an example of what I'm trying to say. Sometimes a guy doesn't even need to talk to convey whether they are ""safe"" or ""unsafe"". A few years ago, I was at this concert. The band was kind of famous in the 90s with the college crowd. While the lead singer was jumping around, engaging with the audience, I could not take my eyes off the lead guitarist the entire time. He's totally not my type at all, but he really had the ""I don't give a fuck"" thing going on. While the lead singer was bouncing around, this guy was just mellowing out, playing his guitar like there was no one else there watching. Very understated and nonchalant. Didn't need validation. At the end of the day, the better looking lead singer with all the charm and charisma probably has a higher probability of having sex with the groupies (if he's into that). But the understated guy is probably getting laid too, without doing much at all. I don't know how easy it is to be charming and funny like the hot lead singer, but being like the understated guitarist is very doable and can be ""learned"".

I don't have time to write much more now, and give specific examples, but I wanted to add this. There's this erotic fiction book I'm reading right now, called ""50 Shades of Grey"", and it's been dubbed ""mommy porn"" by the media. It's selling really well, especially for a dirty novel. I read a lot of reviews about this book and thought I wouldn't like it much, but decided to read the first few chapters free on Amazon, got sucked in, then bought it. It's better than I thought, and I can totally see why women are eating it up. The main male character is a good example of ""safe"" and ""unsafe"". He's a controlling asshole a lot of the time, but he really cares about the girl and he's not scared to show it. There are a lot of other characters in the book who have an interest in the main female character too, but they are too ""safe"" and she is not reciprocating the interest. If you want some examples of ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" read some of the book.

I'll do a part 2 on this topic at some point in time with more examples and specifics.

This is no good because how the hell can I actually know? Admit it though, every one of you does this.

&gt; That girl is attractive, but she's drinking with that guy, so they must be going out together.

&gt; ---

&gt; Hmm, she's cute, but she's hanging with a group of people and isn't interested in meeting anybody new.

&gt; ---

&gt; She is pretty, and sitting alone with welcoming body language. I think she might be looking to meet someone.

You may be right, but you may not be. So this last week I've been putting my assumptions to the test.

I was sitting in a tea cafe and there was a very attractive girl sitting alone reading some note cards. I sat at the table next to hers and opened with, ""Hi, are you a teacher grading some papers?"" I knew she wasn't, but that didn't matter. A conversation started and it was really interesting. I learned a lot about her and she was really cool. She was also married.

Three nights ago I was at a bar and saw this one girl who was hanging out with 4 guys. I went up to her and made a comment about her Chinese food that she just walked in with and started eating at the bar like it was completely normal to do. She was single, and just visiting these guy friends in town that she knew from college. She works in IT and is from New York.


Two nights ago I saw this girl sitting at a bar by herself with body language completely closed off. I said to myself, this girl definitely doesn't want to talk to *anyone*. So I'm going to try and start a conversation and see if I'm right. I saw a NASCAR commercial and told her that I would probably be the only guy she met in DC who is into NASCAR. She laughed and agreed and told me she went to college in Daytona, FL. We spoke a bit and I made a comment about how she seems agitated or angry about something. I was right about that -- her friend texted her just then saying she wasn't going to make it and plans fell through. She just wanted to drink her beer and go home. Fair enough.

So there you go. You may be surprised. Just go up and say something, anything. You can learn a little bit about someone and what they're like. But the only way that can happen is if you talk to her.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_r51oo,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/r51oo/you_wont_know_anything_about_her_unless_you_talk/,

As promised, I would like to describe my experience of getting blown out. It is important to note that I went in to each approach wanting and knowing that I would get rejected. It is what I expected would happen. I needed to fight my approach anxiety and learn how to take rejection.

Two of my socially awkward friends came with me to witness the event. 

The first few girls I approached, I said, ""Hi, my name's Zack. I just had to meet you"". These girls were sitting at the bar and I approached them from behind. Two girls said, ""Sorry, not interested."" Two others didn't even acknowledge me. They just continued looking at their phones.

I approached another girl from the back who was dancing with a friend. Again, I tried, ""Hi, I'm Zack. I just had to meet you"" ...She turned around and literally jumped in fright. I scared her half to death.

I quickly learned that approaching girls from the back was a poor idea. They need to see you coming towards them.

I started approaching girls from the front. The C Lo Green song ""Fuck you"" came on and I'm a decent dancer so I walked over to these three girls dancing. This time I said nothing, just made eye contact and danced with the three of them. I had my arms wrapped around two of the shoulders of two of the girls and felt I was having moderate success. Then I would dance with each one individually and go back and forth between them all. The song ends, and my socially awkward friend walks over to the girl I was dancing with and told her I had STDs which is not true at all. WTF? She walked away.

The rest of the night was really just me approaching saying a variety of things, ""That dress really makes you stand out..."" or whatever other lines I could come up with. I have found that many girls just do not acknowledge you. Straight up ignore, which I found fascinating. If I started to wuss out, my friends would encourage me on and not let anyone get away.

I went home with a rather interesting perspective of rejection. It sucked, but in the end, it really didn't matter. These girls rejected me, so what? I'll never see them again so who gives a fuck?

I need to talk about this to you all because it's relevant. I did a search on dancing in this group and I didn't see much on it.    

My major issue with escalating with women, and in conversation in general, is touching people to help create connection. I want to really get this down. Also, escalation with women in general is difficult for me.    

Dancing is starting to really pull this problem away from me. I am still anxious in general, but when I dance it is really knocking all my anxiety out of the way.    

I decided to go social dancing a couple of days ago. I went to a swing club and just started asking women to dance, and I was asked to dance quite often as well. What I found out quickly was I had NO problem going up to any hot girl and asking. I had no problem taking them out to the dance floor by the hand and becoming a casanova.     

In particular there was this one time where I asked this girl to dance and we did, but it was too fast for her. So she sat back down and I said ""hey, what if I teach you a slower dance?"" and without even thinking this was any sort of problem, I took her hand and smiled and led her out and just started teaching her, and laughing and twirling and everything. I mean... what? Me? The anxious, scared guy? Just being as natural as a fish in water being this charming man, a real man, an alpha male, with this beautiful woman. What the heck? But I did it. Seriously, it was like a tv show or movie.    

The amazing thing about this kind of environment is that there's no awkwardness (aside from you messing up when you dance, which is understandable because everyone knows everyone else is trying their hardest). Easily, if you want, you finish the dance and say ""thanks!"" and walk away like it was nothing and feel no anxiety. If you want you could continue talking to people, which I did do sometimes, and people always love to talk.    

I noticed several things. Women would smile and swoon and get really excited and talk to me. I noticed lots of women really just want to look into your eyes and be seduced. I noticed lots of women want to flirt with you. I'd be so excited about dancing that I had no problems talking and dancing with anyone. I was completely and utterly out of my head and in my body and my feelings and the present moment. I was being present with the women as well. It is everything I have learned that I should do but can't do. But when I'm in this environment I can do it easily. I noticed women were looking at me across the room after I dance with them, like they really liked me or wanted me to come back. Remember I am a beginner, so my dancing is awkward and noobish.  Thing is, I don't really care. We're just out dancing and trying.

When I went out in real life the next day, I felt this rush of confidence. I feel like I can more easily talk to anyone. And although I haven't done it yet (since I'm just starting this whole experiment), I really feel like touching women or men in a friendly way isn't as much of a hurdle to me as it was before. I really feel like I can just do it, because I know how to touch a woman on the dance floor without being creepy and being confident.    

I recommend taking some classes and going out to dance socially as well. I am going again next week.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_1bah1u,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1bah1u/try_dancing/,

&gt; Most people here have a pretty lofty definition in mind when I say the word evangelism. However, a professor of mine once gave me a very simple definition that really reflects the core idea; ""Evangelism is one beggar telling another beggar where to get food.""

Now, whatever philosophical or religious inclination you may or may not have, the statement is an interesting one, based on the idea of deconstructing something that people seem to think is very complicated into something very simple. That got me to thinking about how people of our situation (on the road to self improvement) can often see the massive complexities in any given situation, and fail to realize that sometimes things are incredibly simple. 

With that, let me offer a statement of my own;

&gt; A lot of people here seem to feel that dating can be a complex, near impossible to understand ritual. I posit that dating is simply two people talking to each other.

An oversimplification? Perhaps. I think, however, there's an advantage to thinking about something much more simply. I talk to people every day. Why can't I talk to someone over coffee, lunch, or dinner? Should it be any different talking to this one person that it is when I talk to my co-workers, my family, or someone at the store?

Nine days ago I embarked on a journey of relentless self-improvement, sparked by one of the more popular posts I saw on this subreddit. I vowed to myself to spend one whole year making myself more sexually viable - learning to be funnier and a better conversationalist instead of my usual sperglord self, getting swole, broadening my range of interests, etc.

Things were going extremely well until today morning. Until today, I had no problem being 100% focused on my quest, even when in the presence of beautiful women. I'm not sure what gave way in my subconscious, but seeing all the attractive women at my workplace brought some very dark thoughts to the forefront of my mind. I suddenly had an intense desire for a girlfriend. I couldn't get this thought out of my head for the rest of the day, no matter how hard I tried. I couldn't stop thinking about how I've pissed away the last 17 years of my life while everyone around me - men and women - have made great strides in both their personal and professional lives. They've experienced far better things than I have. 22 year olds have seen much more of the world than I have at 28. I haven't had the sexual experiences they've had. I haven't known women all across the spectrum of human personality unlike the fortunate many.

I realize that these thoughts serve no purpose besides undermining my state of mind. I know that my past can't be changed and it's futile to dwell on it. I know that I should be looking forward. But while I understand this intellectually, the longing still pushes every other thought out of my mind. I'm so desperate that I can't focus on my work. It didn't do me any good to tell myself, ""LaceChokerNecklace, they're nothing more than a distraction. Self-improvement matters much more than companionship. Focus on what matters.""

I'm not sure where to start, so apologies if this isn't the most linear post. I have platonic female friends that I get along well with and that I'm funny and confident around, but as soon as I become interested in a woman, I become this needy monster.

For instance, the other day I was with a group of friends. The girl I have a crush on was there. We were talking about the kinds of music we liked. I like rock/metal music and she likes electronic music. This music conversation continued on Facebook. I sent her a link to a Youtube video of a band I like. I kept asking her why she didn't like it until she eventually told me that not everybody is going to like the things I like and she doesn't expect people to like the things she likes. I had an ""Oh God, what the fuck"" moment. I normally say that to others, but here I was hearing it from someone else. 

It hit me like a ton of bricks. I was seeking her approval on the things I liked. And when she didn't like it, I was begging her to like it because it was a form of validation. If she likes the things that I like, then I might be good enough for her. With my platonic female friends, I couldn't care less if they like the things I like and vice versa.

I've never had much romantic interest from women. And this seems to feed off of itself where lack of romantic interest &gt; neediness &gt; lack of romantic interest and so on and so forth.

How can I get past this neediness and start to treat women I'm interested in more like my platonic friends where I'm confident and funny around instead of needy?

Now, what the hell is the signal to approach? Just her looking in my eyes the same moment I do? I would say that just happens occasionally, doesn't it? Do I have to look in her eyes a bit longer and see if she looks away or continues to look in my eyes?

To me eye contact is some of the worst stuff happening, I look around, maybe looking at a girl she looks around and sees me and -bang- eye contact! And I just get shocked and look away immediately. :/

**edit:** seems like no one knows what the signal is, that shakedownlab talks about. :( Most of you just write one should just approach, but then the often asked, never answered question comes up ""what should I say?""

For this reason I'm convinced no one wants to speak to me and the very sound of my voice shuts down the conversation.  I think this is a key source of my lack of confidence as taking lessons in kickboxing, grappling, wrestling and mma to the point where I can match some of the fighters at my gym hasn't helped one bit.

Now, I did take an acting class once where I learned about how to project my voice by speaking from the diaphragm and wasn't really taught anything about inflection.  The problem is that it doesn't really help with normal conversation where I don't have lines memorized and have to think of things to say and don't want my voice to be so loud that people several rooms over can hear me.

How can I improve my voice for everyday use so that it sounds good in regular conversations and I can speak to people?  I don't like sitting at my computer on reddit on a friday night when I know there are so many people having a good time that I'm not.

Socializing that goes well would be associated with a very dramatic positive shift in my mood and overall state. This would happen even if I wasn't craving socializing beforehand or expecting such an effect.

Not socializing would basically lead to withdrawals which have negative effects on my overall state. Over time, the craving for socializing might decrease or go away. Unfortunately, socializing seems to be an addiction that can never end. Decrease in craving just meant that I was burying parts of myself, and getting more mentally messed up as a result.

Yesterday I had three fairly long conversations with strangers. This was surprising. I'm surprised it happened because I wasn't really practising any attempts at being more social. I was also surprised because it didn't cause such a dramatic positive mental state shift. I guess both were because I was in a good state to begin with. Being in a good state makes socializing much easier, both in terms of my own capabilities and how others react. The good state was about as good as the good state that was triggered by socializing before. I guess such socializing tends to bring me to that better state rather than making me feel that much better in general, and I was already there.

My attitude in retrospect is also surprising. Those were good parts of my day, but they don't feel too exceptional. The lack of it can seem like a huge problem, but this just seems normal.

In the past, I imagined socializing with strangers would involve a horrible feeling of emptiness which makes it pointless or worse. The only thing I wanted was socializing with close friends. (Unfortunately, socializing with strangers is needed for making friends.)

These experiences didn't have that effect. Sure, they didn't involve deep personal information, but the overall emotional dynamic wasn't empty and pointless.

I'm becoming more optimistic, thinking that there is a chance for me and everyone who has felt like me to get better. 

As a result, I've expressed a lot of this to my friends. One likes to spend a lot of time online in communities where the overall mood is negative. People there talk about how lonely they are or posts depressing stories about their lives. I understand that he is just trying to find people he can relate to but I believe that it does more harm than good. It causes him to justify his negative outlook on life by reading stories of people going through much rougher situations than he is and only strengthens him in his ways.

So, I expressed my displeasure as usual when he sends me another story. This gets him on a huge victim puke saying that I look down upon these people and that life isn't as simple that working to improve yourself can improve it and that no one in their right mind would seek professional help because it's too pride damaging. I try to argue back but I started to realize we just see things differently now.

I may be an asshole. I was probably too overbearing. I was probably too cold. I was probably pushing him too hard. But it's not that I don't understand. I've almost killed myself multiple times and even started self-mutilation until I forced myself to stop. Because I was too scared to talk to my parents, I did turn to the internet and complained which only made me more withdrawn. That's why I get so frustrated with him. He's making the same mistakes. He's victimizing himself, he's wallowing around feeling sorry for himself, he complains about his lack of a romantic interest in his life constantly. 

I suppose that's why I was his friend in the first place. I related to him. But I don't want to be a pessimist like I always was. I want to always see what good I already have instead of what bad things are keeping me from what I want. 

So, I don't know what to do. I care about him a lot. And I want him to be happy. But I don't think I can help him when I'm trying to help myself. I want to be an optimist but he just seems like the opposite of one. I can't hate him for that, but I don't think it's healthy for me.

I am a 25 year old female. I have always been awkward socially, I have a very hard time making friends especially with girls my age . However I have always, chronically you may argue- had a boyfriend ( yeah  maybe I'm afraid of being alone). I have had some really bad relationships and wonderful ones as well. When I am single however, I do not give out my number/answer your texts/calls unless I know you.

 It is not that I don't like your appearance, your manners, your confidence level , your joke, it is because of me. My personal lack of confidence and insecurity with myself and my worth. If an attractive or funny man asked for my number at a yoga studio, restaurant bar or Christmas party I would say no. If we became friends or good acquaintances of course I would give him a chance.

I suppose it is that many of us silly females just need repeat encounters of the non-creepy kind. Treat us like dudes. Chemistry is very dependent on situation.

I read too much Faulkners gloominess - hence the introspectiveness. Please bear with me.

I spent my childhood in the anus of Eastern Europe, where neo-nazi parades, drinking beer on the street and theft are a regular and accepted part of life. A strange and bookish child, bullying was a regular occurence for me. There were beatdowns from bigger kids but also venomous putdowns from girls. I could go into lengths as to why it happened and how miserable it made me feel, but it's in the past now. Suffice to say that being around peers was hell and I longed to be in an environment where I was some unnoticeable hermit crab.

After 6 years of tests, interviews and painful waiting, my family got an opportunity to move to Canada. Although we made it, the awkwardness of adolescence was amplified by the being some strange kid who has never seen shiny cars, or planes, or affluent communities. But to be frank, it was mostly me being a strange and misanthropic weirdo with the fashion sense of a scarecrow.

Since then I have been through the army, saved a sizable amount of money and am currently learning machining. Things that most people find difficult such as exercise or frugality, or overcoming some sort of hardship are now almost second nature at this point. The material and emotional privation of my early years makes it easy to separate wants from needs. Yet when it comes to socializing or simply opening up to people I am  at the level of a  bumbling preteen. I have become quite experienced at hiding this fact and am unable to relate to my peers in any way.

All these things I freely admit to myself and have no pretenses of being some poor, tortured soul that deserve a shower of love, affection, and sex. I've had plenty of time to fix the aforementioned problems and at this stage my inaction and cowardice is just as responsible as the bullying 12 years ago.  To be fair, however, I try to maintain a positive outlook at least for the sake of day-to-day utility - regular exercise got me a killer body and I can interact freely with people as I go about my day.

In the last year, my physique and the way I carry myself have been improving tremendously, until I found out that apparently I have had hepatitis C my entire life. Now I am faced with a year-long treatment akin to chemo and odd hours for my apprenticeship. My only friend is moving away soon and despite the relatively positive outlook I've had so far, it honestly feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I  do not remember the last time I interacted with a woman.  I have no social circle and no social experiences to draw from. I am an infantile hermit with the body of a male underwear model.

I am a complete loser, yet strangely there is no real despair. There are things to be learned, books to be read and workouts to be done. Hell, bacon still exists and that's as good of a reason not to quit as any.

If you've been reading my stories up til now, you'll know I've kissed a few girls, but each of those times, it was really all 'circumstantial' ...like we kissed because it felt right at the time -- not necessarily because there was raw attraction. 

Tonight was different.

I went out alone to a the local college bar in a blazer, slim tie, nice black jeans, and my best button down. I felt great. The night before I went out with my bosses for happy hour and they're learning all this stuff too so we were helping each other out. That was a fun night as well so I was still feeling confident and talkative. So out into the freezing cold snow I go and make my way to the bar.

I stand in the center of the bar with tons of people around me for like 30 minutes. I just stare at the sports game on the TV for what felt like forever with a Jack &amp; Coke in my hand. I started to feel like I wasn't going to be able to talk to anyone. The FA mindset started creeping in. ""No one wants to talk to me - I'm not attractive. I'm standing here alone with a drink and nothing is going to happen.""

I caught myself and stopped that line of thinking immediately and began looking for girls to approach. Grow some balls shakedown_st! Approach! Approach! Approach! Fuck, okay, I will! Shut up, brain!

I see two girls, one of them cute and I'm attracted to, at the bar waiting to order drinks. I turn to them and run the standard female opinion opener that is so famous in The Game (step 4). ""Hey guys, can I get a female opinion on something?"" They say okay. ""Okay, well real quick, because I have to get back to my friends (lol what friends?)..."" Anyway, you know the opener... After we discuss it, I say, ""How do you two know each other?"" and the conversation is under way.

I must say, I was in the zone. I was in a great state of mind and everything was just clicking. But I knew if I had any chance, I would have to get the girl I was interested in alone by herself and away from her friend. So I hang on for like 15 minutes with these two girls and finally one of their friends or some rando guy began chatting up the other girl. Bam. I pull my girl away and we can talk one on one. 

At this point it was all get-to-know-you stuff and building comfort and rapport. I told some stories and ran some of the other stuff like The Cube and she loved it. It was very accurate.

This girl is really awesome and I love her personality. We have a lot of similar interests so everything just seemed to be clicking. The whole while, from the get-go, I was escalating physical touch and contact with her so she was becoming more comfortable with me touching her. Her body language was showing all of the classic signs of attraction.

Eventually I pull her in, hips touching. This is a pattern I noticed in almost every kiss-close I get. If I get the girls hips touching my hips and we stare right into each other's eyes. The kiss is going to happen. Just go for it. So I do and it was awesome. She's a great kisser. We made out 4 times over a 90 minute period. Just me and her and talking and dancing. Funny thing -- she says rarely ever even kisses guys she just meets.

We acknowledged that we wanted to see each other again and exchanged numbers. I know say this every week lol, but maybe this time I'll get a date! It's certainly the most promising opportunity I've had so far.

One last thing. I hate being the only one posting stories from my nights. Good or bad, I'd like to see some more posts from the other subscribers to this subreddit. Obviously you don't have to, but some more participation is definitely welcomed.

**Update**: We go on the date and I'm standing outside the bar to meet her. Second I see her I knew something was wrong. Her body language was completely negative and she was extremely withdrawn from the conversation. After 20 minutes of awkwardness and me trying to get her to relax, she says, ""Hey, listen...I have to tell you something, but please don't get mad at me. I've been seeing this guy for 3 weeks and today we just decided that we're exclusive.""

Okay, a little backstory. I've been alive for sixteen years. The first eight years were pretty decent, the latter eight years were utter shit. The next eight years are coming up, with the end of high school, college and initial employment, and I want to make sure that those years are the best years of my life. 

The first eight years were decent. I had maybe three or four neighborhood friends I hung out with, and no one bothered me in elementary school.

Things started to turn to shit after fourth grade. All my neighborhood friends turned against me for my social ineptitude, nerdy interests, and unbranded clothes. In middle school I was bullied relentlessly. I had panic attacks waiting for the bus to come and was physically beaten  on multiple occasions. The defining moment of that time was the dreaded  ""trust fall"" activity. I tried to opt out at the beginning of class for fear of being dropped, but the teachers and students convinced me to give it a try... when I threw myself back, no arms were there to catch me. I was sent home with a bloody bandage on my head. The bullies were able to pass it off as an accident and were not punished. 

By high school the bullying had largely subsided, but I'd already started to believe what they had said to me. Depression settled in, my grades plummeted, and by the end of tenth grade I felt ready to kill myself.

Not anymore.

My social skills are nonexistent, but I've found career skills to be a big strength. Since starting work in the summer, I've found 3 relatively well paying jobs and have started working sixty hours a week with ~$600 dollar weekly paychecks, which has been a huge confidence booster. Driving home from work with the radio blaring was my happiest moment in about a decade.

Anyway, on the improvement part. Right now, the only people in my contacts list are my parents. Other than years of self-neglect, I have a few inherent disadvantages right off the bat:

* Shortness (5.5')

* Severe Keratosis Pillaris (red bumps on every inch of my skin)

* Autism (basically, no eye contact, no social intuition, and extreme noise sensitivity)

Stuff that can be changed, but difficult:

* Interest in software/mechanical engineering. When was the last time you met a girl into that?

* Absolutely no fashion sense/desire to spend quintiple on clothes/haircuts

*Complete inability to remember names

I want to get to meet people and build up a network of friends, but I have no idea where to start. Everyone I see seems to be texting hundreds of friends simultaneously, while the only texts I get are ads from my cell provider. What kind of events can I attend to meet new people, and once I get to know them, how do I make an offer to hang out? 

Thanks for the help. I'm sorry if this turned more into a personal vent.

My little story, I bought the book in January on recommendation from one of these communities in Reddit. I hadn't really experienced the problems outlined and was mainly researching, so I didn't end up finishing it. I'm not sure I am a 'Nice Guy', however a couple of things have happened since.

I've found myself helping out the pretty girls at university, hanging out with girls on night's out, primarily because I fancied one of them and today I've experienced a little rejection that I haven't experienced in a long time. It's fucking lame.

What happened was that I arranged to meet the girl in question, after doing a little shopping, for coffee. We ended up going for dinner with her friends. After dinner we walked past a clothes shop and they asked if I was ok going in with them. I said it was fine and I accompanied them looking for clothes.

Going back to when she and I were having coffee, she dropped in a reference to ""this guy I'm sort-of seeing"", which jarred with me a little. She was still 'single' on facebook, so I was a little confused and figured it was an ""I'm sort of dating at the moment"" thing. [edited=It now makes a lot more sense that actually nothing I did constituted us being exclusive, or dating, or in any way romantically involved. Thank's Konyfan2012.]

So during the time where I was walking through the lady's clothing sections, I had that horrible feeling; ""am I THAT guy? the sap, accompanying the girls through a clothes shop with an ulterior motive?"" or am I accompanying my next girlfriend and her mates?

We got the bus home, I hugged her goodbye and went home. An hour later her status changed to ""In a relationship"".



So of course, I've seen the evidence. I'm falling into the 'nice-guy' traits of looking for female approval at the expense of my own comfort and convenience. There were a few other instances but this was the kicker.


So, FAImprovement - I'm looking to you guys for some support. I'm considering close friends too.

I need some practical short-term goals. By that, I mean goals which are more closely linked with particular behaviours I could do, rather than eventual outcomes I might want.  Goals that can be satisfied relatively soon are especially good, because they would allow me to see some progress and success instead of failure to obtain longer-term objectives.

I'm not sure what would be good goals for me, so i would like to know more about others' short term goals. I would like responses about what are *your* short term goals and not about what *I* should be doing.

Got her number!,shakedown_st,15,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/rdqzt/went_out_alone_to_a_bar_for_the_mad_men_season_5/,"It's 12:15am, and I'm drunk, but I need to write this up while it's all still fresh in my mind. So I'm a big fan of the show Mad Men and was very much looking forward to the Season 5 premiere tonight. So I was thinking...I can watch this alone, laying on my bed...Or, I can look online and see if anyone is throwing a Mad Men Premiere watch party. Sure enough, a bar near Union Station was having one. To my surprise, it required tickets to attend. So I bought a $20 ticket that included an open bar from 7pm-9pm. Hell yes, I am doing this. **Remember, if you go out, you have a 1% chance of meeting someone. That is infinitely better than the 0% chance you have if you stay home.**

So I show up, decked out and looking good in a black button down, and pants I got yesterday from Banana Republic's Mad Men line. Perfect. It's 7:15pm and I'm at the bar drinking a whiskey neat. I'm in a great state of mind. I feel great, I look great, and I *was* great.

Then, all of a sudden, this stunning 5', 8"" blonde walks in, alone, like she was picked right out of 1960. She was wearing a genuine 1950s dress and jewelry. She was there alone and I can tell she was attracted to me right away because there were dozens of seats open at the bar but she sits at the one two down from me so there was only one seat open between us. Here I go.

The more I do this, the more I realize how unimportant openers are. You can say anything really that starts a conversation. A lot of Forever Aloners haggle about ""having nothing to say"". This is actually a bullshit excuse. Yeah, you can always use a canned opinion opener and that's fine, but really...Just say something. I ended up using a boring and awkward opener that just came to my head at that minute. 

*pick up my drink* ""Can't watch Mad Men without a whiskey neat in your hand""

She laughs and just starts talking to me. Within a minute I move to sit next to her. She was showing every single classic sign of attraction with regards to body language, and damn is she beautiful. Can't describe. She *loved* to talk. I just had to make some random statement and then she'd go on for 20 minutes. It was fantastic!

Best part: Tons of people showed up to this premiere party. Like 100+ at least, and I can tell every guy was staring at her. It felt great that I was the one that was holding her interest. I went up to go to the bathroom and she protected my seat while I was gone. I came back and there were three guys around her and she shooed them off when I came back. Then, she got up to go the bathroom and I was protecting her seat. The guy sitting to the left of her then turns to me and says, ""Hey man, she is fucking beautiful. Hang in there and keep up the great work."" Lol, wow.

We live one metro stop away from each other so I number closed and we acknowledged that we wanted to see each other again. I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and then she kissed my cheek too. 

I texted her when I got back just now and I hope to receive a response in the morning. We shall see. Will be disappointing if I don't, but it's always a possibility. At least I had a great night tonight. Will keep you all updated on this one.

I go out alone (again) to a concert I've been looking forward to. Just wanted to go and have a good time. The crowd is a much older crowd given the music I'm into, but there's the 2 or 3 others my age roaming around. I wasn't in the mood to approach anyone though so I didn't think anything was going to happen -- even though this one girl caught my eye.

The cute girl and I stood next to each other for like 90 minutes until the break. Our bodies kept bumping into each other as we moved to the beat, but I was still too chickenshit to do anything. Break comes and I step on something...It's an iPhone. I pick it up and turn to her and ask her if the phone is hers. It is -- so that was my opener (as cheap and lucky as it was...Hey, you'll take what you can get).

It dawns on me that this girl is high as a kite. I've never smoked weed in my life, but I don't judge those that do -- it's a personal choice and that's cool. But the conversation was actually going okay. I was initiating a lot of kino (touching), but she wasn't really reciprocating. Her other body language was open though and she was laughing at some of my jokes. Trying to pick up on indicators of interest was tricky because I wasn't sure if the girl's current altered state of consciousness would change how it all normally works. 

The show starts back up again and she kind of gets away from me. Now, if a girl is into you, it's not likely she'll just walk away and not hang with you for the rest of the time, but that's what this girl did. So I let it go, but eventually I kind of snuck my way up near her, but her friend was inbetween us and she wasn't making any effort to come to me. Game over.

It's the final song of the night and it's about half way over when she leans in to me and asks me if I like the song or not. Interesting. I say yeah, and then I grab her hand and say, ""wanna dance?""

She pulls back and shakes her head no. I say alright and give her a playful shove and turn my back to listen to the music again. 10 seconds later she leans in to me again and says, ""I kinda do actually, but no."" ...I have no idea what this means and was hoping some of you could help decipher it. Like she did want to dance with me, but didn't feel comfortable in the environment? Granted, no one else was really dancing. ...I don't know...I was all confused. Can't figure this girl out *at all*.

When the concert was over and people started filing out, I took a chance and asked her if she wanted to keep in contact. She responded with a definitive yes. Very cool. We exchange numbers and I texted her just now when I got back. She responded.

Hopefully I can turn this into a date!

**EDIT:** We texted Sunday and Monday, but this girl definitely isn't a good fit for me. She might be forever alone herself, I don't know, but the texts were too strange for me.

Well, for one, you could just go up to her, call her, or text her to schedule a date. But I know Forever Alones, and as simple and easy as this is...It's just difficult for Forever Alones to grow the balls necessary to do this. Eventually you will get here. I just recently got there myself, but it does take time.

Here is the method that Forever Alones can use to ask girls out without totally freaking out and making a big deal about it (FAs typically make a bigger deal about things than they need to). But first, real quick...You are asking the girl out - there is no way around that. It's not like you snap your fingers and she wants to go on a date with you - but the way you're doing it isn't *as nerve-wracking* as saying ""Hey let's go out"".

Enough delay, here's what you're going to do:

Find something *you* want to do. Even better if you can get 2 or 3 of your friends to do the activity with you. The important thing here is that it has to be something you are willing to do by yourself. If the activity is something that you would not do if your date was not there, than do not consider it an option. **Do not concern yourself with making her happy. Make yourself happy and if she wants to tag along, then all the better. If not, then you are still doing an activity that you want to do anyway.**

Now here's an important part. If you get 2 or 3 friends to do the activity with you, *do not tell her that your friends are coming*. This is extremely important.

Just text her, ""Hey, I'm going to watch the super bowl at [insert place here]. feel free to come."" or whatever activity it is that you're going to do. This method makes it seem like you're doing something fun and you're not asking her out, but if she wants to, she can join you.

If she agrees, then awesome -- you have a date. If she doesn't, follow through on your activity anyway because it's something you're doing for yourself! Not for her! If you completed Step 1 you will know exactly what I'm talking about.

Assuming she accepts the date, you'll feel more comfortable because you're doing something you enjoy -- making you seem cooler and more attractive. You'll become calmer and more comfortable around her as well, so that you won't be so scared to set up another date.

There you go. Have fun!

The present me is getting a boatload more numbers from women than previous me, but the overly philosophical side of previous me has shown himself to be a stubborn ass. Fear isn't the issue. I'm not afraid of fucking up on the first date and making a mockery of myself - that obstacle was obliterated a long time ago. It's just that the prospect of spending three hours talking about the same mundane crap comprising most of my conversations with people I've met in the past (including friends and ex-prospects) terrifies me. I mean, really, ain't nobody got time for that. I've spoken countless times about local cuisine, the countries I've visited, electro bands, and what have you. Now I feel like I'm just going through the motions and my mind starts wandering off to more interesting places. When I'm in the thick of this kind of conversation 30 minutes into my date, I start thinking ""FSM this is so boring - I'd rather be with my laptop at an indie cafe, coding away at a machine learning algorithm in Haskell"". Then I start getting antsy. Then I find a way to cut the date short and run home, screaming ""I need mental stimulation!"".

It's not just dates. I love electronic music and often visit clubs just to dance and experience the ambience with fellow electronerds. But the times I've been with friends who primarily want to get laid by the end of the night, I've acted fairly atypically for a 24 year old heterosexual guy. I'm intensely attracted to women on a sexual level, yet I don't feel like approaching them at all. The Chase seems really insipid to me. I can woo them if egged on by my friends, but I just come back with someone's number, playfully say ""how do you like them apples?"" and go back to dancing alone.

Still, I'm not happy. I'm happy when immersed in math/physics reading - that stuff is one of my reasons for living - but I know that I'm missing out on so much in life by passing upon relationships. Some of my most memorable experiences have been with friends. They've made the blandest surroundings come alive by just being there. I can't explain why this is so, but I can't deny it either. Generalizing this phenomenon to sexual relationships, it's clear that I need to change my mindset a little more if I truly want to get the most out of life.

I am a female friend who he has previously tried to date.

Let me start off. We've been friends since high school and after a rough break up in college he started to talk to me more than normal and showered me with small gifts. I thought it was really awkward and I figured it out rather quickly, so I told him that I wasn't interested before he tried to ask me out as a way to keep him from thinking I was friendzoning him. I thought it would be best to stop it as soon as possible, basically.

He still talks about how shitty it is that every girl he's ever asked out has rejected him and how ""you didn't even LET me ask you out"". I still think I made the right call on this, but it's irrelevant. In any case, he has asked me to help him by setting him up with a friend of mine, however most of my friends have partners. I've given him ideas to go to a concert, see a movie, go to a bar, something social that might let him meet women, but he rejects my ideas that he doesn't want to date someone that he would find from a bar/concert/etc ""scene"".

Bad things happen. Self-doubt and negative thoughts creep into your head. More bad things happen. More destructive thoughts enter your head. Rinse and repeat until the thoughts have become utterly pervasive and depressing. There have been times, triggered by rejection or lack of attention from a crush, that I have considered killing myself because I felt completely unwanted by all women. The overgeneralization and negative attitude that I displayed is just insane for me to think about now, but this very pattern of thought occurs in all sorts of people. It doesnât have to be that way though, and I feel much, much better now. To break this nasty cycle, a person needs to adjust in a healthy manner the way that his brain copes with these negative occurrences and future uncertainty. 

When something bad happens to the pessimist, his natural reaction is to find someone else to blame. He overgeneralizes and overextends the results of each negative experience to all of life. As a result, he learns nothing from his experiences and becomes very guarded in his future relationships, and those relationships suffer. If youâve read /r/foreveralone, you realize that these people are scared as hell, and many of them refuse to accept a proper level of personal responsibility for negative happenings. A pessimist gets blown out but by a crush, and thinks, âWhat about me is unattractive to everyone? What is wrong with the opposite sex/humanity? Itâs not fair that I am forever alone.â

When something bad happens to an optimist, he realizes that this was a single occurrence. He learns the lessons that need to be learned. To an optimist, life can hurt a lot sometimes, but he refuses to let a single event ruin his future. He has the ability to approach life with a healthy level of vulnerability, realizing that bad things may happen again in the future but unafraid of negative results. An optimist gets blown out by a crush, and thinks, âWhat about how I acted wasnât attractive to that one person? What are traits of that one person that I didnât like? What, if anything, can I learn from this experience that will help me in my next human relationship?â

It isnât at all easy to change the way your brain copes with negative experiences and future uncertainty. It takes a lot of practice to adjust your go-to maneuver. Quite often, an over-general, negative thought still slips into my brain. It is important, however, if you catch yourself overgeneralizing or becoming too paranoid about people or life, to take a step back and reevaluate the scenario from a healthier point of view. Thereâs no need to let your past experiences turn you into an afraid, insecure, unhappy human being. Learn what needs to be learned, and utilize this information to create a happier future. Your next crush might thank you for it. :)

It is a state of defeat. You have actually told yourself that you are alone forever and will be alone forever. Simply by thinking these thoughts, you have made this a reality. Your subconscious mind will not let you succeed because you believe yourself to be a failure. You believe that you deserve to be Forever Alone. 

Having said this, you are in this subreddit because you do not want to be Forever Alone anymore. But before you do anything, you have to genuinely change your thinking -- your thought process. You have to convince yourself that you are not forever alone. You have to change your 'state of mind'. By thinking more positively, you'll act more positively.

Read this book:
[No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=No+more+mr+nice+guy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)

This book represents nearly every single FA I encounter, including myself. It's a Nice Guy Syndrome and it accurately depicts what many FAs consider themselves -- Nice Guys, when in reality, it is indicative of other problems. You cannot proceed without changing your whole current mindset and this book will do that.

Here are two excerpts -- 

""Todd prides himself on treating women with honesty and respect. He believes these traits set him apart from other men and should attract women to him. Though he has many female friends, he rarely dates. The women he knows tell him what a great listener he is and often call him to share their problems. He likes feeling needed. These female friends constantly tell him what a great ""catch"" he will make for some lucky woman. In spite of the way he treats women, he can't understand why they all seem to be attracted to jerks, rather than Nice Guys like him""

Also this, ""The enmeshing Nice Guy makes his partner his emotional center. His world revolves around her. She is more important than his work, his buddies, his hobbies. He will do whatever it takes to make her happy. He will give her gifts, try to fix her problems, and arrange his schedule to be with her. He will gladly sacrifice his wants and needs to win her love. He will even tolerate her bad moods, rage attacks, addictions, and emotional or sexual unavailability -- all because he 'loves her so much'. On the surface it may appear that the enmeshing Nice Guy desires, and is available for an intimate relationship, but this is an illusion. The Nice Guy's pursuing and enmeshing behavior is an attempt to hook up an emotional hose to his partner. This hose is used to suck the life out of her and fill an empty place inside of him. The Nice Guy's partner unconsciously picks up on this agenda and works like hell to make sure the Nice Guy can't get close enough to hook up the hose. Consequently, the Nice Guy's partner is often seen as the one preventing the closeness the Nice Guy desires""

The above excerpts accurately described me, though there are various types of ""Nice Guys"". You have to change your attitude about what a Nice Guy is. You can be a nice person, but at the same time, be an attractive, assertive, and confident man. If you can't change your attitude on this, then you will not be able to rid yourself of your forever alone status. Do not sabotage yourself. Let yourself succeed.

Every week there will be required in depth reading, a personal challenge, and several confidence growing activities. Let me know if your interested.

I feel I've come a long way in the past 8 months. I was your average bear kissless 23 year old virgin. 2 weeks ago I made out with 3 different girls in one night, and I didn't even try really. I'm not saying this is a marker of success or something that happens regularly, but I think it's an interesting result. Probably won't do that again. It was fun, but it ruined for what could have been a lot more productive friend making with lots of other people. Problem now is new people I meet think that's what I'm like. Also, I am not taking this any amount of seriously, I'm just having fun learning, and seeing what I can do. I am not expecting anything, and not trying for anything.

I am still just as nerdy as I've always been I feel like, and I still have streaks of awkwardness, but that is also getting better. I'm also getting better at gauging and reading into the situation if there is anything there, and it doesn't bother me if something doesn't work out the way I hoped. I recently met this really cool girl, one of the very few I have ever felt a serious interest in. I tried to keep in contact with her somehow, then made a lot of rookie mistakes, but turns out she's mainly into the big, tall bro-y type party guys, so it was not something for me anyway. The point is, this might have bothered me before, but as of the current situation, I don't really care. I'm short, pretty nerdy, fit, and I have my audience, which I accept. I would still very much have liked keeping her as a friend, which might still be salvagable, but I'm not sure as I feel like I fucked up pretty badly.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I just thought I'd post some thoughts. I have had nowhere near the success and change of mr Shakedown, but I'm happy to see things improve and change for something better.

That's all well and good, but I'm finding it really hard to be interested in most people - and by most I mean something like 99%. This isn't just a case of non-overlapping interests. I tend to become almost irritably bored even with people who share my interests. If they're not funny, witty, enlightening, supremely intelligent, or adventurous, I want no part of conversation with them. Sure, small-talk is a necessary evil, but interaction of more substance still doesn't do anything to make things enjoyable.

I want to change. Ideally, my threshold for thinking ""cool story, bro"" would be much lower than it currently is. I want to be as easily captivated as most people, because my inability to be so is the biggest obstacle between me and social success. I was at a pub last week with otherwise intelligent guys, and even talk about beer and tech startups (two things I'm really interested in) didn't stave off ennui. This is also an impediment for romantic relationships, since sex will be one of the few things that will make time spent with any potential girlfriend interesting.

I've been making small changes, and for the most part it seems to be working. Most of my family seems to notice a more positive attitude, I'm making an effort to smile more, and I'm trying to be more open to breaking my normal routine. I know I still have a long way to go, but it certainly beats where I was a few months ago.

I had an interesting experience this weekend when I decided to go golfing with my brother. Now, I had been playing a short course for a few months but this was my first time in a couple of years that I was playing a full 18 holes. Well, the first nine holes were a disaster. Neither of us could hit anything with our drivers, we were getting frustrated, and they didn't spread out the tee times well so we were constantly worrying about holding people up. We actually wound up skipping a hole because we were so worried that were were inconveniencing everyone.

After the front nine, my brother and I were both exceedingly frustrated. To top it off, our confidence was totally blown since we hadn't had a good tee shot all day.  We took a short break waiting to start on the 10th hole and I recognized how stupid we were being. We paid for golf. The people behind us didn't matter. The people in front of us didn't matter. Nobody else on the course should have any bearing whatsoever on our overall mood. We had a little pep talk, and we both decided we were going to ""honey badger"" the last 9 holes. Furthermore, I made the suggestion that we should switch to irons only for the last 9, rather than use our drivers. The difference was like night and day. We had an absolute blast on the back 9, hit for nearly par on every hole, and had some of our best shots of the day. And even when the shots were bad, we still laughed about it and had a good time.

In hindsight, that's something good to remember. As an FA, it becomes really easy to base your actions and feelings on somebody else. You have to remember that this is your life, not someone else's. When you let someone else decide your emotions, they control you. It's also good to remember that sometimes, confidence can be found in doing what you do well. Maybe it's gaming, playing a sport, or even cooking. Everybody in the world is damn good at something. When you're out of your element, or trying something completely new, it's tough to keep confidence and you *can't* always project your confidence in one thing onto another. As confident as I was in my irons, I can't just project that onto my driver (different swing, different mechanic) and do better. Some things only come with practice and familiarity. *But*, remembering that you're damn good at other things helps to keep you positive or can provide a different approach when you're struggling with something new.

Well... That was longer than I expected. I hope someone actually takes the time to read it.

Learn to get rejected and blown out. If you complete step 3, then you have told yourself that you are committed to ending your FA status. If you do not complete step 3, then you're kidding yourself. You're setting yourself up for failure. There is no way you're going to succeed in making friends and meeting girls/guys if you do not learn how to get rejected and not give a fuck. Even if you skip this step and go ahead and read all the books on socializing there is, you still won't get anywhere. Learn to give 0 fucks.

This is one of the scariest things I've ever done for myself, but I knew deep down I needed to do it. I went to a bar with two friends and I told them to force me to approach women. Forget ""game"" or what's right or wrong to do...None of that matters. I knew nothing about what to do or how to approach people at this point, and I'm assuming you don't either. The important thing is that you simply approach. No matter what happens, approach.

So I went to this bar with my two friends and I approached 15 girls and got rejected by every single one of them. I had no idea what to do and looking back on it I made a complete fool of myself. I approached one girl, froze up in what I was saying and just stood there...The guy next to her called me out on it - ""Hey, your game is weak man. You can't hesitate like that,"" and then proceeded to inform me (in front of the girl mind you) how she rejected me without even saying a word. 

I approached another girl when the bar was playing, ""Fuck you"" song and the girl actually started dancing with me...Then my friend walked up to her and said, ""Has he warned you about his STD?"" I don't have an STD and I don't know why my wingman would do that. In either case, the rejection was still good to get.

At the end of the night...Yeah, got rejected by 15 girls and felt like shit about myself. But guess what, it was the best thing I'd ever done. It was huge in learning how to handle my fear when approaching someone new.

I learned how to get rejected. 

Go get rejected by approaching at least 10 girls in a single night. The size of your balls will increase substantially. And if you're a girl, approach 10 guys. Approach each person with the intention of getting blown out. Come back here, post what happened and we'll congratulate you.

I've been lurking here for a while now, so I think it's time for me to put my two cents in. Strap in for this wonderful, fun filled adventure and follow me!
Ok here we are! So first off, this advice is for runners. Are you a runner? No?!  Why aren't you! Go put your running shoes on and run a mile. What? No running shoes?! Run to the store and buy some running shoes, then run back! I'll wait. 
Are you back? Excellent. Good job by the way, that was a great first run. So what is the advice? Well, about three months ago I started giving people high-fives as I run. I started out giving high-fives to other runners at first, but soon I expanded my outreach(get it?) to non-runners as well. Now if I see anyone heading towards me I look at them, smile, and offer a high-five. Why do I do that? Why not just run silently or throw out a simple ""howyoudoing"" ? Several reasons:
1) High-fiving people means that you have to take that extra step to be outgoing; to reach out to a complete strangers to greet them. 
2) Physical contact, however small and brief. A lot of people are averse to touching other people, even if it's a simple high-five, simple because they think that the other person will reject them or think that they are weird, or heavens no, calls the police and yells rape or something. High-fiving people is a socially acceptable way to break the fear of physical contact with others. 
3) People LOVE it! Almost every person I offer a high-five to, smiles after I pass them. Many people don't realize what I want from them, even though I'm pretty clear when I yell out ""HIGH-FIVE!"" with a stupid grin on my face, and simply wave at me. A lot of times we miss. That usually happens with white people. (By the way if you are offended that I made a white people joke, it's ok, both my parents happen to be white, plus it's true.) 
4) It puts people outside of their comfort zone, but not too much, and I love seeing it. When I started, the purpose of this exercise was to put me out of my comfort zone. That is no longer the case. I love watching people as I run up to them. I can read on their face and in their eyes the fear of social interaction. They're thinking ""Please just run by and don't say anything, pretend I'm not here. I'm just going to make myself as small as possible and scoot out of your way."" Nooooo way, sweet old lady! WE'RE HIGH-FIVING! And it's great for all parties involved. 9 people like that out of 10 get a smile on their face, even if they choose not to high-five. It's painless, it's friendly, and someone recognized them as a fellow human being instead of just another obstacle on the road. 
5) It actually give me a boost. I notice that I speed up just a little after I get a high-five. Weird, huh?
Here are some tips on high-fiving strangers when you run:
1) DO NOT scare people. 
2) Let them know ahead of time that you see them by making eye contact, and that you are friendly by smiling. Smiling was a big thing for me to work on, because as Shakedown can attest, I don't smile. Ever. 
3) Give them sufficient time to react to your high-five. Don't spring it on them at the last second. 
4) Announce the high-five loud enough for them to hear, but do not yell it out too loud. A lot of people listen to music and might not hear you. 
5) Don't put your hand in their face. Respect personal space. Keep in mind you are running. You don't want to hit someone with the full running momentum.
6) Don't take it personal if they reject you. Some people will nod, many will wave, many will high five. A lot of times I pass someone without a high five and they realize it a second too late and I hear ""Ooooh..."". I love it.
7) Have fun. That's what it's all about. 

Now you might be thinking: ""It's so insignificant, why tell us about this?"" Well, it's the little things that change you. For instance what tipped the scales for me was [the task # 1 of Project Mayhem] (http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/rtfdf/projectmayhem_task_1_order_a_big_mac_from_any/) . It was such an easy task, just order a Big Mac at Subway or something. It was a huge step for me. My heart was pounding, I felt incredibly nervous, I almost chickened out. Now, pffft, whatever, I can even put on a show and demand to see a manager, and do whole improve routine on why I must get the Big Mac immediately. Same thing with this, first time- very nervous, had to convince myself to do it. After getting two-three high-fives I was the king of the world. Now, it's just a part of who I am.

It involves the concept of people wanting things that are rare. The goal is for *you* to be rare, which is the opposite of being common, or easily available. 

Iâll start off with a personal story. It was the summer of 2008, and I had just gotten out of a serious three-year long relationship. I was too young to settle down, and was eager for the next chapter of my life to begin. I packed my things, moved to a new city, and enrolled in a summer class at the local university. I moved into a dorm-style housing complex, specially selected because it was filled with people from all different walks of life. The last thing I wanted was to get into another serious relationship. I met many interesting people that summer, girls and guys. Some of the guys expressed interest in me, but none of them interested me. There was one guy in particular who called me constantly, wrote things on the whiteboard outside my room, and was just overall, incredibly needy. Oh, and he told me I reminded him of his ex-girlfriend. The worst thing was he would not take my firm hints that I was not interested. I thought he was a pretty good-looking guy, but all the attention was a boner-killer (if I could have boners.) Not only did I want to be free at that stage in my life, I REALLY didnât want someone who was that intense and easily available. 

Then there was this other guy. Iâd met him early on in the summer, and we had talked briefly, probably in the elevator or something. He had a very nonchalant, carefree attitude about him. The âI donât really give a fuck about what you think about meâ kind of attitude. He wasnât rude at all, just independent and confident about himself. As the summer progressed, we saw each other sometimes in passing. At some point in time, we starting hanging out more with some friends we had in common. I got to know him better, and I knew he was the type of guy I could never have an actual relationship with. He had a reputation as a player, but it was unclear which girls he was actually sleeping with, which I liked because I value discretion. He did not kiss and tell. He did not act like an asshole. He never explicitly made a move on me, but I could tell from the way he acted that he wouldnât mind having, um, sexual relations with me. He wasnât creepy about it at all. The ball was in my court. If I wanted to, fine, if not, also fine. There were lots of other girls in the world. It was this specific attitude that made me decide I wouldnât mind having a fling with him. So I did. 

Different variations of the same story have happened a few times in my life. When I was younger, I would get crushes on these types of guys, but it didnât take me long to realize that while good for a fling, I would never be happy in a long-term relationship with someone like that. Really liking someone who has no real interest in reciprocating your interest, besides to sleep with you, is a waste of time and the emotional fuckery that comes along with it is not worth it for me. I long ago adopted the attitude that if Iâm into someone, and theyâre not into me, itâs not worth my time to pursue it. I have difficulty understanding girls who pine over guys who give them the bare minimum of attention to keep them around. You know that book, âHeâs Just Not That Into Youâ? Iâve loaned that book to a few of my girl friends. I only wish there was one called âSheâs Just Not That Into You,â because many of the points also apply to guys. Nice guys who donât quite know how to attract girls, and end up getting friend-zoned. 

Ironically, oftentimes the people who want the most to be in a relationship are the ones who have the most difficult time finding someone. Iâm sure you know guys who are just looking to get laid, like this guy in the dorm, and have no intentions of having meaningful relationships with the women they have sex with. Doesnât it suck that these same men are the ones who can get a womenâs attention? While you, with the best of intentions, knowing you could be such a good partner to someone, gets passed over. Yeah.  

So this goes back to my point about being rare/less available. One of the things that can help with attraction is to create mystery, or a sense of the unknown. If a woman can tell that she can just have you, it makes things less interesting for her. Itâs not the same as her playing games (which I think is stupid). It could be a totally subconscious feeling. Itâs about having a challenge. Working for it. Wanting something that is a little out of reach. For instance, say thereâs a shiny new Apple iThing out, and itâs a limited edition with only 50 available within 1000 miles of you. Imagine that this iThing only costs $20. The emphasis is not about the cost, itâs about how few of them are available. You really really want it. You line up for hours in the rain outside the Apple store, and youâre like the 49^th person in line. You end up getting one of these elusive things, and youâre elated. Now be honest, would you have liked that thing as much if there were millions available, like they were handing them out in Happy Meal boxes at McDonaldâs? Itâs possible yes, but probably less likely. People like challenges. You woke up early, waited outside in the fucking rain, and you got your iThing. The reward is so much sweeter. 

Now think of yourself as the iThing. Are you a limited edition, or are you the Happy Meal? When you meet a new woman, do you make it obvious that youâre into her? Does she know she can easily have you? Do you wait for her after the end of each class, check in everyday at work to see if she wants to have lunch with you, pass by her desk a lot for no real reason, or stalk the whiteboard outside her dorm room? Or, if youâre at a bar, do you buy all her drinks, laugh at all her jokes, donât leave her side, and compliment her endlessly? If so, you are the Happy Meal edition. STOP doing all that. Youâre trying too hard. (If youâve heard anything about dating techniques and think Iâm about to suggest âneggingâ or any of that other bullshit that preys on a womanâs self-esteem, think again. That stuff is manipulative and stupid, whether or not it works.) 

So what are you supposed to do if you donât try to get her attention all the time? Isnât she going to just... not notice you? No. Make sure she knows you exist, but casually. Are you working on a project together? Great, talk to her like youâd talk to any of the other people working on the same project. Walk past her desk and ask her a question if you must, but make sure itâs a real question you actually care about and think she can assist you in. (If youâre at a bar, the situation is a little trickier, because if you donât say something to her, she might never notice you. A future post will talk about this, including a low-risk technique to start a conversation with a girl without being explicitly rejected.) As long as she has an idea of who you are, youâve made a point already. Donât shower her with endless attention. Be chill. Please, relax. I donât know why guys think that if they show tons and tons of interest, the girl is going to be like âWow, heâs so into me! This makes me really want him too!â I guess itâs logical, but unfortunately it doesnât work that way. Youâre too easy. To predictable. Happy Meals. Some girls probably like that, yes, but I have a feeling most do not. 

Sounds pretty easy, right? You just take a step back, let her know you exist, and sheâs going to run into your arms. Sure, if youâre lucky. It might never happen. With the guy at the dorm, I totally could have decided that I didnât want to have a fling with him. I might not have been attracted to him physically, or I only do serious relationships, or maybe I was saving myself for marriage. There could be a million reasons. *You have to be prepared for the possibility that sheâs just not into you. Donât take it personally.* Donât overinvest in her, even if youâre secretly pining for her while attempting to act nonchalant. How do you do this? Well, this is the harder part. You actually need to change your mindset and your expectations. *I am not here to find a relationship. I am not here to find a girlfriend. If I meet interesting people and have a good time, that is enough.* If you tell yourself this and genuinely believe it, then 1) You wonât be disappointed and depressed if you donât meet a woman, and 2) Women (or the person youâre crushing on) will notice that you are not acting overly eager (ie. desperate) to win their attention and they might start wondering about you. You ARE the limited edition. All the other guys who are crowding them at Fridayâs employee Happy Hour or trying to sit at the same lunch table as them all the time are predictable and boring. Why arenât you vying for their attention? Itâs not so much that youâre making them feel insecure about themselves by intentionally not giving them attention, itâs more like, âI could have any one of these guys in an instantâ (Happy Meals), or âThis other guy is pretty chill, I wonder what heâs like?â 

Youâve created mystery and a sense of the unknown by projecting that you donât give two shits if she talks to you or not. The most important thing is you must genuinely train yourself not to care. *I am not here to find a relationship.* Be casual. See how it goes. If sheâs interested, great. If not, still great - you got to meet someone new, and maybe even made a new friend. Eventually, you will find someone who reciprocates your interest in a romantic way. In summary: Donât expect to meet someone each time you go out. Go out to meet interesting people, not just women. Donât overinvest in someone who is not invested in you. Most of all, just relax and be casual.

Quick update -- I'm still seeing the girl, though I think she likes me a lot more than I like her. The sex is great, but I'm just not feeling that emotional connection. And that's really what we all want as Former FAs. We crave sex, but what we really want is to feel connected to others. So we'll see where it goes. I'm just not ready to dive in with full commitment to her right now.

Anyway, that brings me to this post on neediness. Neediness is the #1 attraction killer - HANDS DOWN. Even if you change nothing about yourself, but become less 'needy', you will see some results and improvement with your success with women.

I have seen it time and time again. Guys (and especially FAs here), think that if they cater to their crush's every single need, she will like him because he is a ""nice guy"". This is simply not true. And when I began to realize this, my success with women really started to happen. Now before you take out pitchforks, I'm not advocating that you be an asshole. Quite the contrary. Just don't be needy. [Here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ryUU3gYi) is a real conversation I had with a female friend a few nights ago.

I think that conversation is great because it truly illustrates that girls don't want that needy guy. So here are some points to ponder:

* **Do not smother her**

* **Do not re-arrange your entire schedule just to be with her. She will pick up on this and it will come across as you not having a life and being needy. You have things to do? Priorities? Tell her that you need to schedule a better time to see each other because you have important things to take care of. *It's actually a good thing to be unavailable**

* **Do not feel that you need to talk to her every day. You don't. You are a busy man and you have important things to do in life.**

* **Do not feel like you need to buy her gifts all the time on seemingly random occasions. Believe it or not, writing a card will give her the same level of emotion as if you bought her 2 dozen roses.**


Those points helped me the most, but here are some other rules of thumb that are pretty good. 

* Let her text you more than you text her.
* If she doesn't respond to your text for a few hours, don't respond right away either. I typically wait twice as long to respond back then she did. She waited an hour to respond? I'll wait 2 hours. Sometimes I won't text back for a day.
* Do not do this: ""You free Friday night? No? Saturday night? No? How about Sunday? ...Monday? ...Tuesday? ...I'm actually free every single night so tell me when we can meet."" -- I have seen guys do this and it is painful to watch.
* Do not tell her that she is only one you are pursuing. She secretly wants to know that other girls are going after you too, and that she's lucky for having the chance to get to know you.
* Do not cater to her every need. If you're in the middle of something and your crush calls you because she needs to cry about the latest guy who rejected her, tell her you can't talk. Do not drop whatever it is that you're doing because whatever you are doing is important because you are a busy man with things to do.

So there you go. I felt this post was a long-time coming. Talk to you all soon.

You plan and overthink. That's what you do and that's what you've always done. **It is time to put an end to this right now.**

I'm really digging this improv stuff. Not necessarily the act of finding an improv group and performing in front audiences, but simply applying the ideals of improv to your daily life. Because there are benefits to it.

The core of improv is ""Yes and..."" If someone says something, you simply agree with whatever it is and continue the story in that direction. 

""Let's go to the river""

""Yes and we'll rent a canoe""

""Yes and we'll paddle towards the waterfall""

""Yes and we'll plunge a hundred feet!""

""Yes and we'll jump out with our parachutes""

""Yes and we'll fly to Antarctica""

This is just a dumb example I came up with right now, but you get the idea. Start ""Yes and"" -ing in your real life. You'll find that you'll just go along with the flow and people will like you more for it. Agree to everything (within reason)! Do this for a week and see if you end up doing some things or meeting people you wouldn't normally have otherwise. People who draw their happiness from within themselves are positive and say Yes to things. People who are depressed and reaction-seeking are negative and say No to things. Remember, people are drawn to positive and value-giving individuals.

I've changed a lot of things about myself not just concerning my appearance. You would figure that this would have a positive impact on my social life would it not? Especially when I go out of my way to make sure social situations occur. 

Here's the problem though: When I look in the mirror or reflect on my overall accomplishments I think ""Great! I have plenty of reason to be confident now."" But when I go out and try to apply this confidence, instead of it reflecting positively on the results, it has the opposite effect. 

I figured now that I'm not severely underweight, I have more practice speaking, I speak less quietly, I have lots of life experience and a broad range of topics to talk about etc... That all of this would translate into me being more liked, or at least less hated. But it doesn't... I'm still a nobody.

And thus my confidence gets shot down. How improved do I have to be for people to accept me? How good is good enough... Why do I have to be the Dean's list, debtless, carefree, courteous, athletic, chill etc... guy, when everybody else gets by with being average and talking about drinking and skipping class and needing a tutor.

I honestly wish I could just trade places with any of the seemingly average people I see. If it weren't for me naturally enjoying the things I do, it wouldn't be worth the effort I put into my personal being. It would be so much easier if I were to be liked for being one of them. 

I am vilified by strangers, walked on, taken advantage of, prejudged, led on, and avoided by people who won't even give me a chance. I don't even think it can be my personality because people start off treating me like this before introductions are finished. 

People are rude to me. I'd much rather stay here in my apartment alone for 16 hours a waking day than have to interact with the strangers who predetermine that I'm some shitbag worthless loser who sucks at all aspects of life. 

No matter how I try to better myself, nothing changes with the way people treat me. Actually I take that back, as I've gotten stronger more men try to pick fights with me. The rest of me, the intellectual side, is hidden behind a veil of forced introversion that I keep getting thrown behind no matter the velocity I break though it at.

At the very least, do you need to fight back insulting the other person as a joke in order for it to not be submissive?

These things aren't constructive criticism either. They tend to use derogatory terms which are unnecessary for communicating constructive criticism. The way it's treated as a joke also seems to prevent it from becoming motivation for self improvement.

I'm afraid of being the guy who just sits there and listens to other people talking and then getting left behind.  Hoping to make new friends/contacts by going out with new people.  Anything I should remember when I'm out there?  Advice?  I'm 22 BTW.

[edit incase anyone looks at this so long after]

In the past I would get cold feet about going out to do stuff and I would just stay at home.  When I was invited to come out I was excited at first, but then I regretted saying I'd go sometimes, so I came on here.  

I got to a bar I've never been to, but people seem to like and one guy left a half finished beer behind because he was tired, and others were running late, so it was just her and her boyfriend, whom I'd met before.  To my good fortune, me and him hit it off pretty well.  

After I ordered a drink, the three of us chatted about interests (science podcasts, podcasts in general, music &gt; trip-hop, work, what part of town we live in, etc.)  She mentions to her boyfriend that she was ""trying to be friends with me for a long time but I was 'too professional' at work"".  After a while one of the birthday girl's friends shows up with her boyfriend who's younger and didn't talk so much.  Then three more girls show up  with another guy.  I couldn't really talk to the new girls because they were sitting right up behind me.  I tried to talk to the other guy, but unlike the boyfriend he wasn't really helping the conversation along.  We all decide it's getting too crowded in the corner we had claimed, and moved down the street to another bar.  

I make some chatter with the others at this bar, but it was smaller, louder, and more crowded than the other bar, it was like a tunnel to a hallway that connected to another bar and a nightclub.  Some girl recognized me because she was my sister's friend a long time ago, but I didn't remember her (and I still don't because I forgot her name).  

We move into the other bar, which is less crowded and I chat with bday girl's boyfriend some more about what kinds of drinks we like and how these bars are set up and he asks if I'd want to hang out some time, and we exchange numbers.  (Awesome, I haven't done that in so long).  Boyfriend and I head over to the 3 girls and the 2 other guys who're playing foosball.  As boyfriend leaves to go to the bathroom.  The guy who left earlier shows up, and I had met him a few times before, so I talk to him about music because he said he was working on putting some stuff together.  Then the b-day girl comes back kinda buzzed and thanks me for coming out and tells me she's not feeling tipsy, and so I buy her a shot.  We meet up with boyfriend and she gets her camera out and starts taking pictures with everyone.  After my pic I get pulled over to the foosball table for a game.  I'm kinda buzzed at this point, but I was taking it easy because I didn't want to get stupid drunk.  We have fun with the game, but we couldn't tell who one because only half the score counters were still there.

End up chatting with the guy that left earlier, the boyfriend, and the quieter guy as the bar started getting ready to close up.  We leave about fifteen after they close and head out to the street.  One of the guys really wants a hot dog from a vendor on the street.  And then we cross the street and the b-day girl's ex-bf apparently showed up out of nowhere and she started talking to him.  I didn't feel I should be there so I left, apparently he left soon after and nobody stayed so b-day girl ended up crying because she couldn't find anyone not even her boyfriend and there's this guy who's talking to her when we find her.  So boyfriend comes up, we kinda push the other guy away and he starts complaining about not being appreciated.

We're waiting for b-day girl and boyfriend to finish their drama while the one guy eats his hot dog.  We were gonna go to hot-dog guy's house, but b-day girl and boyfriend decide it's time to call it a night.  I end up going to the guy's house anyway and we hung out for about an hour before it we decided it was time to go home and go to sleep.



I don't normally go out like that, but I had a lot of fun.  I was more honest and confident about my interests and what I had to say when talking, and I think that made a difference.  I wish I had given more attention to the other people in the group, but whatever.  I went out there, that's what matters, and I was actually able to get so far as to have someone say they want to hang out with me.  

The b-day girl's boyfriend ended up texting me the next day and apologized for the drama, and that we should meet up some time.  I invited him and the girl to a friend's b-day party she said I could invite people to (because we have the same b-day).

I would classify myself as an INTP. I'm generally happy about who I am, I can easily talk to strangers (of any gender), I've asked some girls out on a date (most turned me down, those I did go out on a date with turned out to not be such a good match after all). I know what I'm good at, and I'm fairly confident as long as I have a clue what I'm doing, but when it comes to asking girls out I'm more on thin ice. I think I might be coming on too strong, I read somewhere that it's a good idea to give multiple options when asking a girl out, such as ""wanna go see the new movie? We can ask if &lt;other friends&gt; want to join us?"", I've not done something like that before and guess that's one of my errors.

A bit about her:
This one is slightly hard, as she's a bit secluded and doesn't reveal a lot about herself, but I recently learned she has played the piano for many years and obviously is rather good at it since she has held concerts in the past. We share some common interests so I do meet her every now and then. When we meet we usually talk, but I'm rather bad at reading whether girls are just being nice or are interested.

This turned out to be much harder than I anticipated. I'm falling short of knowing what to write, if you like, you can AMA and I'll try to fill in the gaps.
Despite having some common interests, we pretty much have no common friends (both being introverted does make this harder), so the ""asking someone out, optionally bringing other friends""-tactic would be difficult. I believe she still play the piano at concerts, so I'm contemplating whether it's a good idea to say something like ""are you going to play the piano somewhere? I'd like to hear you play"" (which also would be true, I do play some piano myself, but not at that level), is that a good idea?

I'd just like your thoughts, what should I do to figure out if she has any interest for me, and what should I do to suggest for her that I have some interest for her?

I really began my journey when I was 20. I'm 26 now. One thing that helped me a lot was self hypnosis. It relaxed me and it helped me move towards my social goals. Now, hypnosis wasn't my only tool, but it was an important one.

What motivated me to post this here was the recent AMA by the world record holder for longest breath held (22 something minutes). He mentioned that before he did a record attempt, he'd already successfully done it in his head a thousand times.

Initially, I required external stimulus such as hypnosis audios to get into a hypnotized state. Now, after doing it so long, I can hypnotize myself by simply lying down and concentrating.
What it initially helped me achieve was to learn how to relax, I did the whole positive thought placement thing but it wasn't until recently that I discovered the true power of it.


I've become very good at visualization. Now, when I hypnotize myself, I visualize and actually act out in my brain how I want to look and behave. At work, in social situations, while running with women etc... Just being able to actually visualize your potential self does wonders for you. The more focused and real your visualizations are, the more they stick in your brain and affect your daily life.

If you know nothing about hypnosis, I'd recommend starting here. It's been years since I've used this, but I found this again because I remembered the british accent.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rV00Q_8kYk

I have tried online dating for the past year or so. I've sent a lot of messages out, got a few replies, even a couple sent to me which is a nice confidence boost, but they've never gone anywhere therefore I've not met anyone this way. I don't think it's that great.

I don't have that many friends, but I go out with them at least a few times a month and mainly to pubs and hang out. I notice attractive girls out that I'd like to talk to at other tables and stuff, but I don't - and my reasons are; I'm sure they don't want to be bothered by a random guy when they're out with their friends as they probably get that all the time. What the hell would I say to them? I'll probably just seem like a creep. And I'm out with my friends. I don't want to blow them off when we're hanging out together as that's just shitty. Might be worth mentioning here that I have about the same male to female friend ratio?

At friend's get togethers and things like that where you do get to meet new people, I'll try to be sociable to everyone. My SA has been something I've been working on and it's improved (even though I can still relate to every SAP comic). But if one of these people happens to be someone I'm interested in, I'll talk to them as if I would to anyone else. I don't flirt, when I probably should because I wouldn't know how, and I convince myself that it wouldn't be mutual. Again, the guilt kicks in that I'd be appearing misogynistic concerned that they'd be thinking I'm hitting on them and being a creep. So they just become another friend or acquaintance rather than being seen as a potential dating partner or w/e. I tried once asking someone I became friendly with out shortly after I met them, but it didn't happen. (long story) We're good friends now and I got over the whole romantically interested thing quickly which there was no point in dwelling over.

Even elsewhere when I'm out alone in a shop or cafe or something. *Sees someone attractive. Doesn't talk to them.* Same reasons as above. But also kind of to do with the fact I'm not the type of person to randomly strike up a conversation with anyone. 

As for my dating history, I've only really 'been' with one person who was in my group of friends. And that was for about a month. She thought I was cute and I was totally oblivious to her flirting - it had to be pointed out to me. But I only really went along with it because I didn't have the heart to reject her, and thought I couldn't afford to do that as that would be my only chance of being with someone. And still thought that was my only chance a long time after it was decided best that we stayed just friends. But as fucked up as that was back then, I could take plenty from that for next time... which hasn't happened.

But to conclude, I really don't want to be forever alone. Just like everyone else here. I'm definitely willing to do whatever help gets thrown my way as it's down to me to do it and change that myself.

Hey Im 23, single for all of my time on this planet. Im usually pretty ok with my situation until someone brings up the topic (Thanks mom) but now Im feeling pretty shit. When I'm comfortable I can seem pretty confident but Im not at all. Close friends are usually surprised when I admit my perpetual single status and lack of confidence. 

Now I'm not ugly. But I'm not a model. Surfing keeps me fit. (Maybe too fit?) Closet nerd, with an array of hobbies and activities that keep me happy. I'm a nice girl, and will talk to anyone that approaches. But I tend to be sarcastic in nature. Probably as a defense mechanism. I told one of my friends that I was feeling self conscious about myself and he said that he and others loved my personality.

But I feel like one of the guys. 

I'm not a flirt. I don't wear makeup and I prefer comfortable clothing over anything else. When I'm around a guy I like, I get so nervous I get quiet and almost stutter when I speak. I've been hurt alot in the past, by letting someone into my life who seemed to be interested in me and they just shed that nice guy facade and just prove they just want sex. I like nice guys, but its such an easy act. I can't recognize flirting from guys either. 

I also tend to be super adventurous and rash in that I'll just up and do something or go somewhere for shits and giggles. (Currently living in Australia, on a whim) 

Another supposed bad thing is that a good lot of my friends are guys. I just get on better with them. But my old roommate told me I would emasculate him. He grew up to be chivalrous, I grew up to be independent. He would ask if he could carry something and it would bug him when I would decline. Im just used to handling my own shit.

So Im curious if some of these things are really important. The sarcasm. The fact that I don't flirt or aren't girly with shit like makeup and clothes. Being a bit adventurous.

Mainly, I'm 20, in college, and working. Most of the people I work with have 5+ years on me, and have their own lives. Speaking of work, I usually work 35-40 hours a week, and get my schedule on a weekly basis, so it's a pain in the ass to plan ahead. That being said, if you'd read my previous posts, I avoid emotional contact. I have a solid theory as to why I do it, but it doesn't help when I'm trying to overcome it much. I pretty much ignore/am oblivious to most *hints* girls seem to (Possibly?) throw at me. 

How do I make friends? I never get asked to go anywhere with people, although I talk with people a lot. I guess people assume I'm a weird guy or have my own life, because people rarely ask me about my life or get invited to anything. I have no problem talking to girls and asking people out and what not, I just don't know anyone who's not dating or isn't a co-worker. 

Another problem I face is my moods. I tend to go from being somewhat happy (more of a calm feeling) to depressed. I only started getting depressed the past two months or so, and it's not severe, it's just a down feeling. I'd like to think I'm reasonably attractive, but not sure, just because I've gotten two compliments that I can remember, both being about how much weight I've lost since I started working, so I have no idea how I look to other people.

EDIT: I'm drunk! Here's the debrief.

I head to Local 16 around 9pm. A bar I like in the U st corridor. Chill place. I get a beer and I'm just chilling at the bar. I approach two girls standing next to me, make small talk for a couple minutes but it's not going anywhere. Convo dies. Literally, seconds later, I get a txt message from a friend (girl) who I knew from when I studied abroad in Dublin. She's in town for the night and wants to hang with me and a friend she's bringing. I tell her to meet me at Local 16

She shows up with her friend...Her friend is freakin gorgeous. Wow! And she's from Long Island too so we hit it off right away. I haven't seen my friend in 2 years so we're having a great time reminiscing. I run some of the fun games I got in the arsenal and we are enjoying ourselves. Her friend is into me as I can tell from her body language. We hit a couple bars and I tell a bunch of stories, etc. All in all great night

When I walk them back to their metro stop, I number close the friend telling her I'll be up in Long Island in a month or so and we should hang out. 

So there you go. Went out with 0 expectations -- ended up meeting an old friend and a new, super attractive girl who I have a chance of meeting up with when I visit my friends and fam back on long island.

1327778964.0,10,self.faimprovement,p0rih,Do not seek external validation or reaction.,shakedown_st,14,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/p0rih/do_not_seek_external_validation_or_reaction/,"One huge obstacle I have been working to overcome in the last few weeks is trying not to seek external validation or a reaction from the girl that you like. What do I mean by this? Okay, picture this conversation that I had a few weeks ago with a girl.

&gt;Me: Looks like you got yourself a boyfriend and won't be single for Valentine's day. Congrats!

&gt;Her: I know! I'm so happy. Not sure what's going to happen, but it looks promising.

&gt;Me: Yeah, I don't think I'll be so lucky.

&gt;Her: You're getting better. You're such a great catch. It's only a matter of time.

This is called reaction-seeking and seeking external validation. While not even aware of it at the time, the line, ""Yeah, I don't think I'll be so lucky"" was essentially baiting her to say something nice about me. This is awfully unattractive in a man. Avoid making statements like these in the future. **You don't need a girl's validation to make yourself feel better**

This book, [The Way of the Superior Man](http://www.amazon.com/Way-Superior-Man-Spiritual-Challenges/dp/1591792576), has been very enlightening. This is page 48

Perhaps you have been working toward some financial goal, and finally you have succeeded. After months or years of effort, you have creatively earned a large amount of money. You feel happy, full, successful. You feel great. You come home to your woman and want to share the news with her.

""I just made a million dollars today""

""That's nice""

""That's nice?!?! You know how hard I've been working for this.""

""I know. It feels like I haven't seen you in months. Did you remember to pick up the milk on the way home?""

""Oh, sorry. I forgot. But who cares? We could buy a dairy farm now!""

""I asked you to pick up the milk three times this morning, and I put a note on your briefcase. How could you forget?""

""I said I'm sorry. Look, I'll go get the damn milk...""

Why is she being this way? Because she simply wants to deflate your success? No. She is challenging you because your success doesn't mean shit to her, unless you are free and loving. And if you are free and loving, nothing she says can collapse you. She wants to feel you are uncollapsable, so she pokes you in your weak spot.

Of course she knows how much this moment of success means to you. This is precisely why she is negating it. Not because she wants to hurt you. But because she wants to feel Shiva (the divine masculine: imperturbable, totally loving, fully present, and all-pervading). She wants to feel your strength. She wants to feel that your happiness is not dependent on her response, nor on you making a million dollars. She wants to feel you are a superior man.

It's a tall order to be this free, and in your more mediocre moments you will wish your woman would settle for less. But if you are a man who is living his fullest, willing to play his edge and grow through difficulties, then you will want her to test you. You may not like it. But you don't want her to settle for some bozo who depends on his woman's response to be happy. If you are aligned with your mission, you are essentially happy, even through times cycle between difficult and easy. You don't need your woman's strokes to fulfill your mission. It still feels good when she strokes you, but you don't need mommy anymore, telling you what a good boy you are. And your woman doesn't want you to need mommy. In fact, it sickens her.

If your woman is weak, she may settle for a weak man, and therefore play into your need to feel like a good boy. But if she is a good woman, a strong woman, she won't tolerate your childish needs for a pat on the head, collecting bigger toys, and being king of the mountain. A good woman will love the childlike part of you, but she wants your life to be guided by your deepest truths, not your untended childhood wounds. She wants to feel that at your core you have grown beyond the need for kudos and million-dollar toys. She wants to feel your self-generated strength of truth.

So she will test you. She might not be fully conscious of why she is doing it, but she will poke your weak spots, especially in moments of your superficial success, in order to feel your strength. If you collapse, you've flunked the test. You have let your woman deflate you. You have demonstrated your dependence on her for external validation. Even if you just made a million dollars, you are a weak man. Your woman cannot trust you fully.

If you remain full and strong, humorous and happy, your truth unperturbed by her testing, then you pass the test.

""Honey, I'll get you some milk, all right,"" you say as you sweep her off the ground and lay her on the couch, laughing, kissing, looking deeply into her eyes, and ""milking"" her happiness with the confident loving of your caresses.

**Christmas Eve** -- I went out alone (what? how?). I'm Jewish and I found out a few days before that there is something called a Matzo Ball where a good number of people show up at the bar / club and have a great time. So I went there alone with 0 expectations, but ended up having tons of fun. I approached a half dozen groups at least and made friends with everyone. I was talking to this girl for a while, but then walked away to get some water. When I came back, she was dancing with this guy and then made out with him.... I get into a bad frame of mind and actually leave the club to go home. I get 3 blocks away. Stop. Turn around and go back inside. I walk past the girl who was still dancing with the guy. I made eye contact with her, and I could tell something was off. Then I pulled the ballsiest move of my entire life. I walked over to the guy, tapped him on the shoulder, introduced myself and shook his hand. He just 'knew' ...and walked off. The girl tells me, ""You just saved me so much, you have no idea."" ...I never felt more confident in my life. We kissed. She lives 500 miles away so I never saw her again.

**New Years Eve** -- I really liked this girl a lot 2 years ago. Big crush on her. I did what every Forever Alone Guy does and after six months I told her how I really felt about her (by the way, unloading your feelings on her like this rarely, if ever works, and is described in the book in Step 1 as a self-sabotage technique). She responds verbatim, ""You'll get over it.""

Ouch.

Rarely speak to her, if at all, for 18 months. Fast forward to New Years Eve. She is there. I'm at a point in my life where I've never been more confident or socially intuitive, so I felt comfortable talking to her. We both acknowledge we're still single. We catch up a little bit and talk. The party goes on and every now and then we'd run into each other and talk some more. It was a good time. Then it comes time for the ball drop and we're just standing next to each other while everyone else has someone to kiss. When the ball drops, I just turn her around to face me, and we had an awesome kiss. We pause, look at each other, and then kiss again. We sat on the couch holding hands, leaning on each other and then we kissed again when I had to leave at the end of the night.

Again, I was just visiting NY, so nothing can happen as a result of this, but it felt great to overcome what was 2 years in the making.

**Patriots vs. Broncos Playoff Game --** Last night I went out alone (I try to make it a theme in many of my stories that going out alone is totally cool and you can still have a great night). So I show up at this bar and start talking to a bunch of the guys there. Real chill guys, we're laughing and bonding over football (it's a great way to get guy friends). The niners-saints game was awesome so everyone was talking about that. I got into a good frame of mind and was just enjoying myself and being social. A bunch of really pretty girls were there and somehow I managed to start conversations with them. I spoke to at least 3 pretty girls alone for 20 minutes each. I didn't get any numbers, but that wasn't my goal. I just wanted to be social and have a good time.

Night goes on, happy hour crowd files out, late night crowd arrives. I start a conversation with these three girls and one of them and I really hit it off. By this time in the night I was feeling extremely confident and talkative. Everything just felt very natural. I got her number, but it was getting late and I'd been there for 4+ hours. My leg was hurting and I just wanted to go home already so I told her I had to leave, but that I had to get a kiss first. She said no. So I said, ""why not?"" She responds, ""Cause you're being lame and leaving early!"" with a playful face. I can tell she didn't want me to leave. We kissed. I texted her when I got back and she wants to see me again! Who knows what'll happen!

So that's it! I hope these stories have inspired you to just **go out** and approach / meet people.

She's in the grad school, I'm in undergrad (3 year diff). Met a while back b/c she was giving me a ride somewhere, whole thing seemed pretty platonic until out of the blue she starts texting me a few months ago. Been a bit of texting back and forth, trying to make plans to take a walk or something, but we're both busy so it hasn't worked out yet.

A little while ago I'm at a huge thing on campus and she texts me to ask if I'm there, she says she's studying and I ask if she's studying alone and if she's free later. etcetcetc eventually i say my exams finish next week and we should hang out that night. she agrees and then keeps texting me questions for a bit about how the event was, so I know she's not just agreeing to end the convo.

Anyway, question (kinda) time:

1. I'm thinking suggest watching a dvd at her place and gauge her reaction to the suggestion and when i'm there to make sure we're on the same page in terms of wanting to hook up. **what to bring**, besides the dvd? stuff a couple of condoms into my wallet, sure, but otherwise? Like the title says, I'm a virgin
2. Thinking *Gladiator*, btw. Simple plot, long movie, fair amount of action and some shirtless fights so girls are into it. I feel like *Friends with Benefits* would be a bit obvious
3. Anything else to prepare? obviously trimmed my hanging chads but other than that?
4. Recently got braces (after meeting her; haven't seen her since) - she doesn't know. If that comes up how do you downplay that, as a guy in his very early 20s?
5. Same note - how do you mention the virgin part yet downplay it or (somehow) turn it into a plus?
6. If her apartment ends up being one where we're watching from a couch rather than her bed, how do you approach that? Remember, you're sitting on the couch with someone you've met once in a somewhat formal setting, made slight small talk with, and then texted a bit. You can't exactly plop down, put your arm around her and start the movie.
7. I'm in a dorm room, I'm assuming she's in an apartment a short cab ride away. Do I send ""Wanna watch a movie at your place tonight?"" or ""Wanna come over and watch a movie tonight?""
8. When do I send this? Day of? Evening of? Earlier? Instincts say evening of.

For both of these reasons, that avenue seems ineffective and restrictive to me, though my experience with trying this is minimal so far. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I've been a hermit my whole life. Where I currently work is a sausage fest, and I don't think I have enough in common with most of those people to make good friends with them and network to meet girls. (Besides, doing this is would be a mountain of a skill in and of itself. I meet people sometimes, but I don't maintain friendships.) My spare time activities are solitary.

I used to do online dating, with some success, but I got bored of it a while back. 

Only ideas I can come up with at this point are taking classes, and going to meetup groups. And I'm not sure this would even help me, because it's highly limited who I would meet there.

It's hard to come across anything I could use as a seed for finding out about anything I could get involved with where I meet people/girls, because I don't really have any focused interests.

There is something I would have to change about my lifestyle and most likely my personality, so that opportunities normal people seem to be surrounded by would even arise. I don't think it would be that hard to get girls if I had the opportunity. There is something I'm missing.

I'd like to hear what you guys have to say.

I'm 23. (Actually 30, but I go by 23 often, because that's how old I look. My personality makes me seem 18/19, which is what people guess once they get to know me a little bit. I couldn't pull off ""30"", nor do I desire to.)

I think there is two things I would need to change:

- Be absorbed in activities that lead me to meeting people (some of which would be girls).

- Have habits when meeting those people that allow me to further branch out socially into other activities where I meet people and meet girls.

I'm stuck as to what this would have to be. Every time I talk about this with anyone, I can't ever seem to get a straight answer.

I'd like to hear some insight from you guys, as to what I would have to do, or what concepts I am missing apparent from what I wrote.

I can speak ordinarily with people I know, like: family, friends and even co-workers.

But I seem to find myself moving around people because I'm trying to ""set up"" an area where and when I want to talk.

By ""set up""; I mean that I will find myself walking past a person or group of people because I'm anxious *or* I can't make my mind up on what to say. And then I will reach a restroom for no entire reason and just stand there and look to myself at a mirror -- And then I go out again and watch the person or group of people *and* again pass by them. I will never utter a word, I think I'm just trying to be cool by staying quiet. And when my tries at approaches are done I will seem like a crazy stalker and then I feel bummed out.

I feel bummed because I know I can be plain ordinary around people but I still find my anxiety and nervousness when trying to approach a person *or* a group of people and this is mostly strangers. I think about how I look like. And it's because on how I look; my face, my skin color-- People will judge. It's true, I don't have the charm in appearance but I don't want to lie to myself because I'm afraid of looking too foreign or maybe even too friendly. I don't want to seem socially unhinged. I want to remain reserved and calm like I always am and awlays want to be.

This makes me feel bummed because people advance and live to interact and grow with each other. I'm missing my chances everyday. So how do I go about opening up conversations with people? This is mostly because of a pottery class I have, people have seen how quite talented I am (not wanting to be brash). It's cool being silent and reserved while being able to sculpt pretty good amateur carvings but I also want to expand and talk to the people who have seen me do work and just.. Talk.

In the past weeks I've seen the activity on this subreddit pick up which is great! I've also seen a lot of guys having hard time reaching out to other people, finding friends and connecting with fellow human beings. Fret not, my comrades, the journey begins with a single step, and you have taken this step by coming here, continue on the path and we as a community will try to guide you along the way. I'm hoping that this post will help you understand others and to realize that there are many people in the same situation as you even if they don't have the flaws that you THINK you have and you THINK are debilitating to your social life.     
I had a phone conversation with a very, very good friend of mine the other day. As she was explaining what was troubling her, I realized that everything she was describing I've already seen many times before on this subreddit. Now, allow me to take a step back and tell you a little about my friend. She is a very gorgeous girl. A firery hot Russian read-head(seriously, she freaking looks like Scarlet Johanson from Avengers). Guys flock to her in droves and she literally can have any guy she wants. ""Good for her"" you might grumble bitterly ""she's one of *those* girls"", but no, not so. While yes, she is almost never without a boyfriend, they never stick around for long. They all seem to want her for her body, for her appearance, and nobody wants to connect with her and actually know her for who she is. And even many of her friends quickly disappear.  That leaves her feeling empty, lonely and damaged. She feels like that is all she is good for and that she will never truly connect with anyone, a feeling I'm sure many of those who have been foreveralones, me included, are familiar with.       
Now the thing is, she is not damaged, abnormal or weird(well, not weird in a bad way), just like everyone here isn't. Here is the actual email my friend send me, see if you can relate: 

""Hey ViciUniversum, just like you asked I am writing you back the suff I said
the other day.. Unfortunately i can't remember the exact way I said
everything but I will do my best. I hope it helps.

I remember I told you that sometimes I feel like i don't connect with
people and the other day, I was wondering why? Wondering if it was
just me, if I was the one inept.. Why I could sit in a room full of
other human beings and still feel like i could find nothing to say or
how to begin a conversation... I can't really relate to all the
trivial stuff.. the jokes which i don't understand.. the moments that
i try to but fall flat because no one picks up on my humor... I feel
not funnny and dumb.. But then I remembered about the few people I
have that I trully connect with, like my firends back home, like
you... laughing ridiculously and having plenty to talk about
regardless of how much time i spend with you... and I realized that it
wasn't me... I can connect with people and not just can, I long to...
it's just that others sometimes don't want to connect with me.. And it
makes me sad.. makes me feel so alone..  I know i don't allways trust
people, i have walls up... but that's cuz i am so used to being hurt,
by past friends, boyfirends, relationships.. things like that... And
most of all, i am so afraid that there is something wrong with me..
that once i show people who I am, that they won't like me.. that they
will be discusted and walk away.. I just want a group of friends I
feel close to.. people I trust, people i know i will want around me
for a long time, to build those strong bonds to pick me up when i
fall, and to pick them up when they need me too... I just want to feel
connected and to care about others, and have that returned.. to have
people who laugh at my jokes and make their own with me.. people who
suround me and make me feel funny and relaxed, those who i can have a
deep conversation with, or just bs about the latest moovie we saw...
But I just feel so... i don't know.. afraid... I wish I could just
talk to people... and not be so set appart... But here i am...

I hope this is close to what i said the other day and i hope that it helps. :)

Hugz, and thank you for being such and amaizing friend to me.""

This place was getting a little quiet. Wow, so successes...Yes! Definitely lots of successes in the past two weeks, but only through lots of risks and the will to try fresh new ideas, which I will be more than happy to share with you. First off- Halloween! There's something magical about Halloween isn't there? Shakedown had his big break on Halloween, and now so have I. I have a hypothesis(not a theory, use proper vocabulary! (&gt;.&lt;) ) that introverted people get a chance to really come out of their shell whenever they put on a mask or a costume. Let's face it, introverts wear a mask of ""normalcy"" throughout their lives, mostly because they fear that the person that they are will be judged, so when they get an opportunity to hide who they are through the anonymity of the Internet or an actual physical mask, their unique talents and personalities simply come out! I dressed up as [Ursul The Magical Dancing Unicorn.](http://imgur.com/a/BJNaM) For that night I WAS Ursul The Magical Dancing Unicorn! Now personally, I believe that my dancing skills are that of a one-legged orangutan during mating season continuously being zapped by a taser, but no! I danced in three different clubs and everywhere people complimented me on my dancing, even at the goth club!(seriously imagine a unicorn in a goth club!). They said I have ""skills"" and ""moves"", whatever that means(I don't speak your young-people hip-hop lingo). Hell, at one club they cleared the dance floor for me, so that I could do my super-awesome Gugnam-style! I was literally the only person dancing in the middle, while everyone cheered me on! Normally I would probably get embarrassed and retreat into a corner, but not Ursul The Magical Dancing Unicorn! He feeds off of public's attention and admiration! And that was probably the biggest game changer of the past 3 months(that's how long I've been doing the self-improvement). I realized that I AM Ursul The Magical Dancing Unicorn, and that people loved ME for doing what I was doing. Other than that I met a ton of people. Lots of people wanted to take pictures with me. Lots of girls danced with me. I got one number(cat girl's in the picture). A police officer asked to pet me for good luck and I think I met George Carlin's brother(in the picture). Overall- great night! I strongly encourage you guys to do this sort of thing. Dress up and be crazy! I'm actually contemplating doing this again, this time in DC(if Shakedown or ThoughtTrain are willing to escort me around(perhaps join me, hm?), as I have almost no visibility in that mask), just on a regular Friday night, just to encourage all of you(and meet people :P).     
Remember, I said ""first off"". Beside that I started picking up hobbies like crazy. You see, I joined [NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) and have been doing it on hard core mode for 72 days now. [There is just so much free time!](http://thatsglitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/theres-so-much-room-for-activities.jpg) So I've joined a parkour/freerunning gym. Picked up [Bikram Yoga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikram_yoga), which I strongly recommend for everybody! And, inspired by my dancing earlier, joined a break-dancing group at that parkour gym(seriously, that place is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious with a side of kick-ass!) and after only one class and literally learning only two break-dance moves, I bravely walked out onto the floor for the group jam session and did the best I could. And apparently I did pretty good, as they were fairly impressed. According to one of the guys, I'm ""naturally flowy"". Also this act was unprecedented. They had never had anyone muster the courage to dance for the group after just one class. Pat on the back for me, I guess. Minor side note: I asked a girl out at that gym. She wouldn't give me her number, but offered to take mine. She never called me, but whatever, it's cool, because...   
â¦I've been thinking of ways to ""speed number-close"". It's a challenge to see how fast you can get a girl's number. So far my best time is 10 seconds. This is a very simple move and that move is just smoooooooth-criminal, I can't believe I haven't though of it before. So let's say you're at a restaurant and you get a very cute server that catches your fancy. Whenever she says: âAnd is there anything else I can get for you?â you drop this line: âYeah, actually, I'll take your number!â and give her the best Hollywood smile you can do. Works wonderfully! In part because it takes them a second to process and when they do, they realize what happened and it breaks up the monotony their of work and it makes them smile. I used this line at Hooters yesterday and our waitress actually said âSure, I'll be right back!â and started walking away before she realized what I asked. She turned around with a huge smile and slight shock and accusingly said âYou!..â. I knew I was caught, so I jokingly stuck out my tongue and laughed. I didn't get her number, but I did make her smile and got to talk and joke with a couple of other waitresses there, and I think they might have remembered me. Plus it worked for me before, and I'm sure it will again :D. I give this to you as a gift. Go out there my pupils and use it! Let me know how it works for you!  
But wait! There's more! Yesterday me and my friend(Jeesus) went out for Veterans Day. Both of us being veterans(me- Iraq, him- Afghanistan), we went out in uniform. We bought four dozen roses and walked the streets of Richmond, handing out roses to all the women we saw. We called it âVeterans Day Roseâ event. It was spectacular! Most women simply lit up! Some didn't want them. One woman offended us. She accused us of trying to collect donations. Anyway our first run was so successful that we went and bought four more dozen and walked different streets of Richmond, closer to VCU. We ran into a group of sorority girls. Two dashingly handsome soldiers in uniform on Veterans Day handing out roses to sorority girls...Needless to say a new tradition was born. For those of you that a curious: nothing special happened, I exchanged numbers with a couple of girls, told them to call me and off we went onto another adventure, as we were running late for a previously planned engagement, which ultimately landed us at Hooters later that night. Which now that I think about it, to hell with those plans! We should have stuck around! Oh well, there's always next year. Or next week even!

J wanted to talk to her in the hallway, I didn't think much of it and began talking to other people. After a while I got curious what was taking this long. So I went to where they were. She was crying, he was soothing her. He asked me to leave them alone for a minute. At that point, I knew I fucked up something.

Went out for a smoke with this other guy and we talked a bit about it. I asked if he knew if she has a boyfriend, he said he thought she didn't.

After a while I went back and J told me that her and me should probably talk for a minute. It was visible that she cried for quite a while. She told me she had a boyfriend and that this was a mistake.
I felt bad for causing this, but she assured me it wasn't my fault.

We still hung around the rest of the night, but nothing more happened. After that she did give me her number, I don't know why exactly.

A few days later I still think about her and what happened.  I still think she's an awesome person and whish she was single. But it is tearing me up to some degree. I am a bit off with my mind all day.

In one way I am proud of myself to finally pull it off, but I'm also ashamed of making a girl cheat on her BF(although without my knowledge)

I've never considered myself an FA or even remotely close to one but this community is exactly what I needed to get my butt in gear and get out more. I need to learn how to talk to people I have never met before so I can meet new people and grow my social circle. I started today by scheduling a dermatologist appointment to discuss when to begin an Accutane regimen to (hopefully) cure my oily skin that has been a burden my entire life and is also one of my biggest insecurities. I also put a hold on some of the books shakedown_st recommends to learn how to attract women and just get talking to people.


At the end of this, I just want to say thank you again. I needed something to get me motivated and for some reason, this community did it. Thanks.

After a whole life of loneliness and almost losing any hope of getting a girlfriend, I met this girl. We work in the same place (I even managed to get her sit next to me). She's nice, we share a lot of common, geeky interests and best of all, she's currently single. I even had two lunchs alone with her (something curious happened when I asked her for a lunch but I'll tell you another time). I could say it's the best opportunity I'll ever have.

Now, to the negative aspects of this situation. I'm pretty shy, borderline to socially anxious. I don't know and don't have the guts to ask for a date. My best friend says I'm the most miserable, shitty, apathetic and negative person and he's right, a life of loneliness led me to a spiral of misery and bitterness.

Besides, she has achieved more things in her life than me. She also talked about her ex-boyfriends: one liked and had a lot of cars, the son of a high-rank military officer, a Finnish guy she wanted to get married to although I don't know if she was joking on this. Hell, sometimes I don't know when she's joking.

What I'm afraid is first, rejection and if she doesn't rejects me, that she'll find sooner or later the ""real"" me (or that I never had had a girlfriend). I don't know if being with her will be enough to make me more optimistic and empathetic.

[Dating for nice guys: Part 6](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/blackballon/journal/1552056309044839928/Dating-for-nice-guys:-Part-6)

May 5

**2 types of ""safe"" guys, and why logic doesnât work to attract women.**

I want to clarify that there are two types of safe guys. I think Iâve been focusing mostly on the more extreme types of safe guys in my examples, not just normal, well-adjusted guys who do not necessarily need to be in relationships to feel good about themselves, but who also donât have a high success rate of attracting women.

*Type 1: Extreme-Safe Nice Guys*

Guys who are like Ty in [Part 2](http://redd.it/tzgh9) of the posts - the type of guy who sinks into a puddle of depression if heâs not in a relationship, yet has no idea that the way heâs acting around them is probably actively repelling them. Heâs clueless. The type of guy who says, âall girls just want to date assholes.â I suspect your average run-of-the-mill guy does not fit into this category.

*Type 2: Regular-Safe Nice Guys*

Guys who feel okay being single most of the time, and like being in relationships if thereâs someone who piques their interest. They donât want to bang/date just anyone. The types of girls they like: a cute girl in class, a co-worker theyâve come to know a little bit, or someone theyâve met through mutual friends. They probably like girls who possess at least some inkling of intelligence, and are not really attracted to the shit-for-brains type. I know lots of guys like this, and they come in every variety. Most of them are really intelligent and successful in their careers, but canât recreate that same success with women. Your average regular-safe guy has probably had either none, or a small number of girlfriends in the past, but is far more likely to get friend-zoned. I feel like these are the guys who might benefit most from the advice Iâm giving. Youâre not clueless, but you do need MORE of a clue in how to be viewed as a romantic interest with the girls you want to pursue.

In addition to the other stuff Iâve written that you can do to try to accomplish this, I want to talk about why so many safe guys with different upbringings and life experiences think alike. Itâs not like you all grew up in the same small village in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere where you all drank from the same well and knew the same people. Knowing why you think alike might help you to better understand your own behavior and give you an idea of why what youâve been doing in the past hasnât been working.

I said this in a previous post: âI donât know why guys think that if they show tons and tons of interest, the girl is going to be like âWow, heâs so into me! This makes me really want him too!â I guess itâs logical, but unfortunately it doesnât work that way.â Since then, Iâve thought more about this. It really lies in the logic part. If youâre a naturally logical person (which many people are, and especially engineers or similar), then what youâve been doing to attract women actually makes perfect sense. Pretty much everything else in life works well when you think about it in that way, right?

Examples:

1) Youâre trying to get a promotion at work. You put in tons of effort, work late, do extra tasks, go above and beyond. If your boss values your work ethic and and appreciates what youâre doing, youâll probably eventually get rewarded with a raise or a nice year-end bonus or something. You work hard so you get rewarded. Makes sense.

2) Youâre trying to get a good grade in your class. You go to all the classes, see your professors in office hours, do extra research, form a group to study with, write draft after draft so you can write the best paper possible. You get an A in the class. Very understandable.

3) You wait tables at a restaurant. You take orders quickly, remember special requests, fill water glasses before theyâre empty, and you have a positive attitude towards your customers. At the end of each shift, you make a lot more than your fellow co-worker with the pissy attitude who largely ignores his or her tables. It doesnât surprise anyone that you get better tips. It makes perfect sense. Itâsâ¦ logical.

Okay, so then letâs try this.

4) You meet a girl at a party your friend is having. Sheâs pretty and smart, you have a conversation, and you really want to get to know her better. Itâs all very casual, and you guys say something about adding each other on Facebook. The next day, you add her and write her a message saying how nice it was to meet her. She responds after a day or two and says it was nice to meet you too. Youâre very encouraged by this and think thatâs a good sign. You send her another message. She takes longer to respond, like say 3 days or something. You respond immediately. She doesnât respond. Maybe she didnât see it? You send her another one, jokingly asking if sheâs still alive. No reply. What happened here? You got too predictable, easy, safe, whatever you want to call it.

Logically, it makes sense. You like a girl, put in your best efforts, make it known to her that youâre very interested, and you SHOULD get that promotion/A grade/big tip/her. Sorry folks, doesnât work that way. Less is more. Keep that mystery happening. Iâm not going to rehash everything Iâve written in the other posts or it'll just get really repetitive, but just realize that what feels right to you naturally is probably working against you with women.

**What you shouldn't do if she breaks up with you.**

*Quick vocab lesson if you didnât read the [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/txjxz/safe_guys_vs_unsafe_guys_dating_for_nice_guys) about nice guys:*

*""Safe"" - Predictable, caring, very nice guys who you know will drop everything to be with you, eager to please, very sweet. The type of guy you'd want to have a family with - good father, dependable, doesn't cheat, etc. The type of guy who often ends up in the friend zone.*

*""Unsafe"". It's about being your own person. Not being needy, being independent, being self-assured, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you. Someone who doesn't need a lot of validation from others and has an ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude.*

Iâve been thinking about what I wrote yesterday about nice guys and dating, and one thing I'd really like to emphasize is that learning how to be âunsafeâ is not only beneficial for you to get girls, but also for your own sake. Itâs very healthy to be your own person and not let someone have too much power over you. It will help you in the long run too, if a relationship doesnât work out.

An example: I have this friend on Facebook, whoâs more like a friend of a friend, and Iâve only ever chatted with him once. Letâs call him Ty. At the time of our conversation, Ty had never been in a relationship before. He was the embodiment of a âsafeâ guy. Fast forward 6 months or so, and heâs met a girl. Sheâs substantially more attractive than he is, and is the type of girl who likes to post photos of herself posing in midriff tops and bikinis. Every other day or so, Ty would update his status saying how much he loves this girl, how this is the happiest heâs ever been, and how waking up to her beautiful face was the best part of his day. Iâm thinking, âShit, this is not going to end well if they break up.â

The relationship lasts for about a year. She breaks up with him. How do I know? Because now every day there is a new status update about how he canât stop thinking about her, that she was the best thing that ever happened to him, and that the only way to stop thinking about her is to drink. Even an update about how he knows that heâs being a pussy but he doesnât care. All these posts are public to the world, which means she can read them. This goes on for months, and includes a status update saying that the girl already has another boyfriend. I feel sorry for Ty. I can tell heâs a good person with many friends who care about him because people are posting on his wall, trying to give him advice, and offering to talk to him on the phone if he needs it.

If I knew this guy better, this is what I would have told him: If you want any kind of chance of getting this girl back, you really need to stop with the status updates. The neediness. Take a step back. Chill. This girl had way too much power over him and she knew it. She probably didnât want it, and it could have killed the attraction. Of course, I donât know the whole story and Iâm speculating, but Iâm going on what I know about girls in general. Girls I know donât like it when a guy is so into her that he gives up a part of himself and would completely lose it if she broke up with him. Itâs like a guy cutting off his own balls and handing them to the girl. The relationship becomes incredibly mundane, predictable, and itâs just like, âDo you really have that little autonomy that everything you do, and your overall happiness, is dependent on me?â

That is not healthy, and totally goes against the characteristics of being an unsafe guy (again: being your own person, not being needy, being independent, being self-assured, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you). If Ty exhibited some unsafe characteristics, the relationship might have stood a chance, and even if it didnât, he would have had an easier time getting over it because he would have had a firmer grip/more power over his own life.

If you feel like a girl youâre dating is pulling away, you can do one of two things: Try to convince her to stay, call/text/email her all the time, tell her how much you love her and canât live without her, and hope she understands how you feel and will take you back. If sheâs already lost her attraction to you, this will only drive her further away. If she hasnât, it probably will. Itâs just too much. Itâs giving her power that she doesnât want. Itâs annoying her and sheâs probably texting her girlfriends saying things like âhe wonât leave me alone.â The next thing you know, sheâs moved on.

The second thing you can do is to take a step back. Respect her space, and donât smother her. Take it easy. You might be thinking about her all day, but keep it to yourself. Tell her she can call you if she wants to talk. In the meantime, reassess. What went wrong in the relationship? Sometimes people are just incompatible, and thatâs okay. Maybe you didnât do anything wrong. Maybe sheâs just ready to move on to another chapter in her life, one that doesnât include you. It could be a million reasons, but at this point in time, itâs not really in your control. If you suspect early on that sheâs losing interest, itâs possible that you became too safe and she started losing her attraction to you. So what can you do?

You give her space, tell her to think about it and to call you when sheâs ready and then YOU ACTUALLY DO JUST THAT. Leave her alone. If she calls and youâre busy, let it go to voicemail and call her back later. Live your life. Donât drop everything for her. Two things can result: a) Your independence and âunsafenessâ re-attracts her and you guys reconnect, or b) sheâs over the relationship by this time already and leaves/never calls you. If she wants to be with you, she will find a way to contact you.

If she leaves, you know you handled it like an adult and not like a needy stalker. Youâll feel better about yourself later on, and she will respect you for it. Then in the next relationship, you work on yourself, work at developing more unsafe characteristics into your personality, and if that relationship doesnât work out, you know what? Youâll be okay, because you are your own god damn person who does not need to give all your power to a girl to feel good about yourself. Continue until you find someone you want to be with forever (if thatâs your end goal). It doesnât have to end like Tyâs story each time.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_tzgh9,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/tzgh9/what_you_shouldnt_do_if_she_breaks_up_with_you/,

They suck.,meh_mediocre,11,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/txhxj/setbacks_they_suck/,"Well, it's been a week since I started hanging out here and reading through the shakedown material to help determine where I'm at and where to start. Last week felt good; I was pretty positive, sociable, and tried to make strides to be more approachable. I'm working on exercising more (I already golf daily, running 2 miles a day as well), and I'm gonna try picking up some audiobooks to listen to during my commute.

I got the opportunity to meet up with some friends this weekend to head over to Miami to check out a leg of the [Volvo World Race](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVUWSMXcXL4). It was a lot of fun and I got to meet a girl, but I decided not to go beyond being friendly and enjoying the event. It was a good confidence builder, without making me move too far out of my comfort zone.

My little brother also came back from college this weekend, and his girlfriend is coming in tonight. So my whole family was together on Sunday, which kind of turned into a mess for me. I did really well for the longest time shrugging off the inquiries of ""When are you going to start dating like your brother?"" but eventually I just got sick of it. The last straw was when my mother decided to announce that I must have intimacy issues because I don't hug people and have very stringent personal space requirements. I'm not happy about it, but for whatever reason that one made me shut down entirely. I got the hell out of there and back to my apartment as soon as possible. I knew I had fucked up by letting it get to me, I didn't handle it well, and now I was feeling emo-rific again. I had a couple of drinks and called it an early night.

I'm feeling okay about it today, but I'm a little upset that I broke so quickly. I knew that I needed to just let it slide and I didn't. I'll probably be back on track by the end of the day but it's frustrating to see me go back to being that depressed so quickly.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_txhxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/txhxj/setbacks_they_suck/,

The topic was neediness and pursuing people who simply are not interested in me. Below is his response, some information is redacted per Reddit's rules. Hopefully his advice will be useful to some other people, as it is for me. 
---


I had a similar issues in college.  Perhaps a little like you, I was somewhat self-absorbed, and more in touch with my needs and wants the needs and wants and insecurities and process of other people (including females).

In wanting to prove myself, I was preoccupied with pursuing those women who ""weren't that into me"" and more or less taking for granted women who seemed to like me.

Then a teammate gave me some advice I never forgot:  ""Dan, some women are going to like you no matter what and others aren't going to like you no matter.  Why waste time on women who aren't interested?""  

So here's your assignment:  In the next two weeks, ask at least three women out for coffee or lunch or whatever.  If they put you off or don't really seem interested, then scratch them off your list. 

You're familiar with the saying that ""You have to kiss some frogs before you find your prince/ss.""  

Your letter reminds me of that saying, ""The lesson is simple, but the student is complicated.""  Keep it simple. Spending social time with someone you like is not that difficult.  Stop over-thinking this 'daunting' task of (in your words) ""creating positive friendships with females.""  Or hoping ""for validation through dating."" 

Women have some differences from men (other than anatomical), but basically we all want to be understood, loved, and appreciated.  So if you like / are attracted to / someone, ask them out to eat, or for a walk.  Be straightforward.  ""I'd like to spend some time with you â get to know you better.""    It's not an equation, but natural human relations.  

Keep in mind that just as you aren't interested in every woman (for some, the chemistry just isn't there) â some women won't be interested in you.  No big deal.  Move on until you both click.

And one more thing:  An old girl friend reminded me, ""Some people are interesting . . . and some are interested.""  Be interested.  Listen as much as you talk.   Most young women enjoy meeting a nice guy who likes them and whom they like, admire, and are comfortable with.  The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed they will be. Keep it light â you can actually have some laughs.

It's not a hunt, strategy, or game. I have no special tips, tricks, or secrets.  (But you might read Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."")  

You write about your life as if it is one big self-improvement project, with problem-solving and tasks to be accomplished.  How about just living?   (By the way, if you haven't read The Life You Were Born to Live, you might take a look at that as well.  Understanding your life path can be quite helpful.)

Now go out there and be bold!  And in the process, have some fun!

I followed done of the steps here but I managed to have an amazing date last saturday just out of the blue. So here's the full story.

A few years ago I liked this girl I met through some friends, she was funny and we would talk for hours. Being the young love struck boy I was, I didn't realize that she was a complete drama queen who didn't give a damn about me, and that did come back to bite. Eventually I figured it out and was furious, but it'd be a year and a move across the works for me to admit it to her. I stopped talking to her and after a while and forgot about her and that was that.

Fast forward a year and a move back into the same town, and at a mutual friends birthday we met again. She was still her drama queen self, but she'd mellowed out and I'd gotten to the point where I didn't mistake attention for affection. We talked about what happened the previous year, and went our separate ways under good terms.

Last week, she messaged me on skype asking where I was going to college and after I answered we ended up video chatting. At the same time her friend was in the room and the previous drama queen decided to play matchmaker. After my previous experience with her I wasn't too sure about it, but I decided to play along for the hell of it because her friend was very cute and very well spoken.

Her friend and I texted each other over the week and last saturday we *really* hit it off. It was a pretty surreal experience going on my first date ever with this really nice girl and we decided to go on a second date sometime next week or so.

tl; dr - Don't burn bridges unless the person is of absolutely no value, and even then do so only sparingly.

To catch you up: Was a bitter FA for the better part of 28 years, had anxiety and depression problems, finally decided to do something about it. Got on medication and into therapy, made a real effort to date. That was several months ago.

I've found that I'm feeling much better. Things generally don't bother me like they used to and I'm much more open with people than I've ever been in my life. I've even been on a few dates and kissed some girls (got a little farther than that with one girl, but wouldn't really call it sex).

I still have to fight my brain occasionally to keep from slipping back into depression, but I'm way better than I was and can see a way out of being alone now.

I have only been dating online though, mostly due to not caring for the bar scene and generally having no idea how to find a date in real life. Kinda reaching the limit of where I can go with that, and when I posted my profile for review I found out that my taste in clothing is, apparently, quite off putting. This made me start to slip into my old thought patterns for a while, but I'm telling myself it doesn't mean I'm a failure, just that I have something I can work on.

So keep it up guys, strive to better yourselves and you can get out of the FA pit.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_s013w,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/s013w/my_update/,

Unfortunately it wasn't until literally just now that I discovered this much more conducive-to-success subreddit.

[Well, I did it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/pb2bg/cover_me_im_going_in/) This morning, while sitting in class waiting for it to start, I asked the cute girl I've been sitting next to for the last few weeks if she'd like to go on a date with me. Her answer, without hesitation: ""Sure!"" She has family obligations the next two weekends, but we're on for the Saturday after that.

I know there will be skeptics who will just point at the part about her having ""family obligations"" as just being an excuse to get out of itâI sure as heck would be one of them. But, one of them she told me about before I even asked; and after class, I asked again to make sure that we were making plans for the third Saturday from now, and she again said yes without hesitation. The paranoid, cynical FA in me still says ""oh, that's plenty of time for her to change her mind and back out,"" but if she's still willingly sitting next to me in class and cool with making awkward small talk after almost a month of this, there's at least a better chance than usual that her reply was genuine. Time will, of course tell.

Advice for any fellow FAs who want to ask a girl *(edit: or guy; don't wanna be discriminatory)* out: **DO. IT.** Grow some har on your bls and do it. A word of warning, though: it **WILL** be *the most nerve-wracking thing you will ever do.* I slept horribly last night, largely likely due to the prospect I knew I was facing this morning; the event itself happened at about 10:15; I was a nervous wreck in all of my afternoon classes; and almost 12 hours later, I still have a bit of an adrenaline rush left over from it. But, just suck it up and get it over with. Some of the best advice in the comments on my original post were to not wait around, that waiting longer leads to a higher chance of friend-zoning, and that's absolutely true. Again, time will tell what ends up happening in this story, but I will be sure to update again as things progressâI owe it to y'all; without your encouragement, I wouldn't have been able to get myself to do it.

It seems like a basic, necessary function used in every day life, but to be able to talk to complete strangers is easier said than done. Find a book on conversation and talking to people. I read this one: [How To Talk to Anyone](http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Anyone-Success-Relationships/dp/007141858X).

Dale Carnegie's classic, ""How to Win Friends and Influence Enemies"" is also highly recommended. In either case, it's crucial to read one of these. Even though I was FA, I still felt I was a decent conversationalist, but you'd be surprised how you can pick up a few good tidbits that can make a difference.

For example, instead of saying ""What work do you do?"", say, ""How do you spend most of your time?"" ...Because, what if they're unemployed? Conversation over? Always give the person you're talking to a way out.

Someone says, ""Where are you from?"" ...Do you respond with just a location and that's it? A lot of people do, and the conversation can be boring and laborious. Say some interesting fact about your home town, ""Long Island, home of Billy Joel and 7-11s"" ...or ""Long Island, but I had to leave that place because there were 10 guys for every girl."" ...All depending on context and situation.

Do not be a stubborn, know-it-all. Assume you know nothing and start fresh. Rid yourself of the bad habits and begin with a clean slate. Pick up one of these books and read it. Become a more confident conversationalist.

I have lurked around here reading for a while. I thought everyone seemed awesome, and I enjoyed reading about the positive outcomes of peoples relationship problems.

I do have to admit though, I often just considered myself lucky and never really got involved with any commenting or up/down voting, since I was in a happy relationships, I didnt feel the need to help others. Selfish, I know. 

Well that awesome girl I was with, turned out to be not so awesome, she cheated on me, and I was a wreck. 

I eventually got over it in my own way (Exercising, Getting out to do things I enjoy, stayed sober, hung out with every pretty girl I knew just as friends to make me calm around women again, etc.)

Then I came back to reddit and realized, this stuff is priceless. People really need help. The masses providing it is incredible. 

This is not the end though. I decided that I wanted to be a part of the solution too. So I started a site called breakupvote.com. The site allows a place to get anonymous break up advice, has some break up quotes, and is still growing in features etc.

I have to say since founding the site, I have helped a girl that was in a semi-violent relationship make a great decision, a girl in a terrible cheating situation got out of it, and the others I have not been directly involved with myself, all seem to be getting awesome advice.

So I just want to say thank you for motivating me to get to this point, I truly feel because of this subreddit, reddit as a whole, and a terrible chick, that I was motivated to make a great decision in founding my own site. I have made a difference in two lives in one month already.

It's a game where your goal is to get rejected at least once a day for 30 days. The idea is to build up your confidence and overcome your fear of rejection. [The rules are here.](http://rejectiontherapy.com/rules/)

They sell a couple of packs of cards for $15 each or $10 for downloadable ones. That sounds ridiculously steep to me for only 30 cards. There's iPhone apps with the card in them for $3 each, but still, that sounds steep for only 30 suggestions. (Hey, I'm extremely frugal.)

Anyway, I managed to find the original deck in a hidden corner of the Internet, and while some of the suggestions are good (e.g. ""Before buying something, ask for a discount,"" ""Offer to help a stranger with their groceries,"" or, ""Ask a stranger for change for a dollar.""), some are just downright bad (e.g. ""Smile at every person you walk past today,"" ""Ask someone their politcal affiliation""). I mean, how do you get rejected by smiling?

Point is, you don't need the cards to do this, and we are amazing, CREATIVE people who can come up with some damn good Rejection Suggestions. Let's have at it.

I try to chime in during group conversations but I'm often not heard or what I have to say comes off as not interesting so no one notices. Despite trying to be as confident as possible, afterwards I feel like I'm just being awkward. It makes me very self conscious.

Often I am asked to repeat myself because I either said something too quietly, slurred my speech, stumbled over my words or sometimes answered completely off topic. 

I really don't want to be the person who gets ignored. I want to be heard without having to constantly think about being heard. I want to have something interesting to add.

It's hard to learn to accept myself when I'm constantly reminded by people that I can barely hold a conversation. I need another point of view, someone who may have been in the same situation as me or who knows what I'm going through. 

Part of it, I think, is that I'm concentrating too much on trying to say things in a confident way (in order to come off as a confident person), that I end up messing up my words and thoughts. If I don't try to be confident, I become the silent listener. 

I really need some help. Everyone around me so easily engages in conversation with each other and I feel like such an outsider. I don't feel engaged in the conversation like they are. Instead of thinking about what they're talking about I think about why they're talking.

I practiced not giving a fuck for about a year, and while this has helped me get on with other things in my life, it's also left me really numb towards that aspect of life.

Now, suddenly, I am in the prime position to shed my 'FA' status, and even more shockingly, with a girl that I find quite attractive. Last Friday, I was chatting with my friend, let's call her Darlene. We became good friends last year. This year Darlene is living in an on-campus house with another girl, let's call her Agatha. 

Now Agatha was always someone that I had admired from afar, but due to my crippling shyness, never approached. We had some classes together last year, and had the occasional chat, but nothing more.

As Darlene and I are talking, Agatha joins us. I try to keep a cool head, and we all chat. Eventually the talk turns to Friday night plans, and somehow we agree to all hang out later.

Later, I met Agatha at a mutual friends house, and we were all drinking and making merry. We all eventually head to this party, but the cops bust it an hour in. She and I sit and chat outside for a while, and we eventually go back to her house. We watched a movie and I wound up sleeping on their couch. 

I had previously made plans for the morrow, so I left in the morning. Agatha made us coffee and we talked for a bit, then I left (with a hug). Stupidly, though, I completely space and don't ask her for her number. 

The weekend passes, and the school week drops like a sledgehammer. I am wondering about the whole thing throughout Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.

On Wednesday I get out of class, and my phone buzzes. It's Agatha, and she is wondering whether I can hang out for 420. Hmm. I wind up going over there, and we hang out for SIX HOURS. We get high and laugh at random videos, then we decide to watch a movie. 

During the movie I am trying to touch her, not overly so, but in a comfortable way (we're on the couch.) Halfway through she extends her leg and crosses it. Over. Mine. 

The movie ends and we just stay like that for a while. 

Then she asks if I'll give her a back rub. 

Within minutes she is laying on me. I am holding her in my arms on the couch, massaging her. It is the best ever. 

I know I am supposed to kiss her. After years of struggling with that fact, with the stagnation of gender roles over the course of human life, I finally know that I have to. She has been great about showing her physical interest, but I know I have to do this.

But I don't.

It ends fine, with me saying with regret that I had to go do homework. We hug and during the hug I try to pull her close, but something inside me frays, and I mumble something about hanging out on Friday. Then I leave.

That's the story. Does anyone have a piece of advice or encouragement for me?

EDIT: This is what happened. I posted this and went to class. After class I read these comments, which were insightful as shit. Seriously. They actually agitated me into a state of mild frenzy. With need to release this energy I decided to walk to a nearby friend's house and relax there. Everyone there was gaming and chilling. My friend sensed my unease, and eventually I let slip some details of my situation, dancing around specifics. He reinforced the idea that I couldn't just receive her physical energy without sending some her way in return. Then another person there, casually eavesdropping, dropped this bombshell: 'Think of the most ludicrous action you could take that applies to your situation, then you should probably do that thing.' That's roughly paraphrased. But all of a sudden I was walking to her house. While walking I texted to her to see if she was even there. She was, and that I should drop by. When I got there, Darlene was outside talking on her phone. I went in, and around and knocked on her door. She was sitting knitting. She seemed surprised, but pleasantly so. I went in and sat down in an empty chair facing her. I had some idea of a sentence but it came out garbled. The driving idea behind everything was that I was stupid for not kissing her. What I said was 'So I was being stupid the other night.' She looked at me and said, 'No, you weren't.' It was all happening and I just looked at her for a bit. Then I think I said 'Goddammit.' Then I was moving close to her, and I said something like, 'I'm sorry but I think I......kiss you.' I can't remember it but I know I said the word 'kiss.' Then I was kissing her. It was............I think she liked it. I don't know what I was doing. We switched sides one time. I broke away and said something like 'Um.' I can't recall what she said, but then I said something like 'Er, that must have been weird.' Darlene came in. We all talked about stuff. Agatha revealed that after I left the previous night, she ate a whole tray of Rice Krispie Treats and she laughed a lot when she said it. It was leaving time then and she walked me out, and we hugged for a while, a really great one. I started talking really fast about dumb things, but it didn't matter. Eventually I left and tomorrow's Friday. Holy fucking shit.

EDIT 2: Can officially state that my 'FA' days are behind me. I now feel confident and able to replicate the actions that I took with Agatha, towards any girl. Good luck, y'all.

Since then, I have been trying to put myself out there, act confident and have been working on becoming a better me. I finally got a date (yay), which led to a second and eventually a third which was tonight. 

All was going quite smoothly, until we had some post-making-out honesty, where we talked about our sexual history and I told him that I was a virgin. This surprised him and I don't think in a good way. He said ""I was not expecting that"" and ""you speak about sex much more casually than other virgins I know"". Also, I mean I am almost 23. 

I tried to explain, telling him that I struggled with having body confidence and that I lack trust in other peoples motivation towards me. I was seriously just digging a hole for myself. We left the evening not terribly: he walked me home with a goodnight kiss and he said ""he had fun"". He acted like a gentleman however I get the overwhelming feeling I won't be hearing from him again. 

My questions are these: could I have handled this situation better/differently? Were my rationalizations just insecurity talking, or was it the right thing to be upfront about the 'why i'm still a virgin' thing? Also, IF I get a call from this guy: do I keep going out with him even though he's uncomfortable with the status of my hymen? I feel like such an awkward penguin.

**How to figure out if the friend you like actually likes you back**

You know that girl you like? The one you see at work/have the same class with but youâre just friends? You want it to be more, but youâre unsure about how she feels about you, and you donât want to wreck a good friendship if it turns out sheâs not into you. Hereâs a tip for finding out without making things weird between you two.

**Give two options and be casual when asking her out.** Her choices will give you a clearer answer.

*An example of one option:*

You: âKate, the new James Bond movie is coming out this weekend. Want to go see it with me?â

Her: âUmm, I have a lot of work to do this weekend, sorry.â

[Awkward]

**or**

*An example of two options:*

You: âKate, the new James Bond movie is coming out this weekend. We could either go together or ask Sarah, Tim and Alex to join us. What do you think?â (Note: Say this as casually as you can muster.)

Her: âI have a lot of work to do this weekend but yeah, you should definitely ask everyone else. I think Tim really wanted to see that movie.â

[Not interested, but less awkward]

Obviously Kate really could have a lot of work to do that weekend, but if you keep doing this a few times, and she ALWAYS has work, or school, or something else going on, itâs pretty clear that she doesnât really want to do anything with just you. You guys can stay friends without directly having the weird âare we just friends or something moreâ talk.

*Another example, if you guys donât have mutual friends:*

You: âKate, the new James Bond movie is coming out this weekend. We could either go together or get some people we know to all see it together. What do you think?â

Her: âYeah sounds good, Iâll ask my friend Jan is she wants to come.â

[Not interested, but less awkward]

If she's interested, the conversation would probably look more like this:

You: âKate, the new James Bond movie is coming out this weekend. We could either go together or get some people we know to all see it together. What do you think?â

Her: âYeah, letâs just go together.â

Ah, so the next question is, âif she wants to go with just me, does that mean sheâs into me?â No, not necessarily. Itâs hard to tell from just one incident. Keep trying the same thing in different scenarios and see if itâs consistent. If sheâs always responding that she always wants to just do stuff with you alone, itâs promising.

If you've been reading all this and think ""holy fucking crap, that is incredibly complicated and convoluted and if you just want to ask a girl if she wants to be more than just friends why can't you just ASK and be okay if he/she says no?"" It's not all about you. It's about the other person too. You are saving THEM awkwardness too, even if you don't get why. Once you get used to doing this, it's effortless. It works beautifully. I do it whenever I need to ask someone something where I'm very unsure that the response will be. It's usually with people I don't know very well. Truthfully, I didn't even know WHAT exactly I was doing until recently, when I consciously thought about it and pegged it as ""two options"". If it comes out naturally the other person will have no idea, and even if they do realize, there is no harm done because it's not manipulative or malicious.

Good luck!

1329176430.0,6,self.faimprovement,po7k0,Let's do this.,PinguWithAnM,11,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/po7k0/lets_do_this/,"Hi Reddit,



Tonight, I just wanted to confide. I've just rushed back home from the pub, where I found an ordinary social get-together with some of my best friends unbearable. Why? Because I kept thinking that I was a worthless schmuck with absolutely nothing interesting to say, and that my presence was dragging down everyone else's enjoyment of the evening. I sat there, politely laughing at all of my friends' comments, had a single drink, then came back. The whole time, I hated myself so much. I couldn't bear to be myself. The girl I really like was there with us and I didn't even say a word to her. But I guess I know that this isn't really about girls or wanting to be accepted by my friends or whatever; it's about me and how I feel about myself.



This had been happening for a very long time; much longer than anyone else realises. Once upon a time, I was fairly happy with myself and a lot of people liked me. I'm not sure what happened since then, but at present, I'm a sad, lonely, negative person, who doesn't like himself. Was it the case that I'd never really been happy, but was merely pretending? It doesn't matter. My original intention here was to list every single sob story of my life, mope around for a couple hours, then go to bed. But fuck no. I'm fucking tired of feeling shit when I know I can be so much happier. I'm tired of being this guy, because really, I know I'm not, deep inside.



Thank God (I'm not religious, just a figure of speech) that I found this subreddit. I was going through all the usual Forever Alone stuff, and I stumbled across this place. At first, I thought it was going to be the usual back-patting and wound-licking that I've resorted myself to far too many times whenever I've been down and depressed. I realise that it's the complete opposite now. We're all here not because we hate ourselves, but because we care about ourselves and want to learn to love and respect ourselves.



From this moment on, I'm going to improve myself. I want to enjoy my life. It's not that I haven't tried to improve myself before, but I've never had the guts to stick with it. I'm sick of giving up, ""starting on a fresh page"" every once in a while, and hoping for my life to get magically better. Tonight, I'm going to bed only thinking about the positive things in my life. I have a seriously great group of friends, whom I will start trusting more. I love my family, despite how much I like to think that my familial relations are dysfunctional. I am fairly intelligent, and I will do well at university, now that I will try harder. Despite my general moping, I am not that bad-looking, and have already started going to the gym on a regular basis. I know I'm not that funny, but with practise, I know I can make people laugh with me, not at me. There isn't any solid reason in my life for me to feel crap about.



Tomorrow, dear Reddit, I'm waking up at 6am to go to the gym. Then I'm going to go to my lecture. After that, I will meet up with one of my best friends (whom I saw earlier tonight) to tell him about my situation, my desire for self-improvement, and ask for his support. Then I'm going to do my student radio show, with another good friend of mine. When my schedule is over, I will still be a single guy on Valentine's Day, but I won't care. I'm going to meet up with my friends, get trashed, and have a good time!



I don't care if no one reads this all the way through; I don't expect anyone to. I'm sorry that a lot of this might be incoherent to anyone but me. But this is meant to be my oath to myself. I will not fail. To everyone else who wants their life to get better - I'm going to do this, and I want everyone to succeed as well. Good luck to all of us.



Tl;dr - I feel shit and have been feeling that way for quite some time. I'm going to work to get better. Let's do this.



Happy Valentine's Day for tomorrow,



PinguWithAnM.

I read [The Game](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Penetrating-Secret-Society-Artists/dp/0060554738). A lot of redditors in [/r/foreveralone](/r/foreveralone) dislike the book, saying it teaches you how to manipulate women. This could not be further from the truth. It teaches you how to not come across as a total creep when approaching new people. When you approach someone, you want them to feel comfortable being around you so that they will continue to talk to you. If you nail that down, then you have made enormous progress. Besides, it's a great read. I credit the book for helping me get my first legitimate date ever where I walked up to two random girls on the street and got a date out of it.

The book provides a lot of great ideas on how to approach groups of people. I took the general idea and came up with one that was not in the book that, so far, has 100% success rate in opening up a group (tried 10+ times with it so far).

Go up to a group of people and say, ""Excuse me, can I get an opinion on something real quick? My friends and I are having a debate and it's a matter of life and death."" 

...The group will agree to hear your matter.

""Okay, real quick, because I have to get back to my friends, but if your tube of toothpaste is running low, do you squeeze the bottle or do you roll it up?""

This seems dumb, but it's a great conversation starter. That's all you need to do...Start a conversation and make people feel comfortable to be around you. That's the essence of The Game.

Hmm, yeah. So having spent the umpteenth weekend all alone now, I am slowly going insane, haha.

So, I just wanted to ask, how do people make friends?! :S
I have always had a very small number of friends, and they've usually been pretty good friends. I guess you could say I've always been picky about them. But people are moving around (especially myself) a lot, and I am for lots of short periods in areas I don't know many people, if any at all. And I don't know what to do about it.

I am not too angsty about social events anymore, I've done a lot of work there. I even know I can do pretty well if I manage to get into it. But I still know how painfully bad I am at conversing. I just can't ever think of anything to say, the conversation falls dead and we usually don't talk much again.

I should probably join some sort of activity, but I don't know how to find some, or even something I think I would enjoy.
I also often realize how draining I find socialising. I am sooo tired after work every single day that the last think I want is to go somewhere I would have to talk to people :/
I am working an internship right now, so I just go home, make dinner, work out, then bake or surf around reddit/do other hobbies.

I'd also like to say that I've learned quite a bit this past year. I met a guy once who had seen me a few times. He was very interested in people, and he said that he didn't understand me. I was always alone, working or out running. We were drunk so I just told him that it's because I'm not any good with people, but I'm trying to improve. We then talked for quite some time, but what he said was that it was weird talking to me. That it was like I had no mask, no persona I put on, and wearing my insecurity on the outside. And that this makes most people uncomfortable. It is hard to connect with anyone when they feel uncomfortable talking to you. I am not sure what to do about it. It is all I have ever known, but I suspect a bunch of practice might better it, I don't know.

I am 24 now and since I was a freshman in highschool, (so about 13 or 14) I've wanted a girlfriend, VERY badly. When I was younger, it was just something that came up in my mind fairly frequently but didn't really interfere with my life. For the past few years though, getting a girlfriend is the ONLY thing I think about. It's not like I don't try to talk to women. I try all the time, and I fail all the time. There was one semester at my college where every time I had a break from classes, I would go to the cafeteria and when I saw a girl sitting by herself I would just go say hi, ask them how they were, how classes were going etc. And nothing. A few times I got a girl's number, but it seems like it was just because they didn't want to say no, because when I texted them I never got a reply.

I don't do this consciously, it just kind of happens and it's really not good for my self-esteem since I honestly cannot tell if I have legitimate concerns or if I'm being paranoid.

So yeah... help? I'm going to be living on res at uni in a bit over a month, and I really want a fresh start; ones that's not tainted with this excessive self-pity and over thinking.

I'm wondering if that's a normal and unavoidable part of being human, or if my need is intensified by things I'm able to change.

I don't always feel lonely or have a strong desire and craving to socialize. However, even when I don't crave it or expect something good from it beforehand, *successful* socializing has a major positive impact on my mental state. I can change from being depressed and stuck in my head to a far more healthy and normal-seeming mental state.

Basically, it's like a drug. If I compare the mental state improvement from the best drug experiences by myself at home with with effects from successful socializing without drugs, they're very similar.

Reducing the intensity of this need would be a good thing. I'm not saying I want to not care about being social so I can stay FA. The intensity actually makes socializing harder and contributes to keeping me FA. Feeling bad from not socializing makes it hard to start socializing, and craving socializing makes it even harder.

I wonder what strategies I can use to reduce this need. I expect that knowing how to [make myself feel good](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/15zkr3/creating_happiness_by_myself/) would help, but I don't know much about that and don't know how far it can take me.

I guess there is also a way to extend the benefits of socializing to when I'm alone. For example it seems that working on goals which matter to other people I care about seems to create a sense of connectedness even when I'm alone.

Although I havenât achieved the results I want yet, I have a much brighter outlook on life and am generally in a better mood than I used to be.  I now understand that this is a life-long transformation and it can take months or years to reverse old thought patterns and habits.  But one thing I noticed during this process is that my scumbag brain actively âtriesâ to prevent me from improving.

Yesterday, instead of staying in my hotel room (on a business trip) all night mindlessly browsing Reddit and Facebook, I took a walk outside, exercised in the gym for about an hour (cardio and lifting), started reading a book Iâve been putting off, went to a bar alone, and tried to initiate a conversation with the attractive bartender.  At the end of the day I felt great about changing up my typical nightly routine â¦ but today after work I didnât feel like doing any of that. My brain told me âyou should just sit on Reddit and Facebook all night like usualâ.  I didnât listen to my scumbag brain â I exercised for an hour and went out to a bar again.  It feels much better breaking out of the typical nightly routine.

My point is that it took me 24 years to realize it, but the struggle REALLY is internal.  To quote a song from Rocky, âitâs you against youâ.  This train of thought is actually amazingly true.  My theory is that evolution is the cause of routines and repetitive negative thought patterns, and it takes a strong willpower to change all that. Of course we can save that debate for a different subreddit. Thanks to Shakedown_St for all the resources youâve created, theyâve really helped to change my outlook on life for the better.  May we all have a brighter 2013 to look forward to and continue the improvement process!

I've been working on many changes for 15 days (that is, since the day I read it) and even tough I still have a long way to go, I'm definitely improving.

There's one thing from the book which is confusing me though. Quoting the book:

&gt; Breaking Free Activity #4

&gt; I've taken surveys in several No More Mr. Nice Guy! groups asking the members about the 

&gt; attachments they use to try to get external approval. The following are just a few of the responses. 

&gt; Look over the list. Note any of the ways in which you seek approval. Add to the list any behaviors 

&gt; that are uniquely you. Write down examples of each. Ask others for feedback about the ways in 

&gt; which they see you seeking approval. 

&gt; G     Having one's hair just right. 

&gt; G     Being smart. 

&gt; G     Having a pleasant, non-threatening voice. 

&gt; G     Looking unselfish. 

&gt; G     Being different from other men. 

&gt; G     Staying sober. 

&gt; G     Being in good shape. 

&gt; G     Being a great dancer. 

&gt; G     Being a good lover. 

&gt; G     Never getting angry. 

&gt; G     Making other people happy. 

&gt; G     Being a good worker. 

&gt; G     Having a clean car. 

&gt; G     Dressing well. 

&gt; G     Being nice. 

&gt; G     Respecting women. 

&gt; G     Never offending anyone. 

&gt; G     Looking like a good father.

While some activities from the list are clearly pure approval-seeking, there are some, such as ""Dressing well"", ""Being in good shape"", etc. which I don't completely understand. For instance, the main reason I dress well is because it helps me accomplish my own interests, particularly by being more attractive to other people, which should help me to meet friends and women. But this can be seen in some way as approval-seeking, i.e. I'm dressing well because I want people to think of me as an attractive, approachable person.

What do you think about it? Is there something wrong with my mindset?

It's no problem, save for the times I want to go out to have fun. It's fun drinking alone, too, but on a friday/saturday night, that's just sad.

 I usually just go to a bar and draw people, and if a nice-looking company of people walk in, I casually try to join them, though it's kind of exhausting trying not to make people uncomfortable by reminding them you aren't actually with any of them. Also always being the odd man out and knowing that once they decide to head off somewhere else, you'll just be stuck there alone again. That's a bad feel.

Another problem with going out alone are the men. I don't know how many times I've had to leave a place and head home just because some guy starts following me around. You wouldn't guess what a few beers does to a man's capacity of understanding the word ""no"" on the first try.

 Also, getting drunk alone is also unsafe for obvious reasons.

The thing is, I do *have* friends, but half my friends don't drink and the other half won't drink with me.

outside of the texting, and this could be completely unrelated because of work situations, but she's seemes a little less 'exited' (i guess you could say that) idk maybe I'm over thinking it, but it seems that she's less interested ever since I've asked for her phone number. but I know for a fact that she's told other people about it, because I've been congratulated by one of her co-workers on the accomplishment. lol

So far, I've only read is No More Mr. Nice Guy (the first one on the list) and am currently reading The Game. I came in skeptical that No More Mr. Nice Guy was going to be a manual on how to become a d-bag, a notion that the author disabuses the reader of in the first chapter. Essentially, the opposite of crazy is still crazy. It really goings in to how social awkwardness and anxiety develops and why putting other people's needs ahead of your own can be counter-productive to meeting your own needs and meeting the needs of the object of your kindness. It also spends a lot time explaining how to be direct and honest about what you want out of your relationships. It has already changed my life so much for the better.

One thing that I do find lacking from the list is books on male fashion and dressing well. I was talking to a couple of my friend's the other day and they mentioned that knowing how to dress well would help me set positive first impressions (something I've always struggled with). It would also have the side benefits of providing me with an interesting topic of conversation that both men and women could find interesting and helpful, allowing me to be a more valuable friend and more attractive person. 

Towards that end, I've been looking for good books on male fashion. Let me know if you guys know of any. I've already ordered Details Men's Style Manual: The Ultimate Guide for Making Your Clothes Work for You by Daniel Peres and Esquire The Handbook of Style: A Man's Guide to Looking Good. I'll update when I finish reading them with my thoughts on them and if they seem to be helping me in life.

Since I'm in engineering school, my only shot at meeting women so far has been through online dating, or at bars.  

Online, I've been able to meet about 6 girls through various site (okCupid, match, eharmony.) The girls I like, I can never build the courage to actually make a move because its pretty much a blind date (I don't know if they actually want to be there or not.) The girls that actually show they like me don't usually speak English very well. I'm pretty sure I've messaged every girl in my city, so I've given online dating a break.

So I went to this bar yesterday with a few friends. We go inside, and its more or less a club, with a bar to the left and a dance floor to the right. Plenty of girls walk in taking up the dance floor and the bar. My friend tells me to dance with some girls on the dance floor. I dance like Carlton for the fresh prince of bel air...and not in a cute way. Since I've tried ""dancing"" with girls before, and it doesn't work out.... I pass.  

My friends approach to meeting women at the bar is to say ""Hey how's it going?"" right as they turn a corner or open a door. Women don't like this. They are usually shocked and then just ignore him. I never had the heart to tell him that its kinda creepy, and it kind of lowers my confidence seeing him get shot down.

My approach is to try and make eye contact with a girl and smile. You can usually gauge if a persons into you that way. Problem is, I end up doing a bashful head thing whenever a girl reciprocates (not very manly.) So I notice this girl at the bar check me out a few times. Thing is she's surrounded by people, and it's fairly loud inside. How the heck do people meet in bars when its that packed? After a few beers we just decided to leave.  

What are some good baby steps I could do to getting dates without online dating site?

This was my original post:

I've been trying.
I really have. I have no idea how many people I have been talking to for the past week. Early this year I concluded my FAness needs heavy work to be broken. So I applied for an exchange program to Japan and got in! Great!

So I'm in the first week and have been hanging out with the other exchange students here, it's the only ones here yet. Going to every single event and gotten into some groups. And I realize that all my old friends are more or less my friends because we are mostly equally awkward, weird and poorly socially equipped. Or maybe equally depressed. I don't know. Or are we?

I meet all these people and they are so full of life, of joy. Joy I don't think I've ever really felt. I can't relate to it, so I've retracted away from these kinds of people through my years. I never understood them. I've never been outspoken, I've never been the one running around fixing stuff. I never bothered running to get in line for something, because everyone gets their turn. Though sometimes I didn't, and I would get a little sad. Not everyone gets their turn. I hope I know that now.

The people here are from 5 years older to 3 years younger, but I feel inferior. Or like I'm not cut out to be with them. I don't know these people, I have no clue how they work, how they function. What fules them. They all feel so extroverted compared to me. I'll have a good conversation from time to time, but they are often cut shorter than I'd like, filled with looong moments of silent awkwardness after.

And it has finally made me realize that, yes, I think I'm depressed. And that just makes me sad. For I must then have been depressed since birth. Or maybe not. I don't know.

Update: spent today with a bunch of people that are more like me. I had loads of fun and felt it went great. Can I not handle super social people?

I used to think I was hideous due to cultural reasons (moved around a bit). Recently I found out I'm not. I used to not leave my house because I thought I was ugly and no man had ever looked at me (because I was unapproachable), but since I started smiling more and dressing better men have taken more and more interest. I realized I wasn't ugly before. People treat me a lot differently, some people are meaner, others are way nicer. I'm really good at one-on-one conversations with girls (well I have my good and bad days) but have never had a normal kiss or held hands with a boy or been asked out or anything. Never had an emotional connection with a guy or been in a relationship (obviously).

According to the OKCupid mirror thing, I am a 9.8/10, although I don't know how accurate that is. I created a profile where I put the town I lived in but it's so small and isolated that nobody was on there. So I changed my location to the city I'll be visiting this summer and got a hundred and fifty messages in a few days. Then I worked up the courage to try a local FB dating application and again, guys way out of my league started tagging me with positive comments and I met a guy on there. I got a bunch of messages, some were just normal conversations while others where overly sexual. It just felt so overwhelming and I felt gross doing it. But something strikes me as odd about the guy I had the easiest time talking to, he called me by name in every message and sent me several messages a day when I didn't respond. He seems overly forward, aggressive even but he hides it with a ton of smileys. I don't even know if we have anything in common so he's most likely just messaging me because of what I look like. The others I just felt overwhelmed messaging and sometimes inadequate, etc.. I go back and forth between feeling like the most hideous creature on earth to feeling really good about myself. When I start feeling bad about myself I feel ashamed of myself for having ever liked my looks. Plus I never really thought I'd ever get used by guys considering how I used to see myself but now I'm so paranoid about that.

Now I feel good about myself most of the time and like the other day, a guy smiled at me directly and straight in the eyes after I gave a speech at a volunteering event where I casually mentioned having had a difficult time socializing as a teenager, saying that was why I was passionate about it. He had never looked at me before when we met, he always avoided me. During the speech I had laughed and was kind of nervous but joked about being nervous. So it's like I was connecting with the audience, but I can never do that with guys or normal groups. In groups I smile awkwardly and am silent. But he smiled so genuinely at me, everybody did, and it was like the guy was about to say something but even though I had a crush on him I just panicked and smiled slightly and walked past him super quickly. This happens all the time. I'm so inexperienced so that makes me nervous too. I never know what the fuck I'm doing. When I start to connect with people, now that I think about it no matter who they are, and I can see they're warming up to me, it's like I just have an internal meltdown.

A few of the people I have known as acquaintances for a while, but last night they felt like friends. I even got unsolicited Facebook invites from a few of them, something that *never* happens to me.

* **Exercise works wonders.** - I'm doing the prescribed daily cardio and every other day strength building. While I'm doing it, I listen to whatever book I'm currently on, and practice the tips I'm learning about socializing while I work out. *By the end of the workout session, I'm often grinning without any reason, presumably because of the endorphins released.*

* **Don't Rush Step Two.** - The books [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/Friends-Influence-People-Dale-Carnegie/dp/0091947464/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335641752&amp;sr=1-1) ([audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002V5BV96&amp;qid=1335641775&amp;sr=1-1)) and [How to Talk to Anyone](http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Anyone-Success-Relationships/dp/007141858X), are *amazing*. They are already changing the way I think about people and improving the way people treat me, and it's only been *three days*. However, these books are packed with information, and they're not books to rush through. I recommend reading them simultaneously. Read How to Win Friends straight through, as it's a great overview and changes the way you think about people. How to Talk to Anyone however, is a list of 99 tips, and trust me, you want to take your time and practice each tip for as long as it takes to master it. *Practice 4 or 5 tips at a time before continuing on.*

* **Get your life together.** - As someone who lives alone, often I let my apartment fall into a disastrous state. I also work from home, so there were often days that I'd go all day without showering and wearing yesterday's clothes. Hopefully you don't have this problem, but if you do, fix it immediately. *Get ready each morning as if you might have to run out for a date at any minute.* That way if you realize you need to run to the store or someone invites you out for lunch at the last minute, you can easily drop everything and go. Having a clean living space encourages you to be productive on improving yourself, and opens up the possibility of inviting people over to hangout whenever you feel like it.

* **Smile at everyone. And make eye contact. Constantly. No exceptions.** - This alone is a drastic game changer. When you make a conscious effort to smile at everyone you interact with, and look them in the eye, you come off more friendly and inviting, and you end up feeling better about yourself because you're meeting people's gazes. *You'll immediately start to feel less alone, because people are looking back at you, noticing you, and generally smiling back at you.*",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_sx5qu,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/sx5qu/week_one_recap/,
1331484729.0,8,self.faimprovement,qrmzg,Went to a meetup last night. Very interesting and good night.,shakedown_st,9,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/qrmzg/went_to_a_meetup_last_night_very_interesting_and/,"So now that I've been doing this for a few months, I feel like I've read enough material. The only way I'm going to get better now is if I just make approach after approach after approach. 

My main problem is getting in that ""frame of mind""...That zone. I've gone out alone the last couple of nights and I just couldn't get in the zone. But I do know, that when I'm in that zone, I feel unstoppable, invincible, and can make *anything* happen. I figure, there must be other guys out there like me looking to have wingmen and help each other out.

I went on meetup.com yesterday and sure enough, found a group that does this exact thing. People like me, who are new to the game and self improvement. These meetups apparently have coaches who go and ""advertise"" themselves and help those that show up approach women and so on, you know the deal.

So I show up, and there were a few coaches there. They each specialize in various aspects of ""the game"". One coach specializes in ""day game"" ...Meeting women in the day time, malls, cafes, food courts, super markets, that kind of stuff. Another coach specializes in ""same-day-lays"". I was more interested in the day-game coach because I'm looking for a serious relationship. The other guy was just slay and move on. Not for me. There even was a female coach there who apparently coaches men. She does it by approaching a group of girls, complementing them on what they're wearing, etc..It's easy for girls  to do that and start a conversation. Then she will say, ""Oh, have you met my friend so and so. He's super cool."" and then the guy is in. My problem with this is, that it's a total crutch. How is the guy supposed to get over approach anxiety if girls are just handed to him? It doesn't help him in the long run because he can't have a girl introduce him every time. 

So I stuck with the day-game coach, who was a short, older, balding, Jewish guy. You would never even think he was a dating coach or pick up artist, but he knows his shit. He specializes in body language, and..as you know from this subreddit, I am HUGE on body language so the two of us hit it off on that. We also found out we had a mutual friend in common, so that was cool too.

Anyway, the night goes on and there was a set of 3 girls and one guy. The coach tells me that it's not a great set to approach, but I should just go for it anyway. I was definitely in the zone and had a nice energy about me. I felt great and when I'm in the zone, I have little or 0 approach anxiety. I open with my toothpaste opener and get everyone involved. After a little while, I realize that one of the girls and I in the group knew each other from a while back which let me tell a funny story. I had everyone laughing and I was doing great. In the corner of my eye I saw the coach and one of the other students watching my interaction.

It went great and I ended up giving my contact details to one of the girls I was interested. I screwed up because I should have gotten her contact details, but I was nervous to get back to the guys. We'll see if anything happens there, but I doubt it. The coach told me I did a great job.

So that was that. I'll see what comes of this meetup group. I'm wary because if you get a coach, it could run you up into the hundreds of dollars. I just can't drop that kind of cash right now, but I know I can learn a lot from these guys who have been doing it for years.

I highly recommend checking out if there's a local group near you. PM me if you have any questions.

It lasted about a semester. I don't date a lot and it was hard to end the relationship, but it was for the best because she did not have her priorities straight.

A problem, though, is that we ended up getting so close that all of our friends were mutual and we hung out in one bit group, but they were her friends first and now they spend all of their time with her since we went our separate ways and I don't know them extremely well.

But. Now what? I've legitimately just stopped giving a fuck about relationships. I want to be able to date casually, but I just don't click with the majority of girls, even if it's just a date. I'm not self-pitying anymore, fuck that. I know I'm not a terrible looking guy, I know I have decent qualities, but I'm not pursuing relationships for a while.

I'm also an introvert. I can communicate with people with no problem, but for the most part, I live a relatively closed-off life and oftentimes just can't put myself out there. I'll also be commuting to college next semester, which will pull me further off the grid. I don't really have a consistent group of friends since high school ended and we all went our separate ways.

1365722338.0,4,self.faimprovement,1c63po,Re-thinking the 'Friend Zone': Why you should consider a quality platonic female friendship.,FArehab,9,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1c63po/rethinking_the_friend_zone_why_you_should/,"In the spirit of this subreddit, I thought I'd share something that helped me move past forever alone. This is for those among you who have enough social abilities to attract opportunities of friendship with the opposite sex but can't quite get that ever-elusive relationship. I know that's not everyone, but I think this will hit a sweet spot for quite a few. Obviously I'm not an expert on this and if you think it's bullshit then you only wasted a couple minutes of your life. I figure that it's worth writing this if it possibly helps even one person.

Just to give a little background on myself. I always had a couple good friends growing up but never had any success with the ladies. Although I had recognized my lacking social abilities some time before, I didn't start to consciously improve my social skills until Junior year of high school. By the time I started college, I was comfortable with meeting new people, socializing in more settings and holding good conversation. Making and strengthening friendships became a lot easier. Still, I had no success with the fairer sex to speak of. However, towards the end of college, at age 21, I finally entered my first relationship and had my first everything. Now, two years later: I've seen two relationships come ago, had some more casual experiences, have increased my dating skills significantly and have a bright outlook on the future. This wasn't because of luck, *platonic female friends are almost entirely to thank for my escape from forever alone*.

Now, it's typically hard to accept that some some girls don't want to be more than friends. When you have been longing for a relationship for so long it's easy to fall for any girl who you become closer to. Unfortunately, you may find out that she's not interesting in anything more, *she just likes you as a friend*. This is the dreaded 'Friend Zone' which you might be all too familiar with. Forever alone or not, *lack of mutual feelings sucks for everyone but there's generally little or nothing you can do to change someone's mind*.

This, however, is where I found an interesting opportunity. What if we were just friends? What value can such a friendship hold? Well, in retrospect, I'm certainly happy that I decided to find out. The following summarizes key benefits that I found with my best female friend as well as others who followed. All of this will generally be more effective with girls who aren't ""one of the guys"".

**You'll get much more comfortable around women.** This is something that I certainly struggled with before. Not quite social anxiety, but the number of times I was reduced to silence or one word answers is huge. Having a close female friend who you have many positive interactions with will help with other women, it's that simple.

**You will get a lot better at social interactions with women.** Generally, men and women are fairly different social beings and we'll never really ""get each other"" entirely (see AskMen/Women). Now I know there are exceptions, but I'm going to make some generalizations because it applies in the significant majority of cases. Interacting with women is not the same as talking to you dude buddies, this is not a case of one-size-fits-all. *You need a different approach with women, socially.* This is not something that someone can easily teach you since it will certainly vary by personality. It really comes through experience which a platonic female friend is more than capable of providing. You'll start to realize how you should direct conversation, what you should talk about and how best to express yourself. 

**You learn a lot about boundaries.** There are certain things you can say or do that will never help you in any context. These are things that you might have the hardest time recognizing but that a female friend could identify instantly. If you ask for honest feedback on these things then you'll likely receive it. Then there's the topic of friendly teasing. The pick up artists like to call it ""negging"" but this is simply something people naturally do when they get more comfortable around each other regardless of gender. You wouldn't make the same jokes between strangers as you do between friends. Obviously, this strange comfort that we find in playfully teasing each other also plays a key role in success with dating and relationships. Again, teasing girls is not the same a teasing guys. And, yet again, this is something that you can come to better understand through experience with a female friend.

**You get useful advice and feedback.** On your sense of fashion, your personality, your quirks, etc. You'll hear the good, the bad and the ugly. *You'll have a better sense of how you are perceived by women and why*. This is really a goldmine for self-improvement.

**Wing-women are valuable.** Even fairly inexperienced wing-women can be more helpful than moderately experienced wing-man. Women bring a certain level of comfort to each other. It makes you instantly seem less creepy and more desirable. I haven't had the experience yet, but I can only image what a skilled wing-woman could do.

Well there you have it, my thoughts on the potential of platonic friendship with women. I don't think the 'Friend Zone' needs to be this terrible place. It's simply a fact of life and, I think, it provides a good path out of forever alone.

Today I moved back into my dorm, and I just had a panic attack. I don't want this second semester of my Freshman year to end up like the last one. I'm afraid to even unpack, I just put some of my clothes away and now I'm sitting here typing this. I hear people out in the halls going out to the co-op to buy their books, meeting each other for dinner, etc. It fucking sucks. Over break I told myself that this semester I would be confident, I would try to talk to as many people as possible and get back to and be even better than I was before.

Moving in the fall of last year was fucking awesome. I met up with the guys I met during orientation, made a lot of new friends, went out and did fun stuff together, and generally had a good time for the first month or so. I had a (what I now see as) unhealthy relationship with a girl from back home that we were trying to work out long distance, and as things between her and I got worse (lessening communication, me putting in too much effort, insecurities on both our parts, etc.), this started to affect my social life.

Halfway through last semester, I went to go visit this girl and she dumped me that weekend because I had became way too clingy, insecure, and emotionally attached in the long distance relationship, and we had an emotionally draining breakup that left me depressed with no self-respect. Her and I used to be awesome and flirty and had a lot of great memories, and I made the horrible mistake of basing all my happiness in her rather than in myself, and I'm still recovering from that. Now she's joining a sorority, in tons of clubs, and I can't help comparing myself to her. The saddest part of all is that she KNOWS how pathetic I am, I feel like the only reason she wants to be ""friends"" with me is because she feels guilty for dumping me the way she did. She even offered that I should room with one of her friends next year who goes to my school because I don't have a roommate selected, which is a nice offer and I appreciate it, but it makes me so insecure in an area of my life that I never was before. Going into college I never expected it to end up this way. I used to always be confident in myself with whoever, and all of a sudden I found myself staying alone on the weekends, crying. I stopped hanging out with everyone besides my roommate, and I eat half my meals alone. I try to reach out to the old guys I hung out with at the start of last semester, but they live across campus and whenever I do I never feel wanted, and I KNOW that it's just this new insecurity that I've developed from my shitty break-up, but I can't help it and it hinders me from really reaching out to people and being myself. The only people I feel truly comfortable with are the guys from back home, and while it's awesome that I have a tight nit group of friends when I go back to my hometown, I want the same sort of thing here. I hate feeling pathetic.

I feel like I've missed a huge opportunity in my life to branch out in college, in joining clubs, making deep friendships, and going out and just making memories and having a good time. I'm super afraid that this semester is going to end up like the last one, with me feeling alone and pathetic. I can't handle going through that again. It numbs me, inhibits my intellectual and creative growth, and makes me an uninteresting nobody.

What do you guys think?


""Work on who you are, before working on whom you want. Discard ""meeting someone"" as a purpose. The world is filled with people, and you will inevitably meet someone at some point anyway. Be kind, but don't tolerate being used. Be helpful, but be so for its own value rather than getting something in return. Understand that you being single doesn't reflect on your value, you are whom you are no matter if you're alone or not. Smile. Appreciate what you have, rather than long for what you don't have. Listen. Especially to other people. Try not to guide them or instruct them, but to understand them. Joke a lot, laughter is in many cases the key to a womans heart, and in all cases the key to your own. Be modest, for you are not the pinnacle of creation, nor is anyone else. Be proud, for you are not the lowest form of life, nor is anyone else. Hate no one. Express yourself. You might do so through a poem, or a painting, or music, or dancing. Expressing ones self artistically is like reaching down into a bag of unknown content, only looking to find something, but not knowing what it might be. Have no judgement on what you find, but present it to the world. Be honest with others, even if they are not honest with you. Know that sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long, and in the end... It's only with yourself.""


""So, instead of having the goal of ""finding the right person for me to marry and have kids with"" which you don't have complete control over (even though it is more than likely a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"") if you set a goal such as ""living the fullest life I can possibly live"" or ""living peacefully and contentedly, filling my world with love and life"" you are setting a goal that can be reached without the help of anyone else, so it truly is an attainable goal. Furthermore, a goal such as this one will be the healthiest and most promising effective step towards the fulfillment of the former goal (meeting the right person to marry and have children with).

Another thing that I am hearing is that your happiness is riding solely on another person. The only thing I would caution here is that no human being deserves the burden of carrying another person's happiness; not you, not him, nobody. No one can take that kind of pressure, and if this is the case (in the long-run; there will be times when he carries you and when you carry him) the relationship you've searched for so fervently will deteriorate and collapse out of resentment: he will resent the burden of your happiness, and you will resent him for not being able to carry it. So I would strongly encourage you to find your happiness somewhere more stable, where you can draw from it and provide it to another person. If he claims to be able and willing to be your sole source of happiness, I would actually watch out -- this guy might be controlling and posessive.""",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_151cgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/151cgi/words_of_advice/,

A few times in the past year(ish) we have made out while drunk and the first two times we wouldn't even speak of it the next day (or at all - I didn't even have her number). 

Anyways, the last time this happened was a few weeks ago and afterwards I decided to man the fuck up and get her number and talk to her. When I first texted her she said that she had a fun time the night we made out and we have been texting back and forth since that time (around 2-3 weeks) but unfortunately I just found this sub and realized I have been falling into some of the mistakes that FAs fall into. 

I have been dominating the conversations and usually texting her more than she is texting me (although it is around even). She always texts back and usually she does so pretty quickly (which makes me think she might be interested) but I am beginning to realize that I may be coming off as needy or pursuing her too much. She seems to not initiate any conversations, but merely respond when I initiate.

I haven't texted her in a few days and I'm kind of waiting for her to make the next contact but I'm wondering if this is the right thing to do. Also, do you think I have already come across as being too needy and turned her off to me or is there still a chance to salvage anything?

As the title says, I am completely lost. A little background. I'm 16, male, and I live in Kansas City, Missorui. The same town I was born in, but not the same place. My hobbies are writing, singing, and martial arts. I know that I am an excellent writer, and when I write creativity flows through me. I also know that I am an excellent singer, however, not through personal preference - other people tend to tell me I am an amazing singer, and I tend to disagree. I have come to terms with this being the Dunning-Kruger effect, however. I have practiced and studied 7 different forms of martial arts for several years, and am in excellent condition (or, as excellent a condition a 120 pound skinny and nerdy kid can be.) i personally spend much of my time studying quantum physics, astrology, nerdy stuff like that (obviously only the theory, the Mathmatics of it are beyond me.) I was placed in the talented and gifted program in seventh grade, and have since taken various IQ tests, which I generally score mid 140s- to mid 150s. I consider myself a very unawkward, though very shy person. In general, I'm about as normal as you can get considering the context, I suppose. But I have a huge problem with self esteem.

I do in fact know the roots of my self-esteem problems. Ever since I was 6, I have not lived in the same house for more than a year and a half. I have gone to 14 different schools in my lifetime, and changed high schools 3 different times in my sophomore year (I am now a junior.) because of this, I never had any chance to make any sort of friends anywhere- maybe some short lasting friendships, but never something long and meaningful. At the age of 12 my mother married a man who had three children of his own. The oldest one was abusive and would repeatedly hit me and call me ugly. I found out a year ago he sexually molestead the other two children. Luckily that never happened to me, but because of it i have had some self esteem issues when looking in the mirror. I have since only realized (about 3 months ago) that by most peoples standards I am actually quite handsome? I still can never tell myself, but a lot of people recently have made some comments that have made me realize I am not the ugly monster I once thought myself as. So, basically, I have always been a social recluse and always considered myself ugly and untalented, to an extent. I have never really had any friends, and have been chronically depressed (for years) until recently. This is obviously not my whole life's story, but the gist of why I need help. My whole life has honestly been a lot more complex than this, and because of my experiences and intelligence I believe that I am a lot more mature for my age and also, to an extent, world weary. I am still quite depressed, but recent events have brought to light I am not as pathetic as I oncethoguht I was, I am actually quite talented,  and there is potential for a lot of doors to be open to me. However, the thing that I really long for - is love. I have never had a girlfriend. Hell, I barley ever even speak to people - and all the time I fantasize that maybe I can get together with a girl; maybe I can drown my past sorrows in love. Its hard for me to accurately describe, and I don't feel like I am getting the picture across, but essentially I am still mildly depressed,and in my heart there is a great passion and desire for someone that I do not know and if I did would have no idea how to talk to. I feel completely alone, and I am not certain if I am painting an accurate picture or not, but also completely lost. 

Is there any advice any of you can give, from helping deal with my depression to tips on talking to people in general, dating advice, etc?
Thank you, if you can. 

I apologize for any grammatical and formatting errors, but I am on my phone, sad, and it is 1 am. I might revise and edit things later, and I will probably change the post around to make it feel smoother, but I'm not up for it at the moment.

1351424238.0,6,self.faimprovement,127rvs,"So, I apparently should submit this here. Sick of being FA, and want to get better? Here's my suggestion.",DerbyWidow,9,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/127rvs/so_i_apparently_should_submit_this_here_sick_of/,"It's a long one. I know. Suck it up, and read it all.

Firstly, I'm talking about this from a male, neckbearded, geek perspective. But this does not **just** apply to us. It applies to everyone. XX or XY. 

Here's the TL;DR: Roller Derby. 

I'm not implying that Roller Derby is a place to meet piles of hot girls (which, admittedly, it _IS_, but that's not the point - most of them will probably already be taken). The point is to find a way to actually be able to communicate with people of the opposite sex like a reasonably coherent human being. 

Roller Derby is springing up pretty much everywhere. The odds are that you will have a group in your area - no matter where it is. Google something like '[your location] roller derby'. There'll be anything from a small facebook group, to several massive leagues. 

Found some? Sweet. Go watch some Roller Derby on youtube.  It's fun to watch, and is an interesting game.

So now you know a bit about Roller Derby. Rock up to your closest league and say something like 'I've watched some roller derby on YouTube, and I think it's great. I want to help. What can I do?'

By saying those magic words, you'll suddenly become best friends with a pile of girls who will habitually skate around in front of you wearing fishnet stockings and hot pants. They always want help. There's never enough people.

Of course, I'm exaggerating slightly. You will actually have to do 'stuff', but all the 'stuff' you do is fun. If you don't want to skate, you won't have to skate. There's an entire group of Roller Derby called NSOs - Non Skating Officials. These are the ones that manage the penalties, run around inside the track, organise bouts and run the scoreboard (and geeks - this is where I'm looking at you. We can do this stuff with our eyes closed. It's easy. But it's black magic to a group of girls who are competent in Excel and Access at work, but wouldn't know a .jar if it stabbed them in the eye).

So rock up. Keep rocking up. Help out. Be useful. Feel free to be shy. Don't pretend to be someone you aren't.  But, after a couple of months, suddenly you're on first name terms with 20 or so new female friends. Some of them may be single. Almost ALL of them know someone who's single too. 

However, the girls that skate? The other NSO's? The ones you're helping out? They're out of bounds. Treat them as untouchables. You are PERMANENTLY in the Friend Zone with them. Don't try to get out of it. But this is the point. Here are a pile of girls that you're on first name terms with, who will run up to you when they see you out shopping and hug you. Who will go out with you at the after party, cry on your shoulder, and vomit on your shoes. 

That. Is. The. Trick. 

At some point in the not too distant future, you're going to realise that you're at a bar, with a bunch of girls wearing fishnet stockings and hot pants, and all the other girls in the bar are going to be looking at YOU.   'What has this guy got going for him?' they'll be asking themselves. 'All these other girls seem totally happy to be around him'. 

And you're going to be SO USED to talking to 'hot' girls in a social setting, that it's not going to be difficult for you to go up to the girl who's checking you out and say 'Hi. I'm xyz. These are my girls. What's your name?'

OK. It's not that easy. I'm lying a bit. But that's the idea. You need to be comfortable talking to women. They're not some magical creature that you look up to.  They're people. 

And after you've been there for a while, everyone will know you're single. And some of the girls may offer to hook you up with their friend who's single.  Note that girls ARE GOOD AT THIS STUFF. They may misfire the first few times, but that's just them zeroing in their targets, and adjusting their aim.

Hey, you're their pet geek now, right?  (Or, if you're not a geek, you're their pet DJ. Or their always-there penalty tracker. Or just someone they can rely on to turn up and help out) They want to keep you happy.  You run their scoreboard. Or DJ their bout. Or video it. Or run their website. Or run around doing any of a million other things that we find easy, that baffles other people.

Or, maybe, you're a chick. And you've read this post, and watched some Roller Derby on YT and gone 'wow, that DOES look like fun. I get to beat other chicks up? And then go out drinking with them? AWESOME!'. Rock up. Ask to join Fresh Meat. If you're not interested in Skating, you can NSO too. There's always room for one more. And your friendship circle will immediately expand. You have a bunch of sisters that love you, will cry on your shoulder, and let you cry on theirs.

(Re-reading this, it kinda seems like an advertisment for Roller Derby. Well, it is - a bit. But only because it has such a massive variety of people in it, and the social aspects of it make it awesome for developing human contact skills)

So here's the summary.  Meet hot chicks that you KNOW are out of bounds. Don't even try. Help out. Be useful. Be nice. It doesn't matter if you're 200kg,  covered in acne and have a gimpy leg. Or 5"" nothing, and weigh 40kg. Your outside appearance is irrelevant.  The idea is to get you used to talking to girls. 

Once you're comfortable with this (and, this is most FA's problem - they've never learned this skill.  Yes, it's a skill, like hammering a nail, or riding a bike) it's no longer challenging. And it's not a HARD skill, just a skill you need practice with. Sure you may have bent the first hundred or so nails you tried to hammer in. But after that, it's easy. You may have fallen off that bike 20 or 30 times before you learned to ride it without training wheels. 

Now it's not an issue talking to a random girl. Hey, you've just come from a stake session where 30 girls wearing almost nothing were beating the crap out of each other. This chick at the bar? Man, she's got NOTHING compared to your girls. 

And, if you do decide to try my advice, and follow this path to nirvana (or at least being comfortable talking to girls), may I offer one derby-specific piece of advice. They all talk about each other. They all bitch about each other. If someone tells you something, it stays with you. Don't share it with anyone else. Just because the girl said that to you 5 minutes ago, it doesn't mean she's feeling that way now. Always respond neutrally. Never take sides. The girl A that told you she hated girl B? Actually, she's best friends with B, and if B hears that A hates her, she's going to know who blabbed. And suddenly you're branded a gossiper. (Note that this applies to EVERYWHERE. But I thought I'd sneak it in here, anyway)

And let me emphasize this once more. The Derby Girls are not for hooking up with. They are there purely for YOUR training purposes.  The best kind of deal has both people in front, right? You're in front, because you're practicing your 'being social with girls' skills. They're in front, because they have someone who can effortlessly build them a website, organise their scoring, or video their bouts and stick it on youtube for them.  If you can't do any of those things, you can be the person that is there whenever they need help, doing whatever needs to be done  You pay the price of being THEIR bitch, in order to make them YOUR bitches. 

Everyone wins. That's the best kind of situation you could hope for.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_127rvs,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/127rvs/so_i_apparently_should_submit_this_here_sick_of/,

This week has had it's ups and downs. I failed on working out, due to working at horrible hours (never got to bed on time all week), and going out of town twice (first to my hometown, and then to Maryland for work).

Besides that though, the week has actually been pretty awesome. I finished ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", and have been putting the tips I learned into practice.

Wednesday &amp; Thursday: Traveled to Maryland for work, memorized the names of everyone I met after hearing their names once, and I used eye contact to impress the client (even impressed the CEO of the client's company, so that was great). I also found out on this day that my younger sister wouldn't be able to accompany me to an event I had already purchased tickets for. While bummed, I used it as an opportunity to try to get a date... I posted on reddit, and happened to get *three* positive responses.

Friday: Went to hang out with some redditors again (that I met last week). I remembered *every single* name and greeted them as such when I showed up. It helped *tremendously* in how I was received. I met a handful more new people, and actually started to build some friendships already. I'm blown away. I also got to talk to a very pretty girl for about an hour. I found out later from her FB profile that she's ""in a relationship"", but I don't care, because I didn't know that at the time and I did a great job of using eye contact, talking about stuff she cared about, and remembering her name. She specifically said goodbye to me as she left for the night, so I felt pretty damn good about it.

Saturday: I went to the annual reddit meetup for my city. I was the *only* person there to focus on people's names. I played it as a party trick a few times, introducing new people by reciting everyone's name to the new person (it got up to around 15 names). I also made sure to say goodbye to people by name individually as I left. **Seriously, remembering and using names make a huge difference in how easy it is to make new friends.**

On Saturday I also went to that event with a girl that responded to the post I made on Wednesday. It was *awesome*. I got to hang out with a very pretty girl for about 8 hours. We enjoyed the event, and then even ended up back at my place to smoke and watch Futurama. It was perfect imo. She claims she'd like to go on a second date too, which is *crazy awesome*, so we'll see! It's this reason that I'm still grinning like an idiot, and this post is probably not written as well as my normal posts.

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I've realized that I still have time. My teen years were awkward as hell. Even my first year of college was. I'm sick and tired of not having control of my life, and now that I'm out of high school, I don't have to let it be. Tonight I realized everything that has to be done:

1. I'm dropping out of university next week. My semester is over and I only went because my parents insisted on it. I found nothing there and I'm taking a year off to work, save money and buy a car. Then I'm going to community college to get a degree in business management.

2. I got a job. My first point led to this, but I need to reiterate. As soon as I'm done with training, I'm going to work max hours every week. Thankfully the department store I work at only has 1-2 cashiers working at a time and there are always cashier hours to pick up. This means I'm working 40 hours a week. I might even get another job later this year. And I'm going to be frugal with my money, saving most of it.

3. When I get my first paycheck I'm going to start a gym membership. I've been a distance runner for three years but that's ALL I can do. I lost sixty pounds in high school and I currently run 4-5 miles a day as it is. My entire upper body is undefined skin and bones and I'm going to start a regimen of running and intense upper body workouts. Not for bulk, but for definition.

4. To add to my last point, I'm also going to start looking into some outdoor activities. I was recently inspired to look into rock climbing/repelling. I've also always mountain biked and it's one of my favorite things to do. Once I get a car I'm definitely going to look in my area for places to do that. I live in West Virginia, so you better believe we've got some mountains to conquer!

5. I'm deleting my Facebook in a few days. I'm sending messages to the few people on there that mattered to me and one of them includes my high school crush. I'm going to hopefully get her number and ask her out this summer. That's a goal of mine. I don't see why she would say no as we've been close in years past. I just need time to work up the balls. Just reconnecting with her will do for now.

6. I'm getting a tattoo removed. Long story short, I got a silly tattoo two years ago and I've been regretting it a lot lately. It hasn't affected me much, but it's still a reminder of a lapse in judgement. Instead of living with it and being in denial about the fact that I made a stupid decision, I'm going to own up to my stupid decision and address it as soon as I have the money and transportation.

7. I'm going to look into ways that I can be more social! There's a hobby/tabletop gaming shop that I live by and I'm a shameless otaku/geek. I know a lot of the people there will be just as geeky and awkward as me, so I think that it will be a great place for me to find some new friends that I can connect to better than the ones I have right now who I've grown apart from.

I know that this was a rather long post, but these are the steps I'm taking to become my own man with a firm grip on my life. Please wish me luck and better yet, give me advice! I'd appreciate it a lot, especially from anyone who's been in my position.

Hence the reasons for steps 4 and 5. After reading these books, I felt I had a good idea of what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong. I wanted to go out and try again.

I joined a local sports/social scene where people play kickball and then hit the bars later. I got a girls number from my team relatively easily. But this is not the story I want to tell.

*Halloween 2011*

I put on a ridiculous beer costume, walked out onto the street and said, ""I have no idea what I'm going to do, but I'm going to find something and just do it"". Within seconds I approach a group and talk to the guy. They ask me if I'm going to this frat party around the corner. I said yes. ....So now I'm going to a frat party.

I walk in and it's a typical college frat party. Natty lite, etc. It's very easy to approach people because everyone is wearing costumes which is a natural conversation starter. I talk to half a dozen girls and my conversations are going great. I realize that I enter into this awesome 'frame of mind' ...Like ...I felt awesome and that I believed I genuinely was a boss at being social. It's difficult to explain, but it's kind of like a high. You can approach anyone and just feel great regardless of what happens.

The party gets busted by the cops.

I walk out onto the street and I realize my night is not over. I feel amazing and I'm going to continue having fun. 

I see two really cute girls walking towards me on the sidewalk. I approach them in my beer costume and ask them for directions in my fake (but authentic sounding Irish accent). They give me directions, but the directions were wrong so I call them out on it and say I'm actually ""an employee of the school tasked with testing freshman on giving directions to random strangers"" ...I talk with these two girls for an hour and get their numbers.

I schedule a date with the one I was interested in.

The date was a lot of fun. Went to get ice cream, then walked along the waterfront in my city, and ended up at the roof of a popular building with a great view. It is there that I kissed her.

Though we agreed nothing was going to come of it, it felt great to have my first real success no more than a month after starting my change.

(xpost from /r/seduction),,8,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/19o05g/how_does_an_overly_literal_intellectual_become_a/,"And by 'conversationalist' I'm not referring simply to one who understands the fundamentals of carrying an intellectually stimulating conversation with threading, questions about other parties, and the like. That's a fairly easy set of algorithms.

The sexually charged conversations one has with women in order to build emotional rapport are obviously very different from those one would have at a cocktail party. The trouble is that this kind of interaction is utterly alien to me. I've spent the past 27 years of my life immersed in a world of concepts and symbols - mathematics, physics, philosophy, etc. Talking about these things comes naturally, but engaging with people on a ""deeper"" level makes absolutely no sense. At all.

When I spot an attractive woman at a club, I'm not thinking to myself ""I want to engage in repartÃ©e with her for about 15 minutes before taking her back to place and shagging her senseless"". No, I want to shag her senseless immediately. I see the conversation as a mind-numbing charade that I have to go through just to tick off some checkboxes on a bureaucrat's form. And no, I don't see women this way all the time. Only at clubs, where I don't really have a chance to get to know them much better than their looks (because of the deafening music) and where they rarely seem interested in the ""getting to know you"" phase.

I conquered my approach anxiety a long time ago; I can now approach groups of attractive within a fraction of a second after spotting them. But I don't know what to say once we're past the opener. The other day I approached a girl at a department store, and things went well for the first two minutes until my overly literal mind kicked in and I stopped being funny (ran out of canned jokes). She asked me my opinion on what colour a shirt was, and I deadpanned with ""a mixture of navy blue and charcoal black"". That was a prime opportunity to respond with something wittier, something that would make her laugh, and I came up with that line of brilliance.

I'm guessing that I need to get into a very different mindset.

I'm not really a true forever alone, I've always had a wide circle of friends, hung out with the popular crowd in school and generally from any outsider looking in I appear completely socially adjusted and normal. My main problem is that I am now 22 and I still have very little sexual experience with women. The furthest I have gotten with women is brief kissing. 

Now this alone is troubling enough but the issue has spiralled into a frustrating mess in the past couple of months. About a year and a half ago I was very over weight, long story short I decided to do something about it, began lifting weights and dieting, lost over 50lbs and eventually got myself very light/lean. After leaning out I decided to try bulking up and have been lifting and eating a surplus since August. The point I'm coming to here basically is that I've never looked better and in the past couple of months I've been getting a huge amount of interest from women.

I cringe writing this but I know for sure I'm attractive now, I currently work as a bartender in a trendy nightclub and each and every night there are women approaching me, they giggle and whisper with their friends, flirt and generally make their attraction very obvious. This all sounds great, and on the outside I can smile, make them laugh, hold eye-contact just fine while there's a bar between us, but inevitably the night will come to a close and I'll leave the bar to go collect empty glasses. It's always at this point one or two girls I'll have served will stay back to talk with me. Sometimes they'll hint that they want to hang out when I get off, othertimes they'll hand me a napkin or something with their number on it. The worst for me is when they're nervous and they come up and tell me they don't usually do this, but they like me and want my phone number. If they ask me for my number I always tell them I have a girlfriend (which obviously I don't)... I can pretty much generate a huge amount of attraction up to the point where the girl eventually needs to take it further (because I won't), then I get consumed by anxiety and break the deal. I feel terrible when I shoot these girls down, or don't call the ones that give me their number. These people are brave enough to do what I can't and I pretty much end up becoming everything I'm afraid of.

I've never been on a date, I worry I wouldn't live up to the expectation they have from dealing with me at the bar. I worry that I'm a terrible kisser and I'm flat out terrified that when I eventually get to have sex I'll absolutely embarrass myself. This probably reads like the biggest first world problem in the universe as I honestly do have the opportunity to be with attractive women every single week.

Throwaway, obviously.  I've been single for a long time due to a lot of reasons.  They're all pretty much my own fault, which is good because it means they're in my power to change them, but I'm not sure exactly what to do differently.

Let's see...

1)  I have a pretty specific sort of guy that I'd be interested in.  It's nothing extreme.  I just want someone who is intelligent, decently attractive (I'm not super picky here) and shares my religious beliefs (this is the tough one.)  This makes it hard to meet anyone unless it's online or my place of worship because nearly all of the guys that approach me in my day-to-day life fall short of these criteria, but these are all requirements for me.  Of all of them, I'm *most* willing to negotiate on physical attractiveness, but I will *not* compromise on my religion.  This narrows my pool by quite a lot.

2) I'm majorly an introvert.  I prefer to go out on my own.  I don't usually go out with girlfriends, hang out in bars or whatever, etc.  I spend most of my time alone in coffeeshops because I'm a writer (passionate about it) but this makes it hard to meet people.  I'm pretty invested in my work and I think I come off as unapproachable when I'm writing, or people assume there's something wrong with me because I'm alone all the time?  Maybe, I don't know.

3)  I'm shy.  Even at my place of worship I know very few people.  It's a very large one and I'm sure there are lots of great guys just waiting for me to say hi but I'm too shy to do it; mainly because it seems like everyone is in groups and I'm all alone.  It's intimidating.

4)  I do have an online dating account but nothing has ever come of the people that I have met through it, usually because I was not interested.  I think that online dating kills the thrill of the chase for me and I just have no interest.  In the past the few relationships I've had began as friendships.  But at the moment there are no options in my friendship circle.

I've been severely messed up a while. I've blamed it on ""depression"". I honestly don't know what the fuck is wrong with me lately. But you need a little backstory to understand.

I'll make a long story short, and give you a quick run through of my life. I grew up the first 8 years of my life pretty cool, without problems. Then my dad got into drugs, beat the shit out of my mom, I watched. He got his shit together, for a while. Couple years go by, dad gets hurt on the job, gets addicted to painkillers. While he's out of work for a year, he's dependent on the painkillers. Workers comp quits paying him disability checks to settle the lawsuit, lawsuit falls through, dad fucks some shit up and gets arrested. Then quits painkillers cold turkey and we move in with my grandmother because we're broke. I'm 15 now. My grandmother knows everything, I can't be myself in my own house. After years of indoctrination, i converted to atheism this summer. All this time, im bullied, I hop from boyfriend to boyfriend, and I have no true friends who have my back. Bam. That's it in a nutshell.

But lately.. The past 6 months I have been in SUCH a slump. I feel so empty. But at the same time, I'm this huge raging sack of emotion. I struggle a lot with it. I'm insecure as fuck, even though guys tell me all the time that I'm pretty. I always see something bad when I look in the mirror. And I feel like I have to have a guy, it's a problem. I get depressed as hell when I don't have a boyfriend, and I'm constantly seeking companionship.. It's very hard for me to let people in. The boyfriends I have, yeah, I tell them all about my life, and the shit that's happened, but I just feel so disconnected from everyone, everything. I used to be a huge bucket of sunshine, always happy and pleasant, but lately.. I'm just so tired, exhausted, bitter, and truly unhappy. I put on a happy facade when I go to school and am around people, but my breakdowns are becoming more and more frequent. When I break down I cry and cry and get emo as fuck and want to hurt if not kill myself. I'd never do that, but I think about it, and it sounds so good in my head. It feels like people will care if I hurt myself. They'll feel bad, they'll pay attention. I am always criticizing myself. It's hard to see anything I do as good, I have confidence but at the same time I don't. I can sit here and tell you, yeah, I'm good at singing, riding horses, dancing, blah blah blah. But I just.. I don't feel good about myself. My grades have been falling. Given, I only have 3 B's, but I've never made a B in my life before this year. I was valedictorian at my old school, and I had no problem at school. But lately I just stopped doing anything. I can't get motivated. I'll have homework and say, oh, I'll just not do it, fuck it. I slack, on everything. I can't discipline myself to do what I need to do. I just wanna lay down and sleep, all the time. Even if I get enough sleep the night before. I have no energy anymore. I've stopped caring. I'm so numb to everything, but at the same time, everything hurts. I wonder what is wrong with me all the time. I seek companionship to feel better about myself. I have mood swings. I feel alone, so, so, so alone.

Do I need medication? Do I need to see a doctor? Or is this something wrong with just the way I'm living? I need guidance. I wanna feel better again, but.. Sometimes I feel like I'm too in touch with myself.. It's hard to explain, but it's this phenomenon in my head that's just screaming at me how I really don't know anybody. I am so separate from the rest of the world. I simply feel alone. I just want to like myself, I want to be happy. But my negativity and depressing outlook ruins it all. 

Please don't give me that crap where you tell me, oh, well if you want it bad enough, you'll just fix it. I DO WANT TO FIX IT. But this isn't something I know how to fix. I'm so deep in this mindset, it's like I'm buried. I need someone to tell me how to dig myself out. So please, help.

It's fairly simple between us, we met last year at an Architecture program at Carnegie Mellon University, now she goes there and I've started college in New York City. It isn't exactly a nice short train from NYC to Pittsburgh so I can't see her in person, though we do talk quite often over Skype or Facebook. If she were here, or I there it wouldn't be a problem and I'd ask her out to see how it would go (hopefully for the best).

So, first of all there are soo many occupied girls here. Like 85% of the girls I've talked to eventually mentions their boyfriend (like, ""Oh, me and my bf do that all the time!). And it always checks out on facebook. I dont really care though, just a bit disappointing it's this many. 

This is also great though, because then I relax easier as nothing is on the line, everything is just bonus and I like having friends. Yesterday though I chatted with this girl for two hours while we were out. She was so awesome, doing really cool research and studies. I started playfully teasing her for something, so she felt bad and then I put my arm around her and she leaned her head into mine all the while laughing. This was a long while before the bf came up, and it initially made me a bit sad in the moment, but it's really more like fuck it, she's awesome and I always like to be with people I find awesome, so it doesnt matter.

The point is however that I did this without any reading on the subject and stuff, I just did it naturally in the moment. That is awesome. Did not know I could do that.

Today we went out again, but this time I was just chilling, not drinking much, and I suddenly realized that I can actually do this. I can just approach random people and talk to them for 2 minutes to say hi and stuff, then excuse myself and leave if it fails and not give a shit about what just happened. It's good to just have introduced yourself so if you see them again you can just say hi. Usually people are too scared to do the same, so it's hard to fuck up too bad.

The worst harassment was from a schizophrenic relative; I was told by my own parents many times not to call the cops when I was hit or whenever I had to lock the door and when she chased after me and kicked down my door.  The humiliation hurt more than the punches or when she spit on me and I couldn't do a thing. Years later I tried to reconcile with her and she asked if i was gay and i said yes. She told me that I'll be homeless and have to suck cock for a living and yelled to my parents to kick the 'faggot' out of the house.

Later when she asked me why I don't like here she said  'what have i done to you' and I told he she said 'that's your problem'. We don't speak often because we have no respect for each other.

I know people had much worse childhoods, but that doesn't negate my experiences and thinking they didn't effect the way I am would be wrong and counter productive. Usually when I try to be nice people think I'm a facetious asshole if I try to complement or make small talk, because I'm not that happy and I'm socially awkward.

Now, I know I need to improve and resentment won't get me anywhere, and living well is the best revenge. How do you not let the past define you, when it feels like its with you on an unshakable instinctual level? Am I skipping a step by not trying to improve my self before trying to make nice with people?

How do you leave the past behind? How do you deal with seeing someone who caused you a lot of pain (is ignoring them enough), and when being treated contemptuously and passive aggressively by strangers brings out bad feelings, and you don't want to respond to cruelty with cruelty?

I'm interested in a friend of my best friend's sister, and she is in turn interested in me. I haven't been in a relationship in years; she has been single for a year after getting out of a long (years long) relationship. We've talked about seeing each other this weekend, but I've been putting off calling her because I'm nervous. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking the past few days, and I think one of the reasons that I am nervous is because I would feel more comfortable in an atmosphere with some friends to help the conversation along. I haven't been on a date in months; the last one I was on went perfectly, but two days later she wound up with some guy who helped her move three days before the date. (I was at work and couldn't help.) There's another reason that I am nervous: she's 35, and I am 27. I'm not sure what she's looking for, but I am not ready to be married. I kind of want to wait until I'm 30 or so before thinking about that. I am a FAer, after all.

I know I need to tell her what I'm thinking. I can only imagine her right now wondering why I haven't called yet. From what I hear, she knows I have the tendency to be nervous around women, but she probably didn't know it was crippling nervousness. I need to act quickly before she thinks I'm just not interested in her.

As per my previous posts this week, eye contact and names have been the biggest things in helping to improve my interactions with other people. I've realized that eye contact is much more difficult in a conversation than it is in passing. It's easy to remember in passing to look the other person in the eye, but over the course of a 30 minute conversation, it becomes much more difficult to remember the tips you're working on while also listening intently.

Names have been decently easy once I really started making them my top priority. I now know the names of six people at the local supermarket where I'm shopping every other day, (three of whom are roughly my age). In addition I met 8 new people last night and know all of their names, having remembered most of them after only being told once. If you include a few others, 15 names in one week is pretty darn impressive for me.

While I haven't gone out to get rejected per Step 3, I have made some great strides in ""putting myself out there"". I went to a meetup last Sunday, another meetup to see The Avengers on Thursday night, and then joined a new D&amp;D game that I found through reddit last night. I also signed up for speed dating next month, and asked some friends if they know anyone interested in going with me to see the touring version of Lion King next week since I unintentionally have an extra ticket.

Workouts are still going well, with my traveling this weekend resulting in my first ""break in the chain"", but I'm okay with that because I was being social during that time instead. I already weigh 247.5, which is the lowest I've weighed in 18 months -- I've spent most of the past year around 262.

I'm almost done with How to Win Friends and Influence People, and then I'll start focusing more on How to Talk to Anyone. In addition I've also bought a number of ""cooking for beginners"" books. Since I've cooked every meal at home for the past two weeks, I'm ready to start actually learning to cook.

Seriously, do it. Don't climb mountains? Find something else, do it, and have a life that's easy to talk about. I'm climbing one of my mountains this summer - I quit a really high profile internship to pursue a passion and a dream career in a different field. No money, no guarantees of anything but a hell of a conversation piece that might just turn into a startup or a job when I graduate. As a gamer/programmer/nerd I know how hard it can be initially to relate to people outside of my normal social groups, but if there's one surefire way to make those first connections it's to have something incredible to talk about. [Travel abroad](http://wwoof.reddit.com/), dump a couple hundred hours into a [project](http://www.reddit.com/r/projectreddit), min/max your [stats](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/). Go crazy!

-----------------------

One other note. I'm a rock climber (mostly indoors) and both of the climbing communities I've been a part of have been some of the most welcoming and friendly groups I've encountered. It's really fun, it's good for you, and it's surprisingly social. You have an easy conversation starter that never gets old - ""Have you tried this route? How do I do this hard part? Man, that route is really challenging/fun/etc"". Don't feel like people are criticizing you if they randomly give you pointers while you climb. Every single one of us wants to see you reach the top and will do what we can to help you. If you want to figure something out on your own, just politely say so! And if you're out of shape... don't get discouraged. You'd be surprised how fast your body will start shaping up!

I can also point to dysfunctional parents (not an extreme case but also not normal) and being bullied, but those can't explain:

- I have low sexual desire (kind of). I like to touch my junk and regularly have erections, but I don't feel like masturbating until orgasm as often as normal people report, usually it's 2/3 days at least, sometimes even up to several weeks.
- I have gynecomastia (a.k.a. man boobs). Not an extreme case.
- Now of course if I am here it's because I also have social anxiety and have had depression.
- And all of those are sympthoms of low testosterone. And it could very well be because I also have cryptorchidism (born with one testicle).
- When I wake up in the morning I feel very shy, it normally progressively disappears (somewhat) during the day.
- I remember already in elementary school, before being bullied, being different from other people, having ""weird"" hobbies, not socializing well.
- When I got my first computer I remember being immediately hooked. I could explain some pathetic experiences about my addiction but I prefer not to.

Yesterday I went out with my university colleagues and a group of them started playing the ""Never have I ever"" game. I absolutely couldn't relate to them and left feeling like shit.

I know that is a bad and unhelpful perspective.

I used to think that I just needed to remove that worry and express myself, but that isn't always the right answer. It can be great when spending time with a close friend, but in many social situations it is best to sometimes behave according to intelligent choices.

One example is how I might need to choose to do something to start a conversation with someone, and how without that choice there may not be a conversation. Another example is how sometimes it's best to choose particular things to say to optimize a particular outcome instead of revealing more relevant information or expressing what's on my mind. It seems obvious that socially successful people do these things.

Another area with two perspectives like this is caring about people. Caring can be based on anxiety and worry about the other person's state, how my actions affect them, and a sense of obligation. It can also be based on intelligent creative ideas and choices.

The really weird thing is how the good and bad perspectives are almost like mirror images. The basic thing I'm trying to do is similar or the same, but my mindset about it is totally different. Sometimes I can flip from one to the other. Good thoughts about how to intelligently do things in a social environment can lead to the bad perspective of anxiety and worry.

I'm not looking for responses about how the bad perspective is bad. I know that! I'm also not seeking to just minimize the bad perspective. That makes me FA! I need to figure out how to maximize the good perspective while preventing it from triggering the bad perspective, and minimizing the bad perspective.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_18for8,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/18for8/anxious_worry_vs_constructive_concern/,

This may sound harsh, but it works- SHUT THE FUCK UP. Notice I added a cuss word (*gasp*) in it to add emphasis. Lately I have bombarded on my front page with a whole load of questions, complaints, and advice from faimprovement- they are great and they are EXTREMELY helpful to me (when I am developing myself to become a better person)  and to probably to the rest of Reddit . However, I see a great flaw  to the system of the advice-help-improvement process. I will go in order to lay out my concern over you Comrades.

1) First off, faimprovement is NOT YOUR GOD DAMN CRUTCH to the ""menacing"" world of social interaction. Please, I beg of you, please DO NOT rely on faimprovement to solve all your social needs. YES, society has its bright and dark sides, YES, you are NOT perfect, and YES you should use faimprovement as your *guide* to success...however, NO,  please do not become dependent on faimprovement to light you along the way. You are the only captain of your own ship. Yes, that may sound frightening, but trust me, you will find on later on, steering on your own and learning on your own is extremely rewarding.

2) I cannot emphasize this any further- **The world is evil and unwelcome, only if you make it be**. These common thought process will only drive you down to bedrock.  It is an excuse to yourself. **You only suck, and you only are lonely, if you make it be** Keep thinking that. Keep reflecting on how much you suck, on how lonely you are, and how you have no talent whatsoever. Oh yeah? Keep thinking that, and prove to yourself that by reflecting on what you have done the past season/semester/trimester. Keep thinking on how nobody will like you. HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA LETS GO TO /R/FAIMROVEMENT RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL/WORK/BRUNCH AND FIND A MIRACULOUS CRUTCH. Don't do that to your self. Those kind of thinking(s) will only drive yourself to hell. It's counterproductive. I and many other people have gone that path, and hit a blank wall- Just do not.

3) How will you stop thinking that way you may ask? Well that is where the Third, **Tres Concept** kicks in. **You can do great, great things** And I don't mean it in the evil way, used by countless Masterminds in hit movies to recruit newbies, I mean truly, you can do what you can achieve. I don't care if no one likes you. I don't give a crud if you are weak, dumb, ugly, beautiful, or black, or asian, or tall, or short. These are all excuses. Ask yourself how many of you are there in the world? 1. My answer will the same for all of you- Uno. Yi. Ehad. Ein. Un. Isa. It is your own duty to make yourself as unique, as great, and as magnifiscent as you can possibly can. Remember **You are You.** Think about that, you know your own strengths and weaknesses. Practice, learn skills, do the things that you love-that will make you the best that you can be. The only obstacle to the world, is the mind.

Bonus: another note; it is incredibly important. **DO NOT CARE FOR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU**. You DO NOT (I don't hope so) wake up every morning to impress other people. Fuck it. Repeat after me. Fuck it. Take that attitude with you, and you will become the happiest person alive. 

So Redditors, Enough of Rambling. You have gone through enough. It is time. Go out there. Leap out, hop out there into the world of many great wonders. You will find many opportunities. You will find many many ""Double Rainbows"" along the path of life. Leap forward, and unlock your way out into the world. I have said enough. You have gone through enough. Enough is enough. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is time to change the world.

I've been trying the passive method of meeting people--just socializing among the people that happen to be taking the same classes as me, or the people that come in for tutoring--for 7 semesters.

So here's the exercise: watch the videos and pick out what you agree with and what you disagree with. Try to be rational and ask yourself why you agree or disagree with something, and then let's have a discussion. It's a thought and ""balancing"" exercise.

I completely disagree with the idea that men are somehow victims of feminism, or with the oversimplification of how people or relationships work(reward and punishment, expectations).

I was a little scrawny Asian and I didn't like that. I had friends there and it wasn't as bad as High School. In High School I became more distant and misunderstood. I really remember not having a group of friends to hang out with but it wasn't that bad. I had my moments but I definitely wasn't one of those ""normal"" kids. Heck, my younger brother has more of a solid social life in H.S than I did in mine. Anyways this isn't the issue and I've gotten over it and have learned a hundred to a thousand times about my race, who I am. What I am and so on (Still, there will always something to learn).

I still, really don't have friends. I go on FB to talk to one person (a friend since Middle School). Maybe I go on Skype to talk to random people that I've added in Omegle. It's pathetic but I have people around me and family to spend time this Christmas. I'd like to know, meet and greet people outside my circle but I am oppressive. I still don't like myself. I look like a mongoloid and I still want and need to get my teeth fixed (braces). I do accept myself. I accept myself more than I did before. Maybe I can say I lack confidence?

I am a still a recovering addict (masturbation).

I've always been useless at getting ladies' interests. This was a source of much grief growing up, but when school ended and I moved out, I made peace with it. I accepted my fate and focused on other things in life. I wouldn't say I was happy, but at least content.

But a couple years back that no longer felt enough. I'm not sure what changed. Maybe it was seeing more people my age getting families. Or maybe it was a diminishing circle of friends as you gradually lose contact or grow apart. All I know was that I no longer felt comfortable with the idea of spending the rest of my life alone.

So I started to shake things up. I took a bit better care of myself. Better clothes, better grooming, perfumes. I was already going to the gym, but I put a bit more effort into it. And I started forcing myself out of my comfort zone. Small things at first, like eye contact and smiling at strangers.

This took a while, but made me feel a lot better about myself and more comfortable around strangers. Then this summer I decided to tackle the real stuff, asking girls out or for their phone numbers.

Unfortunately the results so far have been abysmal. The grand total is one number, which did lead to a date, but I screwed that up by having no clue what to do.

I've tried to stay positive and keep on trying. But it's not going well. I could shrug it off a few times, but then it started to get to me. It's been eating away at me until I'm now in a rather miserable state (not that I was in a fantastic state to start with).

I'd like a decent social network and a girl.

I don't suffer from the typical FA problems(I love being around people and I'm extroverted) and even after attempts at self improvement I'm still very alone. I've done many things in an attempt to improve myself, yet I'm still friendless and forever single. I'm just frustrated with life.

I have no anxiety approaching women or talking to people, I'm comfortable even with public speaking, I dress well, my height is fine, I'm slim, I'm friendly, I'm well groomed. So I don't know what's missing. I think I'm sort of ugly face wise though(It's the only reason I can think of and often blame it on my face).

I am a great speaker, I suffer no anxiety or panic attacks when speaking to people like some fellow FA's. I'm comfortable in crowds and with women, I'm witty and a great conversationalist, I dress well, I'm tall, slim, I'm friendly and cultured, I'm well groomed,

I go to a small jr.college with a small amount of women, which significantly reduces my dating pool. On top of that EVERYONE commutes and there's no parties or anything like that. Social clubs at college have around 5 members. In addition to this there's never anyone on campus so I never see anyone because everyone leaves right after class. Most people already have their social networks outside of school, and the women almost always have boyfriends. I've had the worst time in this college, the loneliness and depression has made my academic progress suffer really badly. Maybe it's just my environment.

I really thought things would work out for me if I just improved myself, cheered up, learned to dress, improved my abilities with women, and became more open and social and didn't really care about the outcome of things. I've reached a level where women probably think I'm this cool guy but inside I'm still a kissless loser.

Perhaps there's something wrong with me...

Not having my social needs fulfilled has overflowed in other facets in my life and really destroyed my progress in other things.  I'm afraid soon enough I'll be forever single to the point where I'll never have a normal life and be emotionally and physically mature.  I constantly have this huge feeling of frustration, stress, and anxiety of being foreveralone. I always feel like I'm trapped in my situation.

I'm 22 years old now, I can't ever have a lot of lost experiences most people have in their teenage years, 

I'm getting older...I'm 22 now and soon after this December a new year will pass and I will still be alone.

Start off as forever alone overweight short dude, grade nine through out the four years I made several goals to become a better me. By the end I was everything I hoped for I was smart, fit, captain of the rugby team. I had my fair share of relationships as well. In grade 12 my father passed away. I fell, and I fell, and I hit the bottom of the barrel. After the funeral we had to go to his homeland and say goodbye for a second time. By the time I came back everyone either acted as though I was a social pariah or the event never took place. I struggled deeply with this especially since I had so many feelings leftover from the things I had suffered through, and the things that I had experienced because of him. The one thing I have not been able to get over is him drunkenly telling me he had enough of life and that I like him will be forever alone. It honestly feels like his words haunt me. I feel empty, I've had girlfriends and when I'm with them it feels like a giant glorious fuck you. But I just got dumped again, and I know why. No matter what I do that sense of emptiness continues to haunt me and adversely affects my relationships with people. It's not really a confidence issue so much as all I seek is validation. Through all the rough times though I've learned that validation from others is like a narcotic. Sure it makes you feel euphoric and warm for a while, but the feeling quickly subsists and leads to an even deeper abyss. It leads me into feeling as though I am being abandoned by humanity itself. The truth is I have abandoned myself. I let it get this far. I stopped loving the things that made me who I was. And the only way I know how to retrieve myself from my own self made abyss is by slowly reclaiming the things I love in my life. I love sports, am I playing any anymore? No. I love art and architecture, am I in any societies or clubs that would indulge me? No. I only do the things that temporarily satiate my need for entertainment. Instead of going out and indulging in the things I love I sit around, watch tv, play some games, and maybe go eat a burger. I forgot about the basic things that made me, ME. So after 5 years I think its time I start doing these things. I start taking care of myself, I reclaim the things that made me who I am. I'm going to be weird. And it's going to be awesome. I'll watch star trek marathons because I want to, and then go and play ball. Because that's who I am. I'm going to stop making excuses and do the things I want without even bringing it up to friends or anyone that could bring me down for doing it. Want to go on a juice fast? Fuck it! Do it! Essentially I want to start loving myself. Because realistically how can you expect for anyone to know and love you, if you don't really know and love yourself.

I just came back from Bikram yoga (hot yoga). Have you tried it? You really should! It's fantastic! Anyway, while there I met a new yoga instructor, and I thought that she was very attractive*. After the session she was standing behind the counter, so I walked up to her, and at this point I realized I have forgotten her name. So I asked her name again, and turns out that she forgot mine. We reintroduced each other with smiles and at this point I said ""Listen K., I hope it's not too forward of me, but would you like to go out sometime?"" Now, her reaction is the reason why I'm writing this report. She said ""I'm sorry, but I'm seeing someone."" What's so special about it is the WAY she said it. Her tone of voice and her body language clearly said that she was disappointed that she couldn't go out with me. Meaning that if she was single, she most likely would have said yes. In other words she rejected a date, not me.       
I came across this approach to thinking about rejections last week, and this was the first time I truly experienced it and was able to appreciate it. A lot of you guys ask ""How do I get over the rejection?"", because you assume that the girl is rejecting YOU, and your male ego can't handle it(male ego is very vulnerable), but that's not the case. You see, if you ask a girl out and she says ""no"" then she is REJECTING THE DATE, NOT YOU. If it's a girl you just approached, then she doesn't even know you, so how can she reject YOU as a person when she doesn't know who that person is? No, she just doesn't want to go out, or grab coffee, or do any of that. If it was another guy, she would have said the same thing. And there could be a million reasons why she's rejecting the date. Maybe she's having a bad day; maybe she just had a fight with a friend; maybe she's in a relationship; maybe she's not in a relationship, but is interested in someone; maybe she's on her period and doesn't feel good about herself; hell, maybe it's cold/hot out and she just wants to get home. There can be a million reasons. But there is one thing for sure: it's not you, because you're awesome(And I do mean you! Yes, specifically you!), it's just that she doesn't want to go out, but you're still awesome!       
And to finish my story: I smiled, said ""It's cool, no harm, no foul"", put on my shoes, wished her good night and went home. I visit this yoga studio regularly, so I know I'll see her again, and I'll be friendly to her again, and it's not awkward at all.      
Good luck!

*Side note: in order to develop the right mentality for successful interaction with people you have to stop categorizing women as ""hot"" and ""not hot"". If you are attracted to someone- then it is ""I find her attractive"", if not then- ""I'm not attracted to her"". Just because you don't find someone to be sexually(another important bit) attractive does not mean that they are not beautiful or attractive to other people. And also it does not mean that you shouldn't interact with them and get to know them. Don't be afraid to make friends with girls. Not all girls are for sex and relationships, some are just great people.

One of the major points of Thanksgiving is to reflect on the positive things in your life. Many of you already make a regular practice of this, but for everyone this is probably the perfect day to take a moment to dwell on what you really like about your life. This could be things like all the things you like about yourself, all the people in your life that you care about and care about you, all the progress that youâve made, all the good memories that you have, all the activities you really enjoy, all the small things that make your life that much better. No matter how you feel about your life right now, you could take time to enjoy the taste of your favorite food and your favorite alcohol, the sound of the voices of those you care about, the sights, sounds, and smells of a familiar or even an unfamiliar place. Thanksgiving just seems like a really good day to be positive.

One of the things on my list of things Iâm grateful for is all of you and the stories and advice that youâve shared. Thank you! Hope you have a really great Thanksgiving!

I am 23 and 100% inexperienced in everything sexual, never even held hands. 3 months ago I met this girl at a preparty we held in my dorm for a concert. I was running late from my workout so I met her first in the hallway coming from the shower in like a handkerchief towel, it was way too small but the last one I had. I handled this really awkwardly, but she did freeze up a bit herself as I said hi and passed her rushingly in a bit of shame clint eastwood gazing the ground. I am not proud of this.

Later on I see she looks a bit bored so I start talking to her and it goes pretty good for being me. She is from out of town and didnt know anyone there. Concert is good and fun times are had. I dont think much of it. Then last week she hits me up on facebook and say I should come to her city for this festival where the same band is playing. I say ok, but I hope she has a tent. Then she says she lives nearby, calls me silly and says she has a bed. Then I get the date. Of course it is the only weekend for the whole summer I have stone set plans with three old friends of mine before I go away for a year. So I bite it and say I cant go that weekend, sorry. The next week I travel away for a year and will be gone. She invited me to next year instead. She has no idea of my inexperience. Should I follow up on this? I am 90% sure she only wants to play because she mentioned she was so tired of having a bf after rushing living with her ex and is not looking for something new.

Most things happened with help of this and seduction subreddit. Yes i have rebuilt myself. No i havent rebuilt myself, i just destroyed myself, now im rebuilding normal man.

What happened yesterday. Okay maybe stupid, funny, but kitchen sink and bath tub pipes clogged. Stupid thing you know, you are the man and you have to deal with it.

But that shit reminded me when last year same happened. I was fat, i was depressed, and FZ girl decided she will share some nights in my flat, while she was with her boyfriend in town. Shit dude...

Today, man (me) made pipes clean, but still was suspicious. I remind, im rebuilting my persona.
Suddenly text from FZ girl (no contact in months): 

""You are pussy!"". 

Me:""?"" 

She:""You didnt text me bla bla like you dont know me""

Me: ""I was busy these days...and you should not send me that, because i can beat your pussy (frase that means

Me: ""Ok lets start from beggining ""How are you etc...""""..

She: ""Im good thanks im working etc...""

Me: ""Nononono, start from begining, ask me..."" and she starts

What i tested this night...that was shitty house music concert(?!) and i saw last girl i was trying to get (months ago, and yes, i did all wrong) and her and mine shitty friend and he was like sun ""Dude i started working as programmer"".. That guy sucks, arrays are science for him, but he have one thing: attitude, fucking attitude he does thing in his way, and world bends by his own rules. 
I can code shits in any programming language that he cant even read.
That is why im here.

Btw on my way home on bus stationd met a few friend girls drunk, with their friends. Excelent material for testing escalation ladders, and raport! Girls are dungeon, but alcohol destroys their walls (just as study material :P)

May 3

**How is what you're writing any different from every other technique out there?**

Regarding comparisons to all the other dating techniques out there (from a comment in another post): Yes, I agree. Many of the ideas are the same, especially about 'playing it cool' and stuff. I haven't read The Game, but have heard enough about it that I get the gist. I saw one episode of Mystery's VH1 TV show many years ago, and I also accidentally listened to a CD called ""The Art of Seduction"" which was in a used car an ex-boyfriend bought.

I feel like the biggest difference between what I'm writing and the others is that 1) I think it's fucked up to get women by making them feel bad about themselves, and 2) I am trying to emphasize that you should be genuine in your actions. Like, don't pretend to not care if she doesn't like you, get yourself to a place where you can really be fine with it. Improve yourself in ways that will benefit your overall life. I donât think itâs healthy to NEED someone in your life, but wanting is okay. Do you need a woman like you need food, water and sleep everyday? Why is that? Why canât you create your own happiness without a significant other? Maybe itâs time to look a little deeper in yourself.

Examples of what I donât like from the other guys: The negging technique. The first definition from Urban Dictionary: ""Low-grade insults meant to undermine the self-confidence of a woman so she might be more vulnerable to your advances."" No thanks. Then on Mystery's show, how he had a technique where you go to a club, see a girl you like, then go sit and talk to her friend while basically ignoring the one you really like. She's supposed to feel crap that you're ignoring her and start to want you in order to make herself feel more adequate. What the fuck? Finally, thereâs the CD I listened to. I think that was the worst one of all. The guy was basically saying that in order to get and keep a woman's attention, keep eating away at her self-esteem, drop in little compliments now and then, but keep her feeling bad about herself so she needs your validation constantly. What. The. Fuck. If a guy tried any of those things on me, I'd be like ""Are you serious? Go fuck yourself.""

I talked to a friend about these posts yesterday, and he said all of it is sleazy, including my way, no matter how you word it. Girls will know what you're trying to do and will see right through you. I disagreed. The stuff I'm typing would (and has) worked on me, even if no one else, because I feel that it is coming from a genuine place. The guy is not trying to 1) chisel away at my self-esteem, and 2) there is less awkwardness because I am the one who will approach him if Iâm interested in more (as opposed to him showering me with attention and me giving strong hints that Iâm not interested). Even if I THINK he's saying/doing stuff to try to get in my pants, he is still not trying to make me feel bad about myself and heâs not harassing me, so why should it bother me? It wouldn't. I have a few friends who are guys that I could tell were interested in me, but luckily they got the hint pretty quickly and we continued to be friends. There was no awkward âtalkâ about how they wanted to date me and me saying, sorry, letâs just stay friends. They had enough sense to get my hints and leave it alone. The guys Iâm thinking of are all happily attached now, and no, would not try to come on to me if we were alone together.

So that's it. The end.

Every time I go, I memorize the name of everyone that helps me, and make sure to call them by their name at least twice during the short time I'm there. I then come home, write the name down and doodle something related to their job, and stare at it for a minute or two, and then tear it up.

So far it's actually worked quite well, I've met 6 people at the grocery store, 3 around my age, and I can remember all their names and faces. Every time I go from now on I'm going to make sure I use their name in such a way that shows I remember it and I'm not just looking at their name tag.

I'm excited to try this out in a group of people. I think remembering their names after hearing it once will help me out a great deal in making friends.

Created this account today to deal with my loneliness (my one other account isn't anonymous). After having a pity party for a few hours (something I seem to end up doing once month), I stumbled upon this subreddit and decided to make a go of changing things.


**About Me:**
I'm a 25 yo male in an uncommon situation. I grew up in a very conservative Christian home and really only had friends at church, because I was never allowed to go hang out with school friends.

My entire life I've been kind of person who desires a few close friends. I prefer small-group scenarios and detest situations where I can't hear myself think (most bars, clubs, parties).

I messed up in college and had to move back home and switch schools. At the same time, I did a lot of soul searching and research and became an Atheist. As a result of these two things happening simultaneously, I lost every single friend I had, just because my Christian friends and I had next to nothing in common anymore (despite cordial exchanges), and my college friends lived too far away. I ended up with a few acquaintances, but no mutual friendships (I would support them or go to their gatherings, but they would never reciprocate).

I graduated college, and thanks to a great resume and hard work, landed a high paying salary job. I'm now 25, having lived by myself for 2 years, working from home, making $80k a year. I unintentionally gained 80 pounds in the past two years, due to my sedentary job and ordering way too much pizza and Chinese. I have a small handful of acquaintances, but still they're one-way friendships, and they *all* have significant others and other best friends. It happens often that they go hang out and I'm not invited. The girls all thought I was gay for an entire year because my apartment is too clean, I like Broadway, and I'm a ""nice guy"".

**Why does that matter?**

1) I work from home, so there's no opportunity to make any friends at work or school.

2) I make significantly more than any of my acquaintances, and I'm the only single one, so we're in very different stages of life.

3) My personality is such that all the typical places outside of work to make friends and meet girls are places that I can't stand for more than 10 minutes. Additionally, I have a hard time imagining myself actually meeting the right kind of people at such places.

4) A lot of my self-worth is derived from having close friends who ""are there for me"". Not in a needy way, but in a mutual ""we love to hang out together"" way. I haven't had this for 4 years, and it has really taken it's toll.

5) I live by myself, and thus have spent the majority of the past 2 years in complete isolation. Getting out of the house once a week, and hanging out with people once or twice a month for a few hours.

**The Good**

1) In the past year I've gotten to do some awesome stuff.
       - I saw 15 Broadway Shows in 18 days in NY.... alone.
       - I went to Germany, Venice, and Amsterdam.... *for a month*.... alone.
       - I went to Chicago, San Diego, Minneapolis, and Toledo.... alone.
       - I've seen Seinfeld, Tosh, Robin Williams, and Green Day.... alone.
       - Universal and Disney World... alone.

Note: I invited specific people, and blanket invitations on FB, etc. for every single one of these events, *offering to pay if someone couldn't afford it*, and still ended up going alone.


-----------------------------

**The Change**

In the past I've tried to motivate myself to lose weight. I've succeeded in dropping 10 pounds once, only to gain it back. This is my new plan.

I'm going to follow the steps outlined by [shakedown_st](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/o4mx5/start_here/), and document my progress. This account's posts will be limited to this process, so feel free to follow it if you want to see a complete journey.

**Long Term Goals**

1) Have close-friends that I can count on and hang out with several times a week.

2) Have a SO or at least go on a number of dates. Figure out where to meet the kind of girls I like.

3) Weigh roughly 180lbs with a toned body shape (currently 255lbs with a ""beer gut"", despite not liking beer).

4) Without changing *who I am*, mold myself into the kind of guy that women desire. I want a nerdy girl to *want me*.

5) ... ? What I don't know. I imagine there will be things along this journey that I realize I want that I don't even recognize right now.


**First Week Goals**

1) Wake up and go biking every morning.

2) Cook every single meal, with Saturday being a possible ""day off"".

3) Listen to [Book 1](http://www.audible.com/pd?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B002V8MHJ6) while biking.

4) Update with progress next Saturday.

5) Update w/ comments on my own posts each day, as my way of being accountable to something.

**CLARIFICATION**

I haven't followed all of Shakedown's journey, so I can't speak to his goals, but I have absolutely no desire to sleep with someone outside of a relationship. Perhaps that will change, but I doubt it. I want to be able to approach people and make friends, and go on dates and meet the right girl, but I'm not looking for one-night-stands.

First up was buying condoms.

I did this because I'd never done it, so it would force me out of my comfort zone, and so that it might help me believe that sex is an achievable goal for me. It also gives me one less excuse not to try and take a girl all the way even after just meeting her.

An interesting side effect of this is that I discovered that while I have an average sized cock, I had a slightly above average girth. That was a bit of a confidence booster. After all these years of porn I was left with the impression that my dick was small, and had now discovered that it is actually slightly above average. It also forced me to buy condoms not once, but twice. In what must have been a half hour interval at best. I decided to carry one with me at all times because, well, you never know.

The next important step after that was to do a cold approach. I had tried getting myself to do this years ago and always managed to psych myself out of it. I had to buy some pants anyway, so I went to a local store. There was a cute girl who worked there that I saw walking around while I was getting pants and trying them on, and she made an announcement or two about a sale or some such. She didn't really sound like she was having a fun time with it.

I was having a hard time psyching myself up to do it, so in my head I came up with a quick opener and a short script of how to handle her possible answers. I had the idea of doing a scottish accent to make it even more silly and uncomfortable for me and to help make it matter less. I got in line at her register and forced myself to talk to her, I made sure to be as playful as I could manage while utterly terrified. It went something like this:

*Her: ""Hi""
*Me: ""Hi there"" (scottish accent failed, abandon)
*Me: ""Can I ask your opinion on something?""
*Her: ""Sure""
*Me: ""What do you think of this outfit?""

She actually walks out from behind the register to get a good look, I'm surprised by this but I do the slightest of twirls so she can get a good look

* Her: ""I... I don't know"" She's still smiling at least

She's off script, for as much as there was a script

I decide to go with one of my canned answers anyway

* Me: ""Thats exactly what I was going for: total confusion!""

She laughs a little bit

She tells me the total and I hand over my debit card

* Her: ""Did you hear about the sales?""
* Me: ""Oh yes, you were quite enthusiastic.""

She laughs a little, silence

I get a ""bright"" idea

* Me: ""Have you tried accents?""
* Her: ""No""
* Me: ""I think you should, it would make it more fun""
* Her: ""No. Maybe I'll have someone else do it""
* Me: ""No, you should give it a shot""

I slip ""smoothly"" into scottish accent

* ScottishMe: ""Just go ahead and put on a scottish accent. It doesn't even matter if it's any good.""

* Her: ""Clever"" 

very little smile

Yeah, she's not having any of it

We finish up the transaction and I leave.

So she was uninterested. Worse things have happened and more importantly I did something I'd never done before. There were probably some ways I could have kept the conversation going, and believe me I did start to overanalyse this, but I've decided that I can't think like that anymore if I'm going to get where I want to go.

1372368849.0,3,self.faimprovement,1h7fiz,Is socializing in a non-positive way worthwhile?,dextroverted,3,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1h7fiz/is_socializing_in_a_nonpositive_way_worthwhile/,"If I want to actually socialize, recognizing the other person as a person and interacting in a way that's friendly and more than  ""mechanical"" and protocol-oriented (for stuff like buying goods in a store), then I feel an obligation to be positive. The only exceptions are if I'm angry at the person, in a place like /r/ForeverAlone where expression of negativity is ok, or interacting with someone I consider a close friend.

It can often be difficult to express positivity. My own mental state, and especially the mental state which I end up in when I try to socialize can involve substantial negativity. At the very least I can find it difficult to express positive energy. Attempts to fake it can be far too difficult, and they can even provoke more intense negativity inside as I see the contrast between how I feel and what I'm trying to express. I don't care what anyone else says about faking being a good strategy; for me faking happiness in social interactions is simply not sustainable.

Can it be worthwhile to socialize in a negative way? I'm not talking about being an asshole, but about saying negative things, expressing anxiety, not smiling, and so on. In the past, these things did slip out, but I considered that a mistake that I needed to avoid as much as possible. Should I just not give a fuck?

This morning I had an intense dream about this subject. It implied that the perceived need to act positively when socializing is a big part of why I did drugs.

This involves a sort of tension, and it isn't pleasant, but it isn't too bad.

It's not that I don't want to socialize at all; in fact, I crave socializing. I just can't imagine how socializing with a stranger or someone I don't know very well could go positively then. Also, my emotional state is such that I don't expect to be able to express positivity. My solitary mental state might have been positive, but it's a kind of escapist in-my-head positivity that is destroyed by trying to socialize.

If I'm feeling better, I can become more connected, and this can be much worse. Then, ignoring doesn't happen automatically, and I don't really want to do it deliberately. I want to socialize and I feel like I should, but I still don't know what to do and I'm stuck on that. My emotions in a social context still aren't very positive, for example, not allowing me to truly say hi in a positive way. This triggers an anxiety that is more painful than the automatic avoidance tension. It can also lead to a more problematic kind of avoidance, where I avoid being around people instead of just avoiding connection.

If I'm feeling even better, then this problem can disappear. Then I have genuine positivity to express, and I'm more creative and able to come up with things to say. If I could stay in this state, I could work on improving social skills, getting to know people and making friends. 

The problem here is that unless I go all the way to the good state, feeling better can actually make things worse. I think that's one of the key factors making me stuck as FA. The good state is still relatively rare in social situations. I need a better way of coping with that in-between state, where I'm opening up but finding social interaction very challenging.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_1h23k6,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1h23k6/anxiety_when_feeling_better_but_still_not_very/,

Maybe it's not you. Maybe you're not awkward, but your current peers are awkward. Maybe you're just generally incompatible with them. Maybe you don't hang out with them because inside, you really don't want to. And that's okay.

This is especially true if you're in a place (like school) where you feel constant pressure to make friends with people you meet everyday.

This is probably a common issue so I'm really hoping you guys could help me out. Wasn't sure if I should post here or depression or something but here seems pretty fitting.

Anyways, so basically when I receive attention - usually positive (obviously), but mixed attention is fine too - an amount of happiness pretty much floods my mind and it seems like the world is going to be a better place and I'm going to become a way better person and the sun is going to shine brighter. This happened the other day when I got a bunch of compliments about my looks and stuff from a picture I posted on twitter (lol) and bam holy shit my world was awesome.

And now I'm in this withdrawal kind of state where it seems like everything is terrible and there's something wrong with me and I'd do anything for someone to tell me how goddamn hot I am right now. 

But I want to change this so bad. I want to be happy no matter what, like, how do I fix this? 

TL;DR: got attention, felt like I was getting better, no longer feel like I'm getting better (presumably because of lack of comparable attention)

**Thoughts / Tips**

1. **Emotions will likely be the hardest part.** -- Internalizing self-worth and getting yourself on a stable emotional footing is likely to be the hardest part. It may be easy (as it was for me) *until* you start dating. Then the true rejection -- after a few dates -- will hurt like hell.
2. **Having another guy to talk to is VITAL to improvement.** -- This subreddit is *NOT* enough to support you when you're depressed or facing rejection. You absolutely 100% must find another person to talk to as soon as you start trying to improve yourself.
3. **Always discuss with your support person.** -- If I'd talked to my friend before sending that email, he could have stopped me or helped me revise it to get my point across without potentially scaring the girl away.
4. **Don't reply to a rejection while you're hurt.** -- Get your mind off it, give yourself time to process it. NOTE: I have no idea if this is good advice, but it's what I'm going to try next time.



**Personal Thoughts You Can Skip:**

The date yesterday was great -- we connected (so I thought) on every level. The chemistry was amazing, and we fit well together while just curled up on the couch, having fun the bedroom, and going out in public. She fed every desire/need I've had for the past... who knows how many lonely miserable years. She showed me that sex with someone you're attracted to is *amazing*. I mean... holy crap.

Then today comes around, and I receive an email. She cancels the date we planned for Monday, saying she needs more time. She likes me, but also sees some arrogance and coldness in me that didn't used to be there.

(Side note... WHAT?! Me, arrogant? More like me trying to have some modicum of self-confidence in front of a girl and I guess overcompensating? And cold? I felt closer to her yesterday than I think anyone else in my entire life.)

She also said that while there were parts of yesterday that still make her smile, there's other parts that send pangs of hurt through her. She won't tell me what, and I can't even really begin to guess (I didn't remember where she grew up, etc.?). So I was crushed. I read the email twice, and it felt like I'd messed everything up somehow. It was my fault once again, I was a loser who couldn't get anything right. I was arrogant and cold, and was a jerk who caused girls pain.

I snapped, was nearly in tears at a lan party, surrounded by couples gaming. I hid it as best I could and wrote a reply. BAD MOVE. Never write a reply when you're depressed... I swear that email I wrote sounds like a ForeverAlone post. i was honest and I hope that might win me some points, but I'm terrified now that I pushed her away. And since I've received no response email, I'm still terrified of that.

I was just about to write that she said she just needed time to digest everything and that we'd probably get together after my trip out of town, and then I re-read her email.

&gt; I think I need longer than a day to process everything.  So it might be wise to postpone our previously planned Monday rendezvous.

Now I realize that she never said if or when we'd get together again. I don't know if I can handle that being a one time experience...",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_twjap,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/twjap/emotions_and_a_support_system/,

And just like women, there exists a cutoff point for physical attractiveness - specifically, that of facial features - for men, below which no amount of charisma is useful.

What I just wrote flies in the face of most advice here and on r/Seduction, and I'm aware that your first instinct is to dismiss it as mere defeatism. But as someone who, despite having transformed into a charismatic and socially aware guy^1 , has made little progress with women since first stumbling upon the treasure-trove of information here, I am left with only one possible conclusion - my physical repulsiveness is insurmountable.

See, I'm a 23-year-old with advanced male pattern baldness, which makes me look more around 17 years older.^2 So I invariably come across as a creepy old guy trying to bed women young enough to be my daughters. As if that weren't enough, Nature has gifted me a truly horrific smile. I look much better with [this expression](http://www.yornet.net/mediaObject/NEWS/news_photo/dmitry-medvedev-vladimir-putin/original/dmitry-medvedev-vladimir-putin.jpg) (or even a slight smile), than with a laugh or a toothy grin.

Your success with Shakedown and similar compilations should be attributed at least partially to your good fortune of being above the cutoff. It's admittedly a *very low* cutoff, but there nonetheless exist more than a few men who are below that line.

The idea is that weâd be paired with up to six mentors from /r/datingadvice, /r/psychology, or some similar subreddit and, over time, helped to change both the belief system and set of corresponding actions that I believe keeps us alone.

This is a group mentoring project because I think groups are invaluable when trying to overcome challenges like this. Groups have deeper wisdom and often come up with better decisions than an individual would alone. Groups can also be much more motivating; not least because if you promise a group youâre going to do something itâs much more likely youâll do it.

Once weâve described ourselves and what weâre looking for weâll be paired with our mentors. Theyâll want to know more about us, particularly about the things that have gone wrong in the past or what we think is holding us back. Itâs very important to be honest here, the more open we can be about our perceived failings the more we can be helped. 

Once the background work has been done, our mentors will work with us to set deadline-driven, challenging (but achievable), measurable steps to take towards our goal. The deadline helps us focus. The challenging but achievable steps develops our sense of self-determination. The measurable nature helps us understand weâre making progress. 

This is an action-orientated project, but our since actions are shaped so significantly by our belief system itâs vital we deal with that too. Therefore, the mentors will help us reinterpret whatever it is weâve told ourselves about why weâve failed so far, in order we understand that what went wrong is not due to something permanent and unchangeable about us or our luck. This will be an ongoing process because itâs likely weâll encounter bumps along the way and weâll need to be careful not to be catastrophic about them too.

Weâll need to be honest, weâll need to do things we find difficult and weâll need to commit to the process. If we do that I think weâll be successful. Anyone else want to see if Iâm right?

So if you enjoyed that read, you will really enjoy this book as well. There are numerous books on the subject though. I found this to be a fascinating read. Additionally, reading this makes for great conversation topics. Women love hearing about the differences between men and women.

It goes into the psychology of each gender and explains why men do certain things and why women do certain things (such as why women love shopping and men don't). It provides great advice in how to handle various situations (when someone uses emotional blackmail).

The greatest piece of advice I took away from the book is the differences between the way men and women communicate. When men talk, we tend to give advice. Someone comes to you with a problem, it is your natural tendency to help come up with viable solutions. However, when a woman wants to talk about her problems, she actually doesn't want solutions. She just wants to talk and for you to listen and be empathetic. As males, we find this odd. Why talk about your problems if you aren't going to seek advice on how to solve them? Women talk to relieve their stress and feel better. When you start giving them advice and telling them what they should do, they feel as if you aren't listening! Weird, huh? Unless they specifically ask you what they should do, just nod your head and show empathy.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_oe0m8,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/oe0m8/step_9_understanding_the_other_gender/,

Much, if not all of this can be attributed to me being home schooled. I also have social anxiety for which I began seeing a therapist a little over a month ago and taking medication. All was seeming to get better. There was this girl in one of my classes, and we have a lot of things in common. So one day I struck up a conversation with her and we talked while leaving class. This was big for me, as it was the first time I've ever approached a girl, and it went well. We began hanging out some after class in the school cafeteria, and we talked leaving class ever since I approached her. Fast forward to today, I made her a customized card and bought her a chocolate bar to give to her when, during class I figured out she had a boyfriend. I want to say that I don't think she was ever necessarily flirting, but just being nice and acting like a friend would. This is where I'm confused. I would still like to hang out with her but I almost feel guilty about it because even though I just like hanging out with her without any romanticism involved, I imagine it stems from the fact that she's an attractive woman who shares my interests and the reason that I want to hang out with her may be my desire for a relationship even though she has a boyfriend. She has to know I like her, and I don't want to seem like I'm just ignoring the fact that she has a boyfriend even though that may be what I'm doing.... Keep in mind, I have absolutely no experience with relationships outside of family. 

Today was the first day we didn't talk leaving class but its because we didn't leave the room at the same time and I didn't want to wait and seem desperate, or something, I don't really know. Is it weird to continue talking leaving class and hanging out if she knows I'm interested but she knows that I know shes in a relationship?

Anyway, I think this hurts even more because it seems like I'm starting from square one again. A month ago, I had never approached a girl or really talked to one outside of family. Now, the girl I hoped could be my first relationship is already in one and I don't know what to do. I also don't want it to be awkward between us. She may not even be thinking about this at all, (she probably isn't) but I don't want to make it awkward by over-anylyzing.

I want to try and meet other girls and not try and hang on to one who is in a relationship, but she just seems amazing and I haven't met anyone like her.. I also don't know how to go about approaching other girls if there is no clear shared interests between us.

Right now it just seems like I wont meet someone like her again, even though its possible that if I began talking to to other girls that I would feel the same way about them. I don't know if some of these feelings are just a result of the fact that shes really the first girl I've hang out with/talked to.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I guess I just needed to vent. It's valentines day, I had a let down, and I am feeling depressed again.

They are guys I guess though so they will talk shit but especially when im in a down mood it gets hard to take it that way as a joke. I know I have been diagnosed with major depression before but I hate feeling ""weak"" so ive been trying to ignore it and fight it on my own. It feels so bad sometimes and I can make it go away for awhile through distraction or exercise but I just look back on my life and it feels like a big void sometimes, like there is just nothing there. Its all been a history of trying to get over my issues obsessively and never really finding the key to get out. I get so fucking jealous and angry at the other people out there, normal lives and good friends...not feeling insecure or depressed or anxious or scared every bloody second. They always seem to have these awesome stories or good memories that I just don't have. I was diagnosed with slight aspergers around 10 or so, always fighted/denied it. It made me very depressed dealing with all the social rejection when I was younger and I became a MAJOR shut-in.

Its left me with scars and a huge feeling of needing to prove myself and make up for lost time...all I care about is proving to them that I am not a loser anymore...but it seems like no matter what I try or do socially I always mis-step somehow socially in unseen ways and I NEVER get feedback on what I do wrong so I have no fucking clue how to get better. 

But I want to prove them all wrong, I want to be the one with power for once...the one that they are jealous of...petty? yeah, but im tired of it. I know that most people out there only care about themselves so what gives? I want mine...

and really I find it annoying that my mom always had to hammer home the point that they just don't see how ""special"" you are or how ""nice"" you are. Fuck, wish she would have been bloody honest instead of sugar coating every goddamn thing it made me weak. People are attracted to abundance, repelled by scarcity...if you aren't funny, cool, outgoing, relaxed, happy they could give a flying fuck about you beyond a passing socially constructed nicety platitude. Of all the facts I know about human nature, this is the one that saddens me the most...pure disillusionment the world is alot colder and harsher then they let on.

24/M

I'm not anti-social or anything, I can talk to anyone, often too much, but one of my things is I typically try to picture myself with others. This isn't always a romantic type setting, I just daydream a lot. I try to better understand others by viewing them in other situations, a movie, a date, a park, anything. If it is a girl that I think is cute, I might imagine us together, cuddling, kissing, or if my mind really wanders (not often), married with kids or something.

Well, I was doing this today while in a conversation with 3 or so others and put myself into a daydream about being with a girl I have a bit of a crush on, and then kind of became somewhat turned off towards her. I'm starting to wonder if I do this often, but I think part of it is I can't really see myself with anyone. I'm an odd duck, religiously and philosophically and such.

I love my family and close friends, I'm the type to do hugs with just about anyone close. I'm really just questioning my capacity to get close to women though, I'm not sure I could ever really love someone.

When we were communicating it seemed great. They were friendly, they seemed to like me, and we happily talked about various things that interested both of us. However, at other times, they would ignore electronic messages, not answer the phone and always postpone meetups or schedule something and be unreachable. If I asked about this, I would get generic excuses like that theyâre busy or forgetful. There was never any statement that they didnât want to stay in touch or be friends, even if I asked.

In one case it was someone who I seemed to get along with great otherwise, and thought I was becoming friends with. The rest happened after friendships that lasted for several years without such problems and had become integral parts of my life.

I donât know how to constructively react to this. The way I reacted before, with a lot of focus on the problem and fruitless attempts to fix it, caused a lot of suffering, contributed a lot toward making me FA and made me hate people. 

Pointing out the problem and asking nicely doesnât help much. It would at best cause a temporary improvement followed by a resumption of the old pattern. Getting upset about it is not any more helpful, and it is very destructive to the friendship. Trolling them by sending them messages which compel them to respond is somewhat effective, but I donât really care about that sort of friendship. The most constructive response I can think of is to simply accept them that way. That avoids causing additional harm to the friendship, but I donât like such a submissive surrendering response. Perhaps the most satisfying response is to ignore and disrespect them in return, and be less willing to help when they ask for help. This is however not constructive.

I guess the only real âsolutionâ is that I must not be in a situation where someone becoming unavailable would result in problematic loneliness.  In other words, I need to have sufficient friends and social skills that this isnât a problem and I can simply make new friends whenever.",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_15oodo,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/15oodo/how_to_react_when_a_friend_doesnt_reliably_stay/,

I am a 23 old guy who seems to be a forever alone type of dude like many around. I graduated college recently and moved back home to pretty much start working. I have a rather good job for out of college, as I am an accountant at a bank Mid-sized bank operations center (meaning I donât really see very many people) I am living at home with my Mom, however I have a personal goal to leave within the next 18 months after I achieve my CPA License (which is a rather large pay increase for the less business types.) 

Also I want to note although I have had several Friends that were girls, no girlfriends (still waiting on a first kiss). Which I know is not uncommon, but wanted to point that out here and get it off my chest here. 

Now as to why I am here posting today.
 
In college I had always a rather tight-knit group of friend I hung around with. I was more than likely less social outside of that group, but I seem to be able to carry on a conversation with several stranger only in the presence of my close friends. 

Now that I have moved away from my friends Fort Myers, FL to West Palm Beach, FL (2 hours away)  I have seemed to become ever more anti-social now unless itâs with my family members. They all have their own lives though, so I have begun to be at a bit of a loss/struggle here.

Let me tell you where I am at. I work with majority of older people, so unless I have plans to hang out with a family member (maybe once a week) I am pretty much on my own majority of the time. I do not really freeze up talking with strangers, but I donât seek out those conversations either; and carrying on a conversation doesnât really happen either. I am too much a thinker I suppose. I kind of wanted to meet people, so I have been attempting to just go out to a bar/restaurant to some degree of self-help. 

I must also note that I have also been able to utilize some free time, and have gotten down to going to the gym at least 4 times a week. Mainly running/dieting to lose weight (although I am still overweight), and I am currently 250 down from 290lbs in 6 months. That process is beginning to feel regular at this point. 

Realizing something needed to change in my personality thought process, I stumbled upon this subredit not 3 hours ago, due to a r/bestof post on my front page. I hit the start here post, and literally have been reading the shakedown method rather intensely since then. It seems to be the guide, per se, that might lead to the change I need to not only find that girl, but also become a more social/confident person in general. I am confident I am that nice guy, but socially I have a lot to work on. 

Was coming here and giving a serious try to this method a good thing? I actually havenât checked to see about any success stories yet, feel free to tell me yours!

I am currently 70% ready to give this method a shot starting tomorrow, just needed some kind of confidence boost here to see if it a legitimate thing to try and help me. Anything else to help me out would be great!

After lot of trying, learning, gaining confidence etc, i'm now close to the beginning. It is hard to rebuild your NG paradigms. I can't break trough one thing, i can't approach to the girl, i can't start conversation out in bar or club. Over a years of FA i became alcoholic, and i feel like alcohol is helping me, but no, it just makes me more confused, and more affraid. Most people i know think im interesting, with wide range of subjects for talk. But when i have to talk to girl, i feel like Patrick from Sponge Bob. Nothing, blocked, stuck.
Another problem is i always expect something to happen, i can't just flow. Somewhere in my mind there is catchy worm (and it grew over a time of FAI) that says anytime i go out ""Oh dude you're totally geting laid tonight"". No, i don't, no i never got laid, in my entire life. Depressing.

(and kinkiness),CaptainAlone,4,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/tswx1/successes_and_thoughts_and_kinkiness/,"If you've been following my journey, you probably read earlier this week that I had a [great date](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/tkszb/week_3_recap/) with a girl 5 years younger (she's 20). I then got concerned that I was growing [too attached to her](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/tmzpf/how_to_avoid_growing_too_attached/) too quickly, and I was doing foolish things like chatting with her online every day for *way* too long. She does live about an hour away, but after [Wiretap's advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/tmzpf/how_to_avoid_growing_too_attached/c4odf3l), I realized I was friend-zoning myself simply by being *too available*. I've since backed off the conversation, and made it very clear that my life is too busy to talk so much, but that I very much want a second date -- and plans are in the works to do so after I get back from Vegas (oh yeah, I'm going to Vegas by myself for vacation). *The dynamic between us already seems healthier, and more flirtatious.*

As I described in my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/smdv7/time_for_me_to_change_step_01/), I've had some one-way friendships, so I wasn't quite as ""Forever Alone"" as some people, but the pervading sense of loneliness was still there, and I wasn't appreciated by anyone. In just 25 days, *I've improved those friendships to be a bit closer to equal give-and-take.* I did this by being vocal about when I want to hang out and what I want to do, as well as using the tips in How to Win Friends to make myself more engaging and fun to be around. I also have about 5 new friendships that are just forming with people I've met at reddit meetups.

I haven't talked much about my dating life previously... I had several girlfriends in high school, and my girlfriend when I was 18 lasted an entire year. After that though, I only had a broken friends-with-benefits relationship in college, where I let my heart get trounced because I was in a [position of scarcity](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/tmzpf/how_to_avoid_growing_too_attached/c4o4pal). Despite that arrangement, **I still didn't officially lose my virginity until I was 24**. When I did, it was with a girl I met on the internet and wasn't attracted to, and our ""relationship"" only consisted of about six dates. However it did provide me with confidence, which I'm definitely drawing upon these days.

Fast forward to today. In the past month I've had the opportunity to take four girls out on dates. Two I turned down because of scheduling conflicts (and the opportunity has passed), and the other two I've taken out. *Both girls want a second date.* Tonight was one of those two dates...

**Thoughts on ""The Game"":**

I'm two hours into the audiobook, which is roughly halfway through the book. I've gotten used to Style's voice finally (he narrates the audiobook himself)... though he still sounds like a college aged douche. I like how thus far it's purely his story. It explains things about the PUA scene, and even gives some tips, but it doesn't focus on how to manipulate girls -- in fact he just started talking about how he hated that aspect from the start.

There are things he mentions that are simple and makes sense though.

* Never approach a girl from behind.
* Lean backwards or face slightly away.
* Don't sit on the opposite side of the table from the girl you like, sit next to her.
* Wear one thing that makes you easily approachable.

I used all of these tips on my date tonight, and I could tell the difference. I made sure not to appear to be overly interested or lean in at all. Halfway through the date *she was leaning in towards me*. I knew I'd get a real hookup at that point. I shed any buried nervousness, and pressed forward with kino, getting her arm looped through mine, and eventually the kiss goodnight.

**TL;DR...**

* **My friendships are improving, and I've made new friends.**

That semester I made a crucial decision, I would begin almost living in the library. I had forced myself to concentrate, kicked the tobacco usage, ditched my friends and began lifting to a schedule. Everything worked out well, instead of retaking courses, I took graduate versions of the same courses. For two years I sacrificed my social life, did well in classes. I applied to graduate schools but I do not expect to get in anywhere (the institution which I am at currently just sent me a rejection letter even though I've taken a lot of the graduate courses and am actively doing research ). Now its the end of my fifth year, I and the one thing that keeps dragging me into depression is I've never held a girls hand, kissed a girl or really been on a date.

It's completely irrational, I'm fit (I climb, cycle and lift), intelligent and healthy, yet I seem to be getting no where in life.
I've asked girls on coffee dates but I've never received a positive answer. At this point my physics gpa is a 2.92, and all I can think about is what a failure I am; branded my that damn number. I'm 22 and I've already failed at life. I know I am better off a majority of people in the world yet is it too much to ask to be human, to tell someone you enjoy their company or even possibly kiss a woman. I suppose I'm an envious and selfish person. It's my last semester, I just want to understand what it is to be human.

Anway, 8 weeks left of college, I need to take advantage of my situation while it lasts.

This is just my journey.

[Book one ""No More Mr. Nice Guy!""](http://www.amazon.com/No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/0762415339/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335393506&amp;sr=1-1) was enlightening and informative. I highly recommend the [Audible.com Audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002V8MHJ6&amp;qid=1335393790&amp;sr=1-1). However, you're probably going to want to at least get the kindle version of the book too, so that you have a reference for the activities he asks you to do. And yes I do recommend doing them even if they seem trivial.

**Personal Reflection:** For me personally, it taught me more about how I used to be than how I am now. Everything he talked about described me throughout high school and college. Once I started living on my own, a lot of that faded, because I had to learn to be happy with myself, by myself. However, I still participate in self-destructive behavior, don't have a good view of masculinity, and let fear run much of my life (social situations, etc.). I think I've swung too far towards being selfish, over-correcting if you will.

**The Bad / Things I Disagree With:** 
Seems to me that the book is outdated. It's written in 2003, and it acts as if internet pornography is still partaken in by the minority, when nowadays everyone in my generation seems to partake in it, though some may be ashamed of that fact and hide it. I'm going to do my best to give it up, but I may partake every once in a while after a ""moratorium"" time period, because I don't find it to be as detrimental as he claims, when taken in moderation.

The book is also heavily geared towards men in marriages, or at least committed long term relationships. It talks constantly about ""your partner"". This was very hard for me to get past without letting it further degrade my self-esteem. Evidently most nice guys don't have any problem getting a wife, even if she is a ""fixer-upper"". Somehow I haven't had any luck finding a girl at all. But at least now I can fix some things before they become problems.

**Putting it into practice...**

In hindsight, this book gave me some knowledge and steps to take (facing fears, not procrastinating, taking care of myself), but all those were things that I already knew I needed to do, and I haven't done simply because of a lack of willpower. So now I just need to have a system for increasing my willpower. Here are some things I'm going to do in order to actually put this into practice.

* **[""Don't Break the Chain""](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/srab4/dont_break_the_chain/)** -- used for exercising, getting to bed on time, eating healthy
* **[Have a Bucket List](http://i.imgur.com/t7HuR.jpg)** - Make a spreadsheet or list of things you want to do in your life. Then strive to achieve one or two items every year, and mark down what date you did them. This is a fun activity to do with an internet acquaintance.
* **Face your fears.** -- Don't be afraid to work out in front of people, ask girls out, or ask to join a group of people. And while you're at it, face less practical fears -- go skydiving if you're afraid of heights, or go give a talk somewhere if you're afraid of public speaking.
* **Finish Your Projects.** -- Don't start a new project until you finish an old one. *Period*. Commit to what you start and see it through. If you aren't sure if it's something you want to do or not, no big deal, but once you decide it is and commit *finish it*. This may also mean you have to cut back on *gasp* reddit.
* **Take Care of Yourself.** - This is largely Step #0, but it also means getting enough sleep, flossing, dressing properly, financial responsibility, and yet still *having fun*.
* **Ask for Help.** - If you need to see a psychologist/psychiatrist, do it. If you need to ask for help with your wardrobe, do it. Diet/workout too confusing? Find a friend or hire someone to teach you.


**Conclusion:**

* **Self Confidence is king, and you get that by taking responsibility for your own life and your own needs.**

* **Stop trying to fill girls' needs or fix their problems.**

* **You're more attractive when you look out for yourself first.**

On the NGAF sub, the best thing you can do for yourself: stop giving a crap about the things that you can't do anything about. Realize the person sitting 5 feet away is more concerned with themselves 99% of the time than they are some random stranger, and say ""Hi'. Make their day a bit better, and in doing so make your day a lot better.

On the seduction reddit, quite a bit has been misconstrued about this sub I think. There is a large portion dedicated to simple things like conversation, inner strength, and self love. These things are not exclusive to picking up women, or pick up artists in general. They enhance your life and the way you perceive things.

I am also going to say that your first step to improvement is to shut the fuck up and listen to me. Drop what you think you know because it doesn't matter to anybody but you, a lot of what you think you know is not true outside of your head. You think too much, you over analyze everything. This is not a bad thing, you are an intelligent individual but appearantly you aren't intelligent enough to know when to stop thinking and just act. I am here for that reason.


**stop giving any fucks at all**


You care too much, you over think everything. The world is a cruel place and you will be shat on, you will fuck up and you will fall on your face many times. Don't be afraid of failure embrace it. Learn from it and adapt to it. It appears, to me, that by labeling yourself forever alone you have already embraced failure. The problem is that you have embraced it in a negative way, wallowing in it instead of learning from it. The worst you can do is fail. If you ask a girl and she says no, move on it isn't a big deal. If someone shits on you then snipe back because they deserve it, be funny with it as laughs gain friends and interest in you. At worst be caustic because they deserve it. If she ignores your advances then go straight over to her friend because that demonstrates the amount of fucks you give, which should be zero at any given time.


**Be an asshole**


Some women love this. If somebody shits on you let it bounce off because let's face it they are idiots and though you may not believe it you are better than they are. If a women turns you down then say, ""oh that's cool, I only asked you because I thought your friend was out of my league anyway."" diminish their importance to you and their general value. If they think you're not attractive then it's even more of an insult to them. Make finding a female a game of sorts, diminish their perceived value to yourself. They have to earn your respect, then they gain value. 


**Be direct, be assertive**


Make your intentions clear, be direct in what you want. Grasp at it. Especially if you are on good terms with that women you know her really well. Being direct can be your greatest asset. Most women appreciate your honesty. Compliment them, after a connection is established. No Shakespearean lines just a simple comment about her hair, dress, nails, eyes and then continue with your conversation. I guess what I mean here is to convey that you find them attractive through compliments and listening to them. Which brings me to my next point.


**Drop your bullshit at the door**


I don't give a rats ass if you don't do small talk, you think it's bullshit or whatever. If you ever want to get laid, have a relationship or even a friendship then you must engage in bullshit small talk. Also drop your emotional bullshit at the door.

**Have a drink**


If you don't drink then start. There is a point where you are not drunk but you are drunk enough to have confidence. I suggest two or three strong drinks maximum. Do not get wasted, if you can get her to drink buy her some drinks, women can be a lot friendlier once those walls are broken down. Alcohol is a good tool for socializing, for both of you, think Raj from the big bang theory. And remember not to get hammered because those who get hammered don't get to nail.


**Networking**


I don't care how much you hate small talk or detest the bastards you are surrounded by, you have to talk to them and listen to their bullshit. Mirror them and sometimes repeat parts of their speech it shows that you are on a level with them. Make connections. Men have female friends. Engage them in their bullshit and play their little games. Think Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. You don't even have to listen to them or remember their names just entertain them, get numbers invite them out and they will reciprocate.


**Recreate yourself. Lie, cheat and steal.**


Create a persona, you will feel more comfortable. Avoid any subjects that deviate from the social norm unless they are shared by the group. Examples include anime, memes or manga. Learn to bullshit. Learn the minimum about sports, cars or other common interests. Develop a silver tongue. Learn to bullshit your way through anything. Get comfortable with being the center of attention even for a short time. A lot can be learned from psychopaths and highly functioning sociopaths. The joke here is that you think I'm fucking with you.


**Be a man**


If you have feelings keep them under wraps. Appear conserved and confident even if you aren't. Western culture is rapidly being feminized, it's sad. Women appreciate a real man over a emo, dyed hair, skinny jeans and painted nails type. This isn't 100% true but it is true of the good ones. I'm talking about the mature and mentally stable ones. If you need a reference for classic manliness think Clint Eastwood. Act reserved, strong, speak with clarity and intent. 


**Get off the Internet, especially reddit**
I mean it, it will do you no good. Stay off the Internet for at least 7 hours a day or 5 not including work.


**Dress appropriately**


For most of you this will mean jeans (try Levi 501's) a shirt (nothing over the top) some trainers (adidas do some that go great with jeans eg. Sambas) In some cases a t-shirt or something similar can work well with jeans and trainers can be interchanged with boots or shoes. Whatever you do dress appropriate. Never over or under dress.


**Don't be afraid to order**


Whether alone or with company don't be afraid to order, be loud and clear so you don't have to repeat yourself. If you are at a bar and you cannot get served pulling this little stunt will impress friends and women. Know the number of the bar, dial it and say ""the guys down this end of the bar want to get served at some point"" then wave at the bartender. This brings me to two other points.


**How you carry yourself**

This is all about appearing confident, calm, collective, assertive and having a prescence in a room. You can't get away with a stunt like the one above without knowing how to carry yourself. Be firm with your words but calm, look people in the eye when talking. Have a stern expression when dealing with service industry staff so they know that they are going to serve you whether they want to or not.


**Be in control**


Be it a conversation or an a date make sure you control the situation, through leading conversation or choosing the venue ect. If you are in control then you have no reason to be uncomfortable and awkward. If you do not control the situation then gain control by steering attention towards yourself, get comfortable with being in the limelight. An example of steering conversation is by making an unpopular opinion about something known. For example by saying that you don't think X deserved an Oscar or a sporting award. Or you do not think X popular band is good. You could also make a statement that everyone agrees with like ""jersey shore is terrible a snooki is a nasty whore."" In a situation where you disagree or state a negative/ unpopular opinion be prepared and know your shit. Another thing, when you are thinking of asking a girl on a date do not ask where she wants to go or if she wants to go to X. You say that you are going to X and ask her if she wants to come with. It adds some ""I don't give a fuck"" factor and she will be more likely to oblige. The last thing is that you shouldn't contact her too often, especially during dating. A 3 times a week max. One is a how are you and two are asking if she wants to accompany you to X on Xday at Xpm.


**Emotions**


Never spill your emotions to a girl from the offset, I fucked up this way many times before I learned my lesson. Even later on don't spill your emotions. Only hint at them later on in the game. Finally spill your emotions when she does it first. Reciprocate emotional spillage never initiate it. Keep your emotions guarded and you won't get hurt as badly If you fuck up or it doesn't work out.


**Research**


Treat potential dates as targets, do your research. Put those Internet stalking skills to good use. Find out her likes and dislikes. Obviously you don't tell her how you know, you just know. She'll appreciate how you just know her. Her favorite foods, music and such but nothing too personal.


**fake it till you make it**


Even if these things are natural if you fake them for long enough they will become second nature and you will have changed yourself. However do not lose that spark, your intelligence. You don't have to sell your soul to get laid. I'm not saying to stop doing what you love just keep it private.

1335705738.0,0,self.faimprovement,sy44v,[x-post] The 31 Day Relationship Project - why you should do it,dhc23,3,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/sy44v/xpost_the_31_day_relationship_project_why_you/,"I'm a mod at [/r/group_help_dating](/r/group_help_dating) and we're starting a 31 Day Relationship project on the 1st May. All are welcome and you can work on any aspect of relationships you want. Here's my pitch why you should do it.

It might not be possible say that relationships are the most important thing in life but life's definitely better when they're good. Good relationships support us, comfort us and challenge us to be our best. They lift and inspire, they bring nurture and reward. Some of us who have difficulty with them claim we don't need them, that we're alright - even better - on our own. But it's not true.

Without good relationships life is harder and poorer. As the Swedish proverb goes ""Shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow half a sorrow"". When our relationships aren't working we struggle more, achieve less and are more or less miserable throughout.

It takes effort to make a relationship good. We don't have to change to make someone love us, but we can't be selfish either. To share is to give and giving ain't easy, at least not all of the time. To share is also to receive and for some of us that's even more difficult. 

They're called relationship skills, not gifts, because they're developed through knowledge, experience and most of all, practice. This project is intended to help you practice the skills you want to learn, whilst benefiting from the knowledge and experience of others who are either going through the process or mentoring you along the way.

Thirty minutes practice a day might not sound like a lot, but when was the last time you spent 15 hours in one month focused on learning this skill? Moreover, when did you do this alongside others who could inspire, console or help solve the problems you face?

Ours is a dating subreddit but the problems we encounter in romantic relationships are most probably played out in other areas too. So if you want to work on loving relationships, great, but feel free to work on any aspect of relationships you like, be that work, friends or family.

Don't have a goal in mind? Don't worry the group can help with that. All you need is the desire to find the time and the willingness to do the work. There can be no promises about what result you'll get but it's very likely something will happen and besides, what do you have to lose?",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_sy44v,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/sy44v/xpost_the_31_day_relationship_project_why_you/,
1335187824.0,0,self.faimprovement,so4fi,[x-post from dating_advice] 31 Day Reddit Relationship Workshop,dhc23,5,5,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/so4fi/xpost_from_dating_advice_31_day_reddit/,"I'm a mod at /r/group_help_dating, a project which aims to help people overcome their difficulties finding a relationship. I've posted before looking for mentors, I'm here now to introduce a workshop we'll be running in May and to invite you to take part in it. I hope that's okay.

The idea is that for the month of May we spend 30 minutes each day working on an aspect of our relationships. It might be that you want to start a relationship or to become better at the one you're already in. The goal you choose is entirely up to you. All you need do is commit to working on it for 30 minutes a day, and to checking in at least once weekly to let the rest of the group know how you're getting on.

You might think that there's not much you can achieve with only 30 minutes effort but I assure you, the results can be significant. It doesn't take much regular, focused effort to make a difference, but if you feel particularly stuck the proof that change is happening can be just the kick you need to get you going. There's also something very empowering about making a commitment to yourself and to others. And then delivering on it. 

Workshop is actually a bit of a grand name because no-one will be leading it. As the name of our subreddit suggests, we're into group help - specifically peer help. We'll set our goals together, will answer each other's questions and cheer each other on. There's no practical limit on the number of people who can take part, in fact the more of us there are the greater the group dynamic will be. 

So if you do feel stuck, if you do want to supercharge your relationship efforts and take a large step forward [come join us](/r/group_help_dating). ",,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,t3_so4fi,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/so4fi/xpost_from_dating_advice_31_day_reddit/,
