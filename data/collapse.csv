1338809471.0,622,self.collapse,uk1ug,"So, I'm unsubscribing...",,808,186,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/uk1ug/so_im_unsubscribing/,"I originally joined this subreddit because of my interest in figuring out solutions to world crisis.  It says right there in the description of this subreddit: ""How will we survive? Any ideas?""

According to the sidebar this subreddit is to discuss things like peak oil, sustainability, health, infrastructure, recycling, and scavenging.  All I've been seeing from this subreddit are hysterical posts from mostly questionable sources which seem to imply that everyone on here is some kind of chicken little screaming about how the sky is falling.

I know that the majority of you are probably going to say that I just don't get it and that I'll be sorry that I didn't heed your warning signs but, honestly, I just don't give a shit.  Even if the collapse happened tomorrow, I would be 500 times better off than you because instead of spending all my time scouring the internet looking for proof that people are suffering, I actually make connections within my community, grow plants, and use renewable energy.  

The problems that I've started having with this subreddit are the same ones I always end up having with communities that are focused on collapse.  At some point every time you see someone else in the world who is suffering in some way you don't react with compassion but, instead, you use it as some sign that things really are going to happen the way you insisted they would all along.  Being smug isn't the best way to react to the world.  Desperately seeking out articles that support your world view isn't the best way to spend your time if you really believe that a collapse is coming.  

To the mods: I suggest that you start enforcing some rules or that you change the subreddit sidebar to reflect what /r/collapse is really about that way you won't have to deal with people unsubscribing because they are tired of seeing every conspiracy theory under the sun appearing in their newsfeed.",,False,,t5_2qhw9,False,,,True,t3_uk1ug,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/uk1ug/so_im_unsubscribing/,

It hit me last summer with all the debt ceiling hoopla that an economic collapse is more than possible, it's a matter of when and how fast. 

Yet I don't like to think about it too much because the horrific scenarios that would involve real human beings seems like too much to ponder. Literally, whenever I think about a collapse I get in a serious funk and I feel like weeping when I think of my children or anybody's children having to experience it. Then there's the uncertainty... will it happen it a horrific way... can we get through it? Will civilization be lost? 

I have to be honest, my first thoughts are not ""Get a gun and hide somewhere""... I would rather die trying to help than live some self-centered existence in a hole somewhere. That's why it's hard to read this subreddit. Maybe there needs to be a ""Pre-Collapse Freakout"" subreddit for people like me. You all are further along in the process of acceptance.

I guess the question I want to ask is this: what was it like when you first began to entertain the idea that a collapse was immanent? Did you go through a mourning or grieving period? 

Am I taking it too seriously? I read a comment the other day saying ""You will hear the cries of your children's hunger pains..."" You know? There seems to be a lot of inhuman things said so callously here... making me wonder if anyone else feels the implications of this disaster or if this whole thing is like an RPG and I'm taking it too seriously.

I'll stop rambling... thoughts? Anyone relate?

It's a pretty damn simple concept.  If you burn one barrel of oil getting a barrel of oil out of the ground, your EROEI is 1:1.  That's completely worthless.  A hundred years ago, when oil was spewing out of the ground in Pennsylvania and Texas, we were looking at an EROEI of about 100:1.  For every 1 unit of energy put into drilling for oil, we were getting back 100 times that energy.  That's basically free energy.

Right now, the best oil wells in the world are about 10:1.  We use the equivalent of 1 barrel of oil to get 10 out of the ground.  Alternative oil sources, like deepwater drilling, fracking, tar sand mining, are about 3 or 4:1.  Not that great, but still worth it when oil is selling for over $100 a barrel.

The reason nuclear power never took over the world is this: when you factor in the costs of mining the radioactive materials, building power plants, building power lines to cities hundreds of miles away, safely disposing of the waste products, etc. then you're really getting something like 2:1 or 3:1.  Not that great at all.

[Look at this ridiculous article](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/137520-clean-limitless-fusion-power-could-arrive-sooner-than-expected) about how fusion powerplants could be possible in 15 years.  It is sitting [over 900 upvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/116jxi/clean_limitless_fusion_power_could_arrive_sooner/) on /r/science.    

""Through various optimizations, the researchers discovered a MagLIF setup that almost breaks even (i.e. it almost produces more thermal energy than the electrical energy required to begin the fusion reaction).""

These people are excited about a breakthrough that makes fusion ALMOST produce as much energy as it uses!  And they are calling that ""breakthrough"" evidence that ""clean, limitless"" energy is around the corner!  That's just silly.  For it to be anything like a replacement for coal and oil, it would have to be generating at least 10:1 EROEI, but realistically we need something closer to 20:1 or 30:1 to get us out of the current energy crunch.  Wind doesn't give us that.  Solar doesn't give us that.  There's no energy source in the world that gives us scaleable energy as cheaply as oil, and until there is, Peak Oil is very real.

EDIT:  [Here's the article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/exclusive-pioneering-scientists-turn-fresh-air-into-petrol-in-massive-boost-in-fight-against-energy-crisis-8217382.html) I was originally commenting on.  And here's why it's bullshit: 

&gt;Although the process is still in the early developmental stages and needs to take electricity from the national grid to work, the company believes it will eventually be possible to use power from renewable sources such as wind farms or tidal barrages.

They have figured out how to turn air and carbon dioxide into liquid fuel.  That's interesting.  But the fact that they ADMIT it will require power from the electric grid means that it's not actually generating energy.  It's just using one kind of energy (electricity) to produce a fuel that can later be burned.  Oil isn't amazing because it's a liquid fuel.  It's amazing because it gives us 10 times more energy than we burn in getting it out of the ground!",,False,,t5_2qhw9,1350666795.0,,,True,t3_11r6w1,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/11r6w1/no_peak_oil_has_not_been_solved/,

That's like paying the mortgage on a fairly nice house where we live. So far, paying the bills has been tight but doable, but we've certainly had to cut back in other areas. Scraping by as we've done makes me wonder how we managed to waste so much money before I was reduced to part-time status. I'm sure some of it was due to too many Five Hour Energy drinks, too many meals at Mi Finca, too many evenings spent drinking three dollar beers and five dollar shots, and too many times when it was easier to run by Dairy Queen than to expend the time and energy to cook something at home. One way or the other, we're forced to find strategies to cope with having less money until we find news ways to get paid.

When you're living from paycheck to paycheck (and as far as food and fuel goes we definitely are) there comes a moment in every interim between paychecks where you figure out that you're broke. Sometimes it's the day before payday, and sometimes it's the day after payday, which is not at all a good thing. You realize that however much money you have is already accounted for and there's no wiggle room for anything else. You can't eat anything that isn't provided by someone else or already in your house. You can't go anywhere not completely necessary. You sure can't buy anything for which you haven't already set money aside. Life becomes, from that moment of realization that you're broke until the next payday, a matter of living on what resources you've already got - and no more.

At first I didn't understand how much these realizations that I was broke were affecting my mood. I thought, ""I'll just have to cut back and I'll make it fine. It isn't like there's no food in the pantry or the lights are going to be shut off. I'll just have to stay here and entertain myself. I'm just spoiled if I find that difficult."" I was a little annoyed with the number meals that consisted of bologna sandwiches or ramen or macaroni and cheese, and how many times I had to decline an invitation to come out with friends, but I was holding up pretty well.

It took a very small reversal of fortune to really point out to me how unhappy I was when I couldn't leave the house. I started tutoring and got paid in cash. The last time that I got paid in cash was the day after I realized I was broke. I went from having two dollars in my pocket to having twenty-two dollars in my pocket. Now twenty-two dollars doesn't sound like a lot to most people, but it really is. Twenty dollars can be spent in a myriad of ways to help improve your station in life. It's the difference between having Diet Pepsi to drink with supper or not. It's the difference between having an extra loaf of bread around the house. It's the difference between eating a meal out with friends and having to tell them you already ate or that you'll eat at home today. It's the difference as the week winds down of having to worry about having the gas to make it back to the filling station after you get paid or not. In short, that extra twenty dollars was empowering! I felt like I had a new lease on life! It was only in the excitement of having funds to cover my most basic needs that I realized how helpless I felt with empty pockets. My depression lifted and I was ready for the trying days ahead with renewed hope.

Then my wife took it out of my pocket while I was in the shower.

I'm a regular on this subreddit and wanted to share a post that might be different from the usual stuff. I'm sure you will agree that the posts on here can get pretty heavy-going and depressing - after all, the subject-matter isn't exactly promising seeing as where things are headed. 

So…I wanted to share something with you that I've just written. It's my second novel and I've only just got it done and released. For the next couple of days, it's free on the Amazon Kindle store. The recurring theme and setup of the novel is about an economic collapse in the US, which I thought might interest some of you. I'd love to know what you think about my scenario. I'll write the synopsis below, and for anyone who's a reader of novels and would like to grab it, it's on the house with my compliments.

[Pump on the Amazon Kindle Store](http://www.amazon.com/Pump-ebook/dp/B007F2VE42/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331198005&amp;sr=1-1)

Synopsis:

In the not-too-distant future, after a catastrophic and world-wide economic collapse, the United States is a broken shell of its former self. 

But on the island of Manhattan, a comfortable standard of living still exists that only the world’s richest can afford. Sheltered from the chaos and anarchy of the outside world, New York City has become a privately-run sanctuary operated by a mysterious and powerful company named Maddox Corporation.

As one of the world’s last remaining and fully functioning cities, Manhattan requires ongoing human resources for its daily operations, and to provide the luxurious services that wealthy clients still demand. To recruit workers for the island, Maddox runs a lottery program, which offers its winners the chance to escape what is now a brutal and desperate existence in the real world, and instead begin a privileged life in the safety and comfort of a city that most will only ever dream about again.

But, of course, there is a catch. There is always a catch.


TL;DR - I've written a novel based on collapse and it's free for a few days on the Amazon Kindle Store.


EDIT: Based on a number of people interested in reading my novel but not having a Kindle, I've made it available as a PDF to grab from here. I won't leave the file up indefinitely, so grab it when you can. Thanks for the interest!

____
r/Collapse, 
____
/r/Futurology would like to challenge the /r/Collapse community to a casual debate. The topic will be, if you choose to participate, the **future of the human species**. /r/Collapse, naturally, will defend the pessimistic view, and consequently, /r/Futurology will advance the optimistic one. There are near infinite arguments for each side, and I am curious to see *which are more convincing*.

Subscribers, moderators, and anybody is welcome to participate. Our current proposal for the rules of the debate can be as follows;
___

A 90 minute debate. 9 subreddits volunteer one moderator each to form '9 representatives' not unlike the US supreme court. Each subreddit, through their Judge/Representative, gets to ask a different question on the predetermined topic [**the future of the human species**] as well as determine judgement on both the debater's arguments from r/Futurology and r/Collapse. Winning the majority [5-4] of the arguments, as determined by the 9 judges, determines our winner.

10 minutes for responses each so we don't end up sifting through statistics or just reading research. 3 representatives from the Futurology community and 3 representatives from the Collapse community (can be outside advisers, subscribers, or moderators) complete 9 questions in a 90 minute period from 9 different subreddits in 10 minute intervals, ultimately moderated by 1 randomly chosen individual  [wildcard, preferably from r/debate] who collects and assembles all openings, rebuttals, responses, and 2nd rebuttals in a giant self-post, on r/debate.
___
9 subreddit Judges:

i) Economy

ii) Energy

iii) Science

iv) Nature

v) Space

vi) Politics

vii) Environment

viii) Technology

ix) Askreddit

1338903410.0,83,self.collapse,um1fh,Let's have a different discussion about economic collapse.,MahoneyRed,105,22,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/um1fh/lets_have_a_different_discussion_about_economic/,"I know this will get downvoted to oblivion and argued away, but I think it's time to bring up some more realistic views on the economic scene.

**People are forgetting the Human variable**

In the grand scheme of things I believe a complete economic collapse of society is highly unlikely. I have a few reasons for this:

*The people with the wealth want to stay that way.* All the rich and wealthy out there are making their money on the backs of the every day worker and laborer. They know full well the implication of letting the economy collapse; they no longer have any power or wealth. If money becomes useless, then they are useless. So they will do whatever it takes to keep it that way.

*The majority of people can't be bothered with it.* We all know people who look at the economic scene and expect someone to fix it. Or they think they can elect one person into political office that will somehow magically fix everything. These are the people that will accept whatever happens in the economy so long as they have their iTunes, Beiber, and celebrity gossip.

And even when people can't just go to the store because they are out of work, they will expect the government to to save them. Because that's what the government does, right? Part of our paychecks go to helping everyone else, why not you and I when we need it?

And if you think it will get worse than that, see the point above. The people with the wealth want wealth.

**But my argument has holes**

Yes, it does. Look at the current situation in Greece. People are rioting and returning to bartering, creating their own currencies in some cases. People out there are living an economic collapse. While this is true let's note some key things: *They're not forming roving gangs of marauders. There is no open rebellion happening. Law and society has not crumbled.*

But what if we look to the past, like the fall of Rome or the Persian Empires? Yes the economic burden certainly played a part in their downfall, but the times have changed drastically. Were a modern civilization, or in this case entire economic zone, to crumble it would be a global one.

Our communication and business is so entirely intertwined now that we are literally all leaning on one another. And because of this, I will send you back to my two previous points: *The wealthy want to stay wealthy, and the general populace does not want a collapse.*

Now, I'm not saying a collapse of the economic system to dooms day proportions is impossible, but I do feel it is highly unlikely. Things are certain to get bad, but rather than talk about how messed the euro is, why don't people here put their collective thoughts together on how to better respond to this crisis.

It angers me that humans have destroyed this earth. More species will go extinct in the first half of this century, that in the previous 65 million years (forgot source). I hate that wonderful cultures are oppressed or exterminated. The Native Americans knew how to live off the land and they had a strong sense of community. But the Europeans gave them smallpox blankets so they could exploit the resources of the New World. Users of psychedelics are arrested and imprisoned because they posed a threat to war and consumerism. 

I feel like I have woken up from the Matrix and billions of other people are still dreaming. Hypnotized by the television, computer, cell phones, and cheap oil. Believing the lies that society tells them. We are making progress. People are slowly waking up, but it's going to take a major event to wake up a majority of people. When the storms his South, people praised god for keeping them alive, while still denying climate change.

I am glad that oil is running out and governments will lose control. The population will plummet and people will focus on what really matters. We have abused the Earth and each other, and now we will pay the price. 

TL;DR I am glad the collapse is coming. I think the world will be a better place afterwards. I hope we finally get our shit together and respect human rights.

**EDIT**: Wow, I really got down-voted like crazy here. I guess people think I'm cynical, naive, and angry, and I am. I just feel like I got the short end of the societal stick. This society is so ruthless. If one is not born with certain advantages, then life is a lot harder. Many people are born with disadvantages that many people are very unsympathetic about. I know it could be worse. I could have been born as a starving African (no offence). I've been an outcast (or weird) all my life. As a kid, my peers thought I was funny, but once puberty hit, my peers hated me and I felt like few adults even cared. People want you to behave and not be hyper-active or gay or atheist. After a while society wore me down to the point where I have embodied the counter-culture and become very anti-social. I piss people off just by being myself, and I've kinda ran with it. Trying to fit in feels fake to me. 

This was more of a rant about my disdain for this society and the way Mother Earth has been destroyed in the name of profit, and children abused in the name of religion, than a hope for billions of people to suffer a long, slow death. I should have chosen my words more carefully. Sorry for offending some of you, but I appreciate the people who gave good advice and comments. And you're right; If I could barely survive middle school, there's no way I could survive a collapse.",,False,,t5_2qhw9,True,,,True,t3_h9coa,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/h9coa/is_it_messed_up_that_i_am_excited_for_the/,

There is this horribly flawed notion among the prepperazi that if you have a well-stocked larder you can somehow drag the past into a vastly changed future and make it work.  This is folly.  Under the best-case scenario you delay your demise a year or two while you gnaw on the last of your Spam cans.  Under the worst-case scenario you've merely made yourself a whopping target for anyone with a few bullets and a lot of hunger.

The only reasonable approach for true believers is to collapse now and avoid the rush later.  Buy some land.  Learn to grow food.  (Devilishy difficult if you've never done it before, and the amount of beneficial experience is controlled by seasonal timing, not your own timing.)  Become energy independent.  Develop an unlimited source of clean water.  Learn the basics of self-defense and practice these skills.  

I'd take a three-acre organic farm, a well, some solar panels, and a good AR-15 over all the 'preps' and firearms now uselessly decorating the hidey holes of America.  And, if you farm you get to live like a free person and immediately enjoy the fruits (literally in this case) of your labors.  There is a practicality to it that reveals the flawed thinking by all this useless caching and tactical gear fetishism that seems to have a strangle grip on the throats of Prepper America.

The problem: ever more limited sources of uncorrupted data...",Chadillac19,95,22,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/q8gtw/proof_of_us_greater_depression_it_has_become/,"It has become increasingly difficult to engage in credible economic analysis, especially with respect to the U.S. economy. The problem: ever more limited sources of uncorrupted data, while the farcical “official statistics” have long since been totally divorced from the real world.

Fortunately we have been presented with some raw, uncorrupted data which demonstrates in conclusive terms that the U.S. economy is literally shriveling before our eyes: a 21st century economy with plummeting energy consumption, and even a declining use of electricity.

As I was sifting through all of Bloomberg’s propaganda on the latest U.S. trade numbers (and trying to latch onto a few facts), I came across one very peculiar passage:

…American companies also bought more consumer household items, automobiles and parts, and crude oil from overseas.

Exports increased 0.7 percent to $178.8 billion, boosted by record sales of petroleum to buyers overseas. That caused the trade gap excluding petroleum to widen even more than the deficit overall…

The great U.S. economy, the largest oil-glutton in the history of humanity (by several multiples) is now a “net energy exporter”. How can this be possible? The U.S. economy has contracted so severely (already) that the only way that U.S. refineries can sell all the petroleum products they produce is to sell them to the growing economies of “emerging market” nations.

Reflecting the broad-based collapse of the U.S. economy, these refineries are now exporting all categories of petroleum products: diesel, jet fuel, and even gasoline are now being exported in large quantities, month-after-month by U.S. refineries. Recall that it was only four, short years ago that many American politicians were alarmed by the crisis of the “lack of U.S. refining capacity”. No new refineries have been constructed in the U.S. in more than 30 years, and at that time those refineries were straining to meet the demand of solely the U.S. domestic market. With that domestic market collapsing, these refineries are now straining to find enough foreign buyers to unload all of their inventories.

[Chart: U.S. petroleum imports/exports chart](http://bullionbullscanada.com/images/stories/usoilimportsexports.jpg)

Given these facts alone, it is utterly absurd for the U.S. government to pretend that the U.S. economy is growing. Note that the government claims that most of this growth is occurring in agriculture and manufacturing – both very energy-intensive industries. There’s no doubt that the energy-intensive agriculture sector is thriving, a result of a growing global “appetite” and Wall Street-induced shortages in most commodities. So with the large U.S. agriculture sector gobbling up more energy than ever, what does that say about the rest of the (decaying) U.S. economy?

Let us not forget that the U.S. population continues to grow. More people using much, much, less energy; and this is called a “growing economy”? Absurd. Even more absurd, this steadily growing population has been using much less electricity, going back to around 2007.

Mark Lundeen provided a very detailed analysis of the consumption of U.S. electricity in a recent commentary. It shows U.S. electrical consumption peaking in approximately 2006, and then beginning a distinct decline starting in 2007. Yes, power demand has “bounced back” somewhat from the worst of the collapse – but at levels still more than 3% lower than in 2007. Put another way, the supposed “U.S. economic recovery” has only resulted in roughly half of that lost demand being restored.

I don't think i'll actually do it, but these thoughts of ending my life do flash across my mind quite often. I am quite certain it is because of the paranoia. I mean, people are being bombed, killed, starving, being stoned to death, etc RIGHT NOW. We are still making bullets,bombs, tanks, war material etc. We are collapsing, we are insane, and I do not wish to suffer in this insane world any more.

EDIT: Yes I am depressed. Just to be clear, I don't have kids, I am the middle child of a family of 5. My brother died of cancer last year at the age of 30. I thought I would get over it, but clearly it is manifesting in these thoughts.Thank you so much for the words of encouragement.

And as the inevitable chaostrophe approaches, people look for metaphors and answers. Every time a culture gets into trouble, it casts itself back into the past looking for the last sane moment it ever knew. And the last sane moment we ever knew was on the plains of Africa, 15,000 years ago, rocked in cradle of the great horned mushroom goddess before history. Before standing armies, before slavery and property, before warfare and phonetic alphabets and monotheism. Before, before, before. And this is where the future is taking us. Because the secret faith of the 20th century is not modernism. The secret faith of the 20th century is nostalgia for the archaic, nostalgia for the Paleolithic, and that gives us body piercing, abstract expressionism, surrealism, jazz, rock and roll, and Catastrophe Theory. The 20th century mind is nostalgic for the paradise that once existed on the mushroom-dotted plains of Africa, where the plant-human symbiosis occurred that pulled us out of the animal body and into the tool-using, culture-making, imagination-exploring creature that we are.

And why does this matter? It matters because it shows that the way out is back, and that the future is a forward escape into the past. This is what the psychedelic experience means. It's a doorway out of history and into the wiring under the board in eternity. And I tell you this because if the community understands what it is that holds it together, the community will be better able to streamline itself for flight into hyperspace. Because what we need is a new myth. What we need is a new true story that tells us where were going in the universe. And that true story is that the ego is a product of pathology and that when psilocybin is regularly part of the human experience, the ego is suppressed. And the suppression of the ego means the defeat of the dominators, the materialists, the product peddlers. Psychedelics return us to the inner worth of the self, to the importance of feeling immediate experience. And nobody can sell that to you and nobody can buy it from you, so the dominator culture is not interested in the felt presence of immediate experience. But that's what holds the community together. And as we break out of the silly myths of science and the infantile obsessions of the marketplace, what we discover through the psychedelic experience is that in the body -- in the body -- there are Niagaras of beauty, alien beauty, alien dimensions that are part of the self, the richest part of life."" -Terrence McKenna. http://www.lycaeum.org/~sputnik/McKenna/Evolution/theory.html",,False,,t5_2qhw9,False,,,True,t3_dq6i9,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dq6i9/i_want_to_share_a_quote_from_one_of_the_greatest/,

I currently sail as a vessels third officer for a major shipping company. What i've learned so far is that going to sea and being in a self sufficient WROL situation have many parallels. When your at sea you and your crew are more or less everything from the ships navigator to the plumber, fireman, police department, doctor and anything else in between not to mention your making your own water and electricity. Shipboard life offers a lot of opportunity to hone practical and technical skills that one day may prove useful in a wrol situation.


Emergencies: 
In this modern-age of electronics and global communications todays ships benefit from multiple ways of being able to call for help when disaster strikes. While help almost always arrives it sometimes will not arrive for hours or even days and by that point the help may come too late. 

Two things iv'e noticed that often separate success from disaster at sea is training and drills. I believe this to be the case with prepping as well. When possible try and do drills with your family going through numerous things such as first aid related topics well as contingencies in the event of a house fire, roof collapse, or home invasion. Try and hold them regularly perhaps once every 2 months or once a month. 

Depending on the ship and company we usually have a minimum of 2 drills a month consisting of fire/emergency drills as well as boat drills. 
The drills often start with breaking out the firefighting gear and carrying out mock search and rescue, firefighting procedures as well as exercises in damage control and shoring up bulkheads and hatches. You may want to put a plan in place for similar type stuff. Just remember to keep it as simple as possible and as practical as possible. 

Often the ships medical officer will run mock triage as well as go through the procedures with crew that are not immediately engaged with the drill at hand. This could include going over basic first aid CPR or AED training. the prepping counterpart to this is generally the same. 

Eventually the drill escalates to abandonment of the vessel (worst case scenario) (The prepping counterpart of this would be a mock bug out) it is essential to muster the ships crew with their immersion suits and bug out bags, (yes the crew on my ship pack small bug out bags incase of abandonment)

I would recommend that you too hold a mock bug out for your family at least twice a year. 

CBRN preparedness at sea and in Prepping. In the prepping world, this isn't something that everyone does or puts priority on. This is often because the cost and availability of proper gear and pharmaceuticals for agents. Additionally you may not feel as though the threat is very high and may wish to prep on other things. Thats completely fine and totally up to your discretion. 

If you were interested in small steps you can take here are some tips. At sea we preach time, distance, shelter.  Granted the ship has the luxury of sailing away from an effected area but the concept is the same (limit your time of exposure, distance from the event, seek deep shelter)

One thing we do aboard ship that can be done at home is rigging a chemical wash down system. This is very useful in decontaminating decks from chemical residue and even radiological fallout. Granted we do this on steel decks so your results may vary but its something to keep in mind. 

Some ships wash down systems are more elaborate than others, but honestly if you have an in-ground sprinkler system you can run it or even use a pre staged garden hose with holes punched into it. and run it if easily and safely accessible during or just prior to an event.

(I'm currently taking a class on Shipboard CBRD which includes a lot of good info including plotting fallout and decontamination and what not. If your interested shoot me a PM and ill see what i can disseminate once my class is concluded )

Security: 
Some areas of the ocean are straight up indian territory, the threats of piracy and terrorism are quite real. Quite often my ship sails through areas that are experiencing WROL and civil unrest right now, so Well maintained watches are a must! Depending on the threat you may choose to run your watches covertly or overtly, you'll have to decide on your own. For example going through pirate waters in daylight we often try to be very visible often with an armed deck watch. This is often a big enough deterrence to send pirates in the other direction upon seeing an alert and armed crew. At night however we may choose to run dark and fast slipping through unnoticed, becoming visible when attacked.

You can apply the same concept, in the day time you may choose to have a visible show of force and at night you may choose to be more subdued and look like an unworthy target. 

If your not comfortable with firearms get comfortable with them, they are often your best defense when left with no other option. Also you can get creative, iv'e heard of some ships hooking up car batteries to their hand rails so when the pirates attempt to board they are met with an electric shock. I personally wouldn't do this for obvious reasons, but thinking outside of the box in a must. All in all vigilance and a well maintained and competent watch is paramount. Additionally it might be wise to keep a log book for the watch to note any thing of interest i/e maintenance/house keeping issues or security issues whether it be armed contact or noticing that someone in the neighborhood doesn't belong and is casing houses.  

Accounting:
The last thing i want to talk about is the accounting aspect of prepping. Its often overlooked and i'm not sure how many of us actually do it but it is an important aspect of being a prepper.

At sea we keep log books for everything from the last time we had a boat drill, tested the fire suppression system, as well as logs for the watches, stores, maintenance and so on. 

You can also keep logs for medical supplies, food stores, fuel, ammo, general supplies and maintenance, this will ensure your fully stocked within acceptable expiration dates and have equipment in working order.

Log books also help with accountability with your survival party or in my case ships crew. It insures that all personnel are doing what their supposed to be doing and a system of oversight is installed. safety and survival depend on it. 

(Anyone interested in how to keep a proper log pm me and ill put up a post on that soup to nuts)

1370795221.0,65,self.collapse,1fzjfn,Here's whats going on... (xpost from political discussion),,95,30,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1fzjfn/heres_whats_going_on_xpost_from_political/,"I really hope that people read this so they can get a bottom-line perspective on what is going on right now. Sorry if my english is a bit verbose but its not my primary language, I'll edit as needed so it is easier to read as well.

Basically all of our problems (social, political, psychological, physical and international) today start with the lack of sensibility, morality and sustainability in our practices and thus we cannot meet our potential as human beings through civilization. The real sickness is consumer culture because it is keeping people narrow-minded, placated and obedient so they can keep consuming things they don’t need with money that they barely have. It is materialism at its worse but it is also undoing itself and tearing through the social/political fabric in a debt-austerity-totalitarian spiral. 

This excessive materialism has come into existence through a form of manipulation by our leaders and because the majority of the public refuses to question it and apply the simple truths. Before discussing any of this though, it is really important to state what our goal is meant to be, the point of human life within the context of civilization would not be to consume blindly into a quick oblivion but to express our potential through acts of morality in connection to everything for sustaining, to avoid and defuse distressing situations through moral intelligence and be aware of the complex universe through peaceful self-reflection and exercises while attaining self realization through your own actions. In extension, here are similar idealistic things that would serve as a cornerstone of our civilization: finding a cure for or preventing cancer, fixing roads and bridges, having communities of healthy populations with increasing longevity through preventative medicine, green energy with no pollution and a sustainable economy that provides liquid exchanges for all human needs to avoid starvation, despair and houselessness; but the truth is that none of these are things are being realized in our society or have begun to be realized because the centralized power structure fails to adhere to any moral edifice of sustainability, stability and community thus it continues to ignore the public, morals, the state of its country, culture and its landscape. The leaders in their arrogance have been abusing stability all around the world for a long time now for short term gain and political control. In reaction, the majority of the public refuses to question and be awakened to this so they have been placated or suppressed under mass conditioning.

To illustrate my points further about sensibility, sustainability and subversion, here are some videos that you can see for your own benefit: 1.) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViI6uAxqEOY (Pyramids of Waste) AKA The lightbulb conspiracy. 2.) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aVur0_hwyE&amp;list=PLF5863E552BBF1AC3 Ex-KGB defector Yuri Bezemov spells out the political game of manipulation, dis-information and deception.

The bottom line here is that Controlled obsolescence and controlled obedience has been the dominant theme for a long time through various political, social and scientific venues. The government, its entities, big businesses, some parts of the public and the majority of our leaders are not interested in curing cancer, encouraging morality, enforcing justice, healthy individuality through questioning, practicing sovereignty and sustainability; instead they have incentivized the opposite: expensive prescription medications, oligarchic mergers, massive surveillance systems, intimidation/control techniques, poverty through debt, inhumane systems of warfare upon civilians-domestic or international, speculative trading, social Darwinism, role models that have shunned questioning and learning, the casual practice of irony has been encourage while ignoring serious and relevant topics through media, glamorizing a nearsighted form of materialistic intelligence and vanity through comedy or arrogance on television. Basically at the very heart of it, they have favored materialistic indoctrination to commodify everything and then favor competition amongst the public so the privileged can continue benefiting off the spoils. The public of-course have not questioned or awoken to these facts even though they have been challenged and reminded of many times and in many different pieces.

Now all of my points were not to make you angry because it is important to remain lucid, but everything stated above has happened and it has also been reinforced through subversion, control and passivity. Entire countries, governments, language, environment, food supplies, indigenous cultures and the people have ultimately been misled and their minds corrupted- it has happened slowly, surely and surreptitiously. In retrospect, our leaders have made the tremendous mistake of not standing for the immaterial or the benevolent as common wisdom would dictate leadership roles to adhere. Lets take a look at some good leaders for a second: Martin Luther King, Lincoln, Ashoka, George Washington, JFK, Gautama Siddhartha or Gandhi, what were their basis as leaders? Certainly they were not perfect but what were their achievements? 
Now let’s take a practical look at our current leaders that are in power or just have stepped out not too long ago, what is/was their basis?..... and their achievements?

..... That is why things are the way they are now and things will keep deteriorating under our system of valueless governance and materialistic addiction. If any future generation ever hopes to learn from our mistakes, then the disease (as it has always been) is excessive materialism and the resulting confusion, isolation and deterioration that results from it. At first it occurs by experiment, then design, eventually it becomes self-inflicted and then onto the world to repeat across generations unless it is stopped by the same primordial moral and immaterial spiritual force.

We are all connected in this and we will have to participate in making things better again for ourselves and each other, whether now or after the crisis. Nothing is going to go unrecognized and everyone is going to be held accountable in some way, shape or form. Remember this, there is nothing more important. 

Here is the wake up point then- that our actions (stemming from our arrogance) have put the whole planet at risk and that we are headed towards extinction. The positive however, is that under the pretext of all these different converging crises, consciousness and innate human awareness is on the rise because the people are being pushed so hard that they are re-discovering their roots, their ideals and maybe even what they were suppose to stand for in the first place. It is a great thing to learn of our real identity in desperation and abandon the fake relative masks imposed on us by others with an artificial ideology stemming from excess comfort. I also want to share some simple solution here: find and stand for your values and morals! Don't stop believing in them, don't stop questioning the current state of things and keep struggling to overcome. The evil that has perpetuated will definitely undo itself because of its unsustainability but for all individuals that want to participate in good consciousness to undo this evil, then it is pretty simple: stand for your innate values and just practice them ever so slightly daily even in the current state of things. This way there is still no need for violence, extremism or anger; just the opposite is needed right now: perspective, peace and perseverance in the face of evil, corruption and injustice.

It needs to be said that the best revolutions would start internally and then spread like wildfire without even a single shot this would be the highest form of organization and human consciousness. The worst revolutions are the ones that would involve rape of women, violence among men, the torturing of both to leave orphans on the field and then continue the same chain of hatred as done before. So please choose wisely and tread carefully during these delicate times.

My post might be down-voted, buried, unread etc. but I wanted to try and do my part for as long as I'm here and share my perspective. We STILL do have the internet and I wish you all good luck during these crazy times and hopefully everyone will find the help they deserve. Just remember, that something immaterial is always needed to keep society moving along. Good values, spirituality, ethics etc. are not material things so please share this post if needed. I'm not claiming to own this piece of writing; intelligence is never meant to be privatized so spread it around and claim it as your own if needed! 

TLDR: All of our problems begin because of a lack of sensibility, morality and sustainability in practice. Without the moral edifice of immateriality and spirituality, we are not able to meet our potential as human beings in civilization because of the innate hinderenace presented by materialism. It is like being bogged down because you ate and drank too much, similarly consumer culture is the sickness because it is ultimately about keeping people narrow-minded and obedient to continue consuming. Bad leadership is responsible but the public has also refused to wake up and question things as well. Hence, unless we start with good community values and question, we are headed towards absolute crisis so it is really important to find those good values, practice them and question now more than ever before. Violent revolutions are also not the answer under this understanding and it will help avoid future injustices. Peace and good luck to all!

-------------

OK, i wanna share with you my own experience. (be patient with my English please) Some readers of my blog have suggested to do a IAmA here.

I am from Balkan region, and as some of you may know it was hell here from 92-95, anyway, for 1 whole year i lived and survived in a city of 50 000- 60 000 residents WITHOUT: electricity, fuel,running water,real food distribution, or distribution of any goods, or any kind of organized law or government.

The city was surrounded for 1 year and in that city actually it was SHTF (shit hit the fan) situation.

We did not have organized army or police force, there was groups of defenders, actually anybody who had a gun, fight for his own house and his own family.

Some of us was better prepared, but most of families had food for couple of days, some of us had pistol, few owned AK-47 when all started.

Anyway, after one month or two, gangs started with their nasty job,hospital looked like butchery, police force vanished, 80 percent of hospital staff gone home.

I was lucky, my family was big in that time (15 members in one big house, 5-6pistols, 3 Kalashnikov s) so we lived and survived, most of us.

I remember US Air force dropped MRE every 10 days (god bless USA for that) as help for surrounded city, it just was not enough. Some of houses had little gardens with some vegetables, most did not.

After three months rumors started about first deaths from starvation,deaths from low temperatures, we stripped every door , window frame from abandoned houses for heating, i burned all my own furniture for heating, lot of people died from diseases, mostly from bad water (two of my family members), we used rain water for drink, several times i ate pigeons, once i ate rat.

Money was not worth shit. We traded things, few examples: for 1 corned beef can you could have woman for couple of hours (sounds bad, but it was reality) i remember, most of that women were just desperate mothers, candles, lighters,antibiotics,fuel,batteries, rifle ammo and of course food, we fight like animals for that.

In situation like that lot of things change, most of people turned to monsters, it was ugly.

Strength was in the numbers, if you were alone in the house, you ve been probably robbed and killed, no matter how well armed.

Anyway, war ended, again thanks to America (and again god bless USA for that). It is not important witch side had right in that war.

It was almost 20 years ago when I was a young man, but believe me, for me it was just like yesterday, i remember everything, and i think i learned a lot.

Me and my family are prepared now, i am well armed, stocked and educated. You might also want to start thinking about preparedness even if you live in a safer country.

My English is not that good and I will not say what city it was because i still live there (and there is still a lot of bad blood around) but you can ask me anything and i will answer as good as i can.

Major news outlets are now reporting the beginning of Saudi protests. Not speculation but people starting in small numbers in the streets. Google it to read how some protesters were shot at. This might not end well. 

I also received this email message about food stores today. It is from a club I belong to which sends you a bit of food every month in case you don't have 5k to plunk down on a year kit for a family of four. I don't know if the talk about FEMA buying up all the food supplies is true but a lot of suppliers (*that aren't fly by night new guys*) are reporting they have no supplies for the next three to four months.

""First of all, I want to thank you for being a valued member of the 30 Serving Club.  Our clubs have been very successful over the past year and a half.  We are truly blessed to be in the position to help so many individuals and families “put away a little every month”.  We want to make you aware of how the landscape in the Long Term Storage industry has changed over the past few months.  Last month we all witnessed the outcome of a “high demand” situation that caused months of back orders with Mountain House (MH) products. As a result, they had to suspend supplying to 92% of their dealers to keep up with demand. They kept the very best; including the Freeze Dry Guy.  As of February 4, 2011 all MH dealers were put on “allocation” which meant MH would only ship a certain number of cases. This has quickly evolved into a situation where Mountain House had to announce on March 3, 2011, that all shipping for new orders would cease to the remaining dealers for 3-4 months.""

**Social status is based on resource consumption.**

The more resources you consume in our society, the higher your social status is. This causes both individuals and society as a whole to use resources that we **can not afford**.

Your shoes look damaged, but you can still walk on them? Doesn't matter, you're an embarrassment with broken shoes, it's time you buy new ones. We don't want any gossiping. Don't wear anything second hand either, let alone things out of fashion.

You bought your first car? Well congratulations Billy, now you're finally a real man! Make sure it's a loud one, not a noiseless hybrid for liberal hipster douchebags, you want to be a real man.

You don't eat meat? Are you serious? Really? Well that makes you a pussy. Real men eat meat. Here, try some it's good for you, it makes you strong!

You ride a bicycle? Oh you're one of those annoying smug self-righteous people!

You bought your first house that you can't afford through a risky mortgage? Well, now you really made it in life, congratulations! [If you're Chinese, this will allow you to finally get married.](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-01/05/content_14386646.htm)

The biggest shame for 20-somethings now is to live with their parents, because living on your own has become a measure of success. The biggest fear of the 20-somethings is to move in with their parents, despite this being perfectly normal for much of human history,  and Western societies now having the highest percentage of single households in recorded history. All those single households have people watching TV on their own, heating for a single person as opposed to multiple, maintenance work, etcetera. It is immensely wasteful and does not occur in undeveloped countries.

If it's your first, second,third,fifth...scrap that, ANY anniversary, you HAVE to take your girlfriend out to an expensive restaurant. Otherwise her friends will think you aren't willing to invest significant resources in her any more because he ""takes her for granted"", hence humiliating her. 

If you don't go on vacation this year, well shame on you! Take your crap and fly to some foreign destination and spend two weeks doing stuff you could probably do at home as well. It is of vital importance that you have some pictures on your Facebook to show you didn't dwell in your apartment all summer.

Better yet than the requirement to engage in the above status enhancing rituals, is the prohibition of engaging in status reducing rituals.

If you see something useful laying by the side of the road, don't pick it up! There are masses of vacuum cleaners laying in the garbage, that require a 50 cent repair job to replace a single transistor to have them work again. My dad has repaired numerous vacuum cleaners that he found laying by the side of the road. He builds computers from spare parts he found in computers laying by the side of the road, that are fast enough for my younger brother to play Skyrim on.

If you were willing to ignore the stigma, you could survive without buying food, by simply eating the stuff that is thrown away. There's a name for people who do this, freegans. They eat what others throw away out of ideological convictions. People become less willing to do this kind of stuff though, because every mindless blob of fat now carries a cell phone that it uses to record any individual in its vicinity that is acting out of the ordinary.

I will be accused of sexism for saying this, but the main reason men consume things they can not afford, is because it genuinely makes them more desirable in the eyes of women. Men realize this either consciously or subconsciously, and respond to it by complying and consuming things they do not really need nor desire. 

Now, in the 3rd world, the same thing goes on, but instead of consumption, social status is linked to fertility. The best thing a woman can do there to raise her social status is to have more children. Hence overpopulation doesn't really end, and the fertility rate has hardly declined in 40 years in Nigeria.

Conclusion:

If there was not a social standard that we have to consume to raise social status, we would likely reduce our impact on our planet, and could try to move from growth to sustainability.

However, we fail to do this, as a culture we tie social status to wealth, and men who fail to consume are punished for it (as in the example of China, where men without houses can not marry).

**Introduction**

The purpose of this essay is to explain the unsustainable nature of the phenomenon of Industrial civilization, and to explain how its main achievement, a massive increase in population density and life expectancy (at least in the 1st world) is a temporary phenomenon made possible by borrowing from the past that comes with a price: A rapid and long term decline in population density and life expectancy in the future.

**How are we borrowing from the past?**

Our way of life is mainly made possible by our ability to retrieve energy that was fixated by natural processes over a time period of millions of years, and deposited in the Earth through geological processes. This type of energy is better known to us under the name ""fossil fuel"".

[Fossil fuels are the main source of energy used in the world today, and are expected by major forecasters to continue to provide three quarters of energy used globally by 2035.](http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/2011/02/22/energy-forecasts-agree-on-global-fossil-fuel-domination/)

Although it is true that many 1st world countries also use renewable energy, most of these energy sources are made possible through the exportation of manufacturing to the 3rd world, where cheap sources of energy such as coal are used instead. Furthermore, many forms of renewable energy are heavily dependent upon government subsidies without which they would not be affordable. People in the 1st world use non-fossil fuel in their own homes, while buying products made in the 3rd world that were until recently produced in their own countries, with fossil fuels.

Renewable energy also paradoxically increases fossil fuel use. As an example, the use of biofuel in gasoline for automobiles decreases fuel efficiency. [Furthermore, the intermittent character of many forms of fossil fuel reduces the efficiency of energy sources such as natural gas, which are most efficient when used at full power, which is not always possible due to energy sources such as wind energy.](http://davidmdelaney.com/Ferguson/Fundamental-problem-6.pdf) 

It is estimated that all oil that is globally available was produced in a time period of anywhere between 50 and 300 million years. All available oil that is commercially extractable will be used in a period of about 125 years. Hence we can reason that our current pattern of oil consumption consumes a natural resource at about a million times the rate at which it is generated.

Hence, engineers seeking to use renewable energy sources for liquid fuels will have to figure out a method of converting sunlight into biofuel that is about a million times more efficient than the natural process that led to the oil that we are currently using. 

For coal and natural gas, similar numbers apply. Methods of capturing energy from sunlight will have to be developed and put into use that are more efficient than those that nature used over a period of millions of years to allow the spectacle that we have generated in the past century or so to continue. 

Considering that we are currently already using about 50% of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity, biofuels are unlikely to provide a long term solution, especially when we consider that the EROI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested) is somewhere around 1:1, according to recent estimates. Such an EROI means that biofuels are not really a source of energy, but merely a method of energy conversion. [Considering that an EROI of 3:1 is considered required to build a civilization on](http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25), they appear to provide no hope for the future of industrial civilization, [along with Shale oil, which requires massive amounts of energy investment to retrieve, refine and distribute as well.](http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/08/shale-20100803.html)

All of this is important, because modern agriculture is dependent upon fossil fuels. [About 10 calories of fossil fuel are used for every calorie of food produced.](http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/100303_eating_oil.html) More importantly, to produce the same amount of food, we are starting to need increasingly larger amounts of fossil fuel. How is this possible?

There are multiple reasons for this. Many local sources of water and fertilizer and soil are being eliminated, requiring farmers to import those sources from further abroad. This causes us to use increasing amounts of energy to distribute those resources to our agricultural fields.

Furthermore, urbanization and migration causes people to live in areas where food can not be produced, requiring food to be transported further, hence requiring more fossil fuel use to deliver the same calories of nutrition to people.

**Other gifts from the past**

This brings us to our other gifts from the past. Not just oil, gas and coal are gifts of nature to us. Some other gifts are forests, peat, ""fossil water"", soil and guano.

We have used up Guano, which was once used as fertilizer by our ancestors. Similarly, we have used up most our forests. We turned to coal and potassium to replace these resources.

A few principles are important to note here:

1. **Moving from one resource to a new resource generally increases pollution.** Pollution is a form of borrowing from the future, because pollution will decrease life expectancy in the future and reduce the maximum possible population density by contaminating ground water and sometimes even making the land uninhabitable.

Pollution increases because the best and most pure sources of a resource are used first. As an example, consider the case of coal we prefer to use Anthracite over Sub-bituminous coal. Anthracite burns brighter, and delivers more energy per weight unit of coal. Because it is purer carbon, it contains less uranium, mercury and other types of contaminants.

Similarly, rock phosphate contains far more uranium, while Guano, which is a fancy name for bird droppings and which was used before rock phosphate, contains very little contaminants.

As another example, consider the transition from earlier oil fields to offshore oil fields which caused BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and now our transition to oil shale fields which are even more polluting. A similar case exists with natural gas, with the United States now using a horribly polluting method called fracking.

2. **As one resource starts to deplete it takes increasing amounts of other resources to maintain our consumption of that resource.** Consider our problem of running out of ground water in many places. We can transport water from other places, which increases our fossil fuel use. We can also convert salt water into saline water, which also required energy, hence also increasing our fossil fuel use.

As another example, consider our declining EROI. The oil we find is increasingly sour and unusable, which further increases the need for refinement. The refineries use fossil fuels to refine the oil, hence further increases fossil fuel demand.

We can eventually start using shale oil, which requires using fresh water to get it out of the ground. 

Hence, I now arrive at the point where I answer the obvious rebuttal, the obvious rebuttal being:

&gt;""Through innovation we will find a solution to our problem.""

Historically, innovation has nearly always meant jumping from one resource to another resource. This was possible, because plenty of resources remained. We solved the problem of running out of wood by jumping over to peat or coal. We solved the depletion of Guano by jumping over to rock phosphate.

But now, every resource we use is facing depletion. And worse, our efforts to maintain our current levels of consumption of some resources is increasing our use of other resources, hence leading to *their* depletion.

Consider for example the idea of building new nuclear power plants to solve our energy crisis (our real energy crisis being the fact that we are starting to need increasingly higher amounts of energy as a result of the trends described earlier). Nuclear power plants take water from a river, and dump warm water back into the river to generate the electricity that they provide us with. The problem is that other industries also take water from the river to generate products or energy.

[Scientists predict that the increasing temperature of river water will decrease the output of our thermoelectric energy plants, which include both nuclear and fossil energy plants.](http://www.iol.co.za/scitech/science/environment/nuclear-coal-power-face-climate-change-risk-1.1310928)

Hence the construction of new nuclear power plants to ""solve"" our problem that would warm the river water further would further decrease the output of other power plants utilizing the same river.

1338946309.0,60,self.collapse,un50d,A few common misconceptions about collapse,growth_kills_nature,76,16,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/un50d/a_few_common_misconceptions_about_collapse/,"I'd like to go over some common misconceptions I've heard many times on this subreddit and in real life.

It seems like the most common one is that [""humans are very innovative""](http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2012/02/techno-fix-why-technology-wont-save-us-or-the-environment.html). I've heard this **so many** times. It's not necessarily untrue. Yes, we have large brains and have made many inventions over thousands of years that have allowed us to sort of bypass the laws of nature and live unsustainably for a short period of time (10,000 years is relatively short when factoring in the age of humanity). But that doesn't mean that we can live unsustaibably forever, and we cannot invent new energy. Solar and wind are great, but they cannot save civilization. Don't get me started on [nuclear energy](http://www.realnews24.com/fukushima-reactor-no-4-vulnerable-to-catastrophic-collapse-could-unleash-85-times-cesium-137-radiation-of-chernobyl-human-civilization-on-the-brink/). They are alternatives, but not replacements. There is NO replacement for oil. Oil is the most dense, easy and rich fuel there is. 

The next misconception is that humans work together during times of crisis and Americans will escape the worst of collapse because ""our culture is different"" than the countries that are currently in a more advanced stage of collapse. [Take a look at Greece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGp2frlqbGI); riots, crime, cronic hungry, poverty, and rampant suicide (they went from having the lowest suicide rates in the EU to the highest). Greece was a 1st world country. We can look at many examples of other countries that have been in an advanced state of collapse for a long time now. We're not that different than them. The biggest differences is our immense, debt-driven prosperity, and American exceptionalism and arrogance, or nationalism. Take away the false wealth and you will see how we are not that different from our fellow humans around the world. The arrogance and self-entitlement of Americans and other 1st world nations [will make our collapse the worst](http://youtu.be/O30-vchHl6w). We have become a very individualistic society. Community is bascially non-existant. Many Americans can only rely on their partner and maybe one friend. We have also lost many traditions and skills. Most people don't even know how to grow food, which is something everyone will need to do.

The 3rd misconception is that people who talk about preparing for collapse and mention guns or survival strategies are sociopaths and want to live out their ""Mad Max fantasies"". This may be the most insulting misconception. Please don't shoot the messenger. Those of us who can talk about things like a die-off or having to kill another person are not sociopaths. We have just entered the last stage of greiving: acceptance. I have probably been in this stage for close to a year. Many of the newcomers and complainers about this subreddit are most likely in the denial or anger stage. They feel this subreddit is a personal attack of sorts. People get very defensive when collapse is discussed. This goes back to the arrogance and belief that we can innovate our way out of all our problems. Many people see humans as being above animals and forget that the same rules that apply to animals still apply to us. We are very smart, but out biggest weakness is the lack of foresight. Humans, like all animals, have evolved to focus on immediate problems. Out media and government helps this by lulling people into a false sense of security that things will get better. In order to understand collapse most people have to invest at least 10 or 20 hours of research. If you haven't don't that, you should.

Lastly, ""Collapse will be slow"". Correction: Collapse *seems* to **have** been slow. Depending on when you think it started. I choose 2007 or 2001 as the beginning. Five or ten years isn't really that long when you consider how long humans have been around. It doesn't mean it will be slow. Things can, and will happen very quickly when systems and institutions collapse. We're out of 'quick fixes' and there are no more resources to exploit. They have a domino effect. We've all heard the term ""the bigger they are, the harder they fall"", and it's true. We're approaching a tipping point. It's likely to be the next round of financial collapse that sets things off, with Europe being the [epicenter](http://cluborlov.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/fragility-and-collapse-slowly-at-first.html).

I hope I've gotten through to a few collapse-curious folks out there. If not, it's not a big deal to me. I'm used to people putting up a defensive wall. I've just been wanting to get this off my chest for a while. When you reply, please remember that this is not a personal attack on the intellegence of you or humans in general. I don't really want to argue. I'm sick of arguing. It usually never gets anywhere unless people invest time to [research on their own](http://collapsenet.com/).

Since that time, oil has steadily moved upwards, with one little dip in the fall of last year.  Over the last few weeks we've seen a drop in price to less than $80 per barrel.  What I find troubling is the timing.  Normally oil consumption increases this time of year.  If oil prices continue to fall, it *could* (please notice I'm not saying *will*) indicate a drop in demand more than an increase in supply.  This would indicate another recession is upon us.  That would be consistent with recent jobs reports, but I don't want to go on the record at this point as saying another recession has already begun.  I'll just say that there is a red flag in my mind.

By the way, if oil prices continue to fall we are in for some interesting outcomes worldwide.  During the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia realized that riots were coming their way, so they doubled their spending on social services to prevent it.  The problem for them with low oil prices is that they now need oil to sell for at least $90/barrel in order to keep their services expenditures up.  

Another issue is the feedback cycle from dropping oil prices.  Many of the unconventional sources of oil require so much energy input that they are not feasible to extract below a certain price.  IIRC, that level is about $80 for tar sands in Canada (I'm sure there are many estimates for the actual price level).  I don't know what it is for shale oil in North Dakota.  If prices go too low, layoffs in these sectors will surely follow.  Given that these are good paying jobs with typically low savings rates, it would only feed a downward trend.

Anyway, I wondered what the rest of you thought about all this.  Am I being too jumpy?  Not jumpy enough?  Any other thoughts on the situation?",,False,,t5_2qhw9,False,,,True,t3_ve5z5,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ve5z5/do_any_of_you_follow_oil_prices/,

Yes jobs aren't secure and the future looks a little bleak, but collapse isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It has happened over and over again throughout history, and people always come together, rebuild, and things are usually better because of it (for a while at least).  The process of collapse can be uncomfortable, but because you all are aware of it, you know it doesn't necessarily have to be as bad as it could be.  

I've spent most of my life studying self-reliance and survival (as I'm sure many of you have), and I've gotten to the point in my life now where I feel like I have the knowledge to live very well, no matter what.  I can protect my kids, I live in the right place, I can grow my own food, and I've learned to live without electricity should I need to.  To me, this is a hopeful thing and I feel glad that there are 18,000 others in this subreddit who recognize the need for that kind of knowledge.  It makes it better for all of us.
