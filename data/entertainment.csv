(x/post from /r/news)",Gadgetstorms,2307,775,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/vllfu/louie_ck_ditches_ticketmaster_sells_tickets_for/,"Received this email from info@louisck.com moments ago:

Please excuse the double post- I didn't know the proper place for this to go. 

- - - - -

hello folks!  I'm going on tour this  year from October through
Feb.  I'll be all over the goddamn place.  This year, I'm trying
something new, building on the fun, success and fan-benifit of
selling my content online.  We are selling tickets to this tour
exclusively here on louisck.com.  I only wanted to do this if
there was a way, like with LIVE AT THE BEACON, that  it could
bring the price of tickets down and make them easier and less
complicated to buy.  We figured out a way.

Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things
have always worked against that.  High ticket charges and ticket
re-sellers marking up the prices.  Some ticketing services charge
more than 40% over the ticket price and, ironically, the lower
I've made my ticket prices, the more scalpers have bought them
up, so the more fans have paid for a lot of my tickets.

By selling the tickets exclusively on my site, I've cut the
ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price.
To buy a ticket, you join NOTHING.  Just use your credit card and
buy the damn thing.   opt in to the email list if you want, and
you'll only get emails from me.

Also, you'll see that if you try to sell the ticket anywhere for
anything above the original price, we have the right to cancel
your ticket (and refund your money).  this is something I intend
to enforce.  There are some other rules you may find annoying but
they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing
the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice
the price from a thousand miles away.

Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass, but please be
patient.  My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are
able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a
ticket.  Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of
buying a ticket.

Tickets across the board, everywhere, are 45 dollars.  That's
what you'll actually pay.  In every case, that will be less than
anyone has actually  paid to see me (after ticket charges)  in
about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you
paid last year.

The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone
who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my
control.  That makes me VERY happy.  The 45 dollars also includes
sales tax, which I'm paying for you.  So I'm making more or less
depending on the state.

Another benifit to me is also one to you.  I get your email
address (if you opt in) when you opt in.  You don't have to join
ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in, youll only hear
from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.

Obviously  none of this means anything if the shows aren't good.
So that's up to me.  As I do every year, I'll be performing a
brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.

Lastly, it was a real challenge to find venues around the country
that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these
perameters.  It means I'm playing in very new places.  I really
appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a
try.

Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult.  this
ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope
it works and that there aren't any problems.  If anything comes
up, please be patient.

Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have
made if I did a standard tour, using the usual very excellent but
expensive ticketing service.  In some cities I've had to play
smaller venues and do more shows.  But I like doing more shows
and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am
making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that
interested me is bringing your price down.  Either way, I still
make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and
raised chickens in Michigan.

alright, that's it, folks.  I'll be sending this message out to
folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays
it out much more simply with the proper links.  I am doing this
because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL, (which is
still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got
the email really enjoyed the long, verbose, unedited message.
The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price, a link,
and me shutting the fuck up.

This way, you can read this if you like, or your can just see the
massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage, and focus
on the simple email.

I hope to see you all on the road.

regards,

Louis C.K.",,False,self,t5_2qh0f,1340668467.0,,,True,t3_vllfu,http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/vllfu/louie_ck_ditches_ticketmaster_sells_tickets_for/,

When I'm hating on the world (for things like the treatment of Assange, or the passing of tax breaks for rich people) I remind myself of this story.",bickerstaff,1710,756,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/eogut/i_used_to_be_on_extreme_makeover_home_edition/,"I was working one night very late on a house; it was the day before the family was to return, which means we were in for a long night.

I was working on a room with the show muralist, Nancy. (She's awesome.)  We were painting and putting up mouldings and doing the usual last minute stuff.  The worksite was always completely crazy then, sometimes a thousand people still working, landscaping going in, painting trim, furniture moving around, pictures getting hung; it's an impossible amount of activity packed into a rediculously small space.

At that point, there are always a bunch of charities and ""awareness"" groups on site; they are volunteering or helping out however they can and generally are very helpful.  In addition to the ubiquitous blue shirts that everyone wears on site (except us) they usually wear hats or badges or something that identifies them as part of the American Lung Association or the Red Cross or the Autism Awareness people and so on.

At any rate, a young and pretty woman comes into my room at one point and says, ""Hey, I'm with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  What can I do?""  So Nancy hooks her up with some paint and a can and shows her how to do the wall treatment we were finishing up.  

Of course, we all get to talking and after a few hours of working in this relatively small room, things can sometimes get sorta personal, and Nancy asks the pretty woman, ""So what do you do for Make-A-Wish?""  The woman (whose name I'm not saying for the sake of her privacy) looks at us with a quizzical expression before she smiles and says, ""Oh, I'm sorry.  I guess I wasn't clear.""  Nancy and I put our brushes down and turn to her, and the young woman continues, ""I don't WORK for Make-A-Wish.  I'm a client.   I'm here because this was my wish, to build a house for someone who needed one, on your show.""

And then what do you say?  We nodded and went back to work and after a few minutes of silence, I figured I'd go ahead and poke the elephant in the room and so I asked the only question that makes any sense, the one that everyone was thinking but couldn't say.  ""Whaddaya got?"" I said.

She didn't even pause, ""Leukemia.  The bad kind.""   And then she laughed, ""you know, not the GOOD leukemia..."" and she kept right on painting as if she were completely unaware that she had just changed our lives.

We finished up the room, the family came home, everyone cried, they always do.  

Nancy and I hugged each other the next day and sobbed out of exhaustion and emotion (both are abundant at the end of a build) and we both knew that we'd never see the pretty young woman again; how could we?

I don't know what the specifics of her wish were, maybe it was ""I want to be on TV!"" or maybe it was ""I want to help a family in need"" or maybe it was exactly what she said, ""I want to work on a build for Extreme.""  But either way, that was five years ago and remains one of the most moving moments of my life, and often serves to bolster my faith in the world, or at least for its children.

Its louis here.  I'm clacking this to you on my phone in my dressing room here at studio 8H, right in 30 rockefeller center, in Manhattan, new york city, new york, america, world, current snapshot of all existence everywhere.

Tonight I'm hosting Saturday Night Live, something I zero ever in my life saw happening to me. And yet here it is completely most probably happening (I mean, ANYTHING could NOT happen.  So we'll see).

I've been working here all week with the cast, crew, producers and writers of SNL, and with Lorne Michaels. Such a great and talented group of people.

And here we are in the middle of New York City, which was just slammed by a hurricane, leaving behind so much trouble, so much difficulty and trauma, which everyone here is still dealing with every day.

Last night we shot some pre-tape segments in greenwich Village, which was pitch black dark for blocks and blocks, as it has been for a week now.

Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness.  It can't even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene.  But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead.   I can't tell you how that felt.  And you also had a palpable sense that inside each dark window was a family or a student or an artist or an old woman living alone, just being int he dark and waiting for the day to come back. Like we were all having one big sleep over, but not so much fun as that.

This is how a lot of the city is still.  I know people in queens, brooklyn, Staten Island, new jersey, all over, are not normal yet.  And not normal is hard.

And here at 30 rock, these folks are working so hard this week.  There are kids in the studio every day, because members of the crew and staff had to bring them to work.   Many people are sharing lodging.  Everyone is tired.  But there's this feeling here that we've got to put on a great show.  I'm sure it feels like that here every week.  But wow.  I feel really lucky to be sharing this time with these particular good folks here at SNL.

In about 5 hours we'll be going on the air.   I'll do a monologue.  And we'll show you some sketches that we wrote and try to make you laugh.   I'm gonna look really dumb in some of this stuff.  But I don't care. Its awfully worth it. And I'm really excited.

Anyway.  I just wanted to let you know.  If you watch the show tonight, when Don Pardo says my name and you see me walking out, all the shit in this email is what ill be thinking.  I'm a pretty lucky guy.   I hope you enjoy the show.

Thanks.

Louis C.K.

I have way too much time: the total is 138-ish.,larry_b,889,186,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/15y5tj/characters_in_friends_didnt_have_85_total_sex/,"I know every Friend episode by heart. I watched each and every one of them more than once to come up with this total, which includes past sex partners that are just mentioned. Detailed Excel spreadsheet and everything. I wish someone would do a graphic representation of this. ([Here](http://imgur.com/rawrv) is the only graph I attempted.)

This is the general data:

Confirmed sex (either by strong innuendo or plain admission) = 1. 
Unconfirmed sex (e.g., 'I dated a guy...') = 0,5.

* Chandler: 10.5 sex partners
* Ross: 14 sex partners
* Monica: 14.5 sex partners
* Rachel: 15.5 sex partners
* Phoebe: 32.5 sex partners
* Joey: 51.5 sex partners

Some trivia:

* In episode 22 of Season 2 (""The One with the Two Parties""), Joey took the lead in sex partner count and there was no way back.
* Joey and Ross have taken part in threesomes. (EDIT: As several redditors pointed out, Ross' threesome wasn't really real. The *other* woman taking part (Susan) wasn't included in Ross' stats, so the numbers are fine. No worries. Thankfully, the universe isn't going to implode.)
* Season 6 was definitely the quietest sex-wise. **Only 4.5 new sex partners** are discovered.
* During Season 1, Monica is the most promiscuous character (with **9.5 sex partners** discovered). In Season 3 Joey breaks this record, with 10.5 new sex partners discovered.
* Chandler holds the record for LESS new partners discovered continuously. After having sex with Monica (end of Season 4), no new sex partners are discovered until the end of the series (i.e., 6 seasons with no new sex partners mentioned.) Regarding Monica, we discover in episode 11 of Season 7 (""The One with All the Cheesecakes"") that she had had sex with Stuart, her cousin's new husband.
* Phoebe surpasses Joey in new sex partners' discoveries in 4 seasons (1, 6, 8 and 10).

Enjoy!

**TL;DR: I've carried out a profound study on Friends' sex life and sharing some info makes me feel less of a moron.**

EDIT: Wow, what a beautiful response. I have now uploaded my Excel spreadsheet with all the details. Click [here](http://www.filedropper.com/friendssexstats) to download (I couldn't find any other better/quicker way to share it.) It includes the **name, episode of first mention and comments of each sex partner of each Friend** (quite organized, of course. Comment cells in grey indicate ""unconfirmed sex"" (or ""half sex"", the term I used in the spreadsheet). The second tab or sheet (named ""stats per season"" is exactly that: a summary of the data but in numeric form, per season. It includes the graph, of course.

Enjoy!

EDIT 2: Well, this post has been featured in several media outlets, which is pretty cool.

1278221829.0,523,self.entertainment,clsxv,Note To Hollywood Marketers: Your Film Trailers are too long and often give away TOO DAMN MUCH of the film. ,bongozap,851,328,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/clsxv/note_to_hollywood_marketers_your_film_trailers/,"Lousy 3D conversions and the endless parade of garbage peddled upon us is insulting enough. But as I watched my obligatory 20 minutes of previews in the theater tonight, fully half of the trailers showed too much of the movie.

Even ones that started out catching my interest, quickly lost it when I saw so much that I was able to identify generic plot arcs. 

The fact that you folks continue to foist crappy gimmicks on us only proves you hold us in contempt and find us to be stupid.

Still, I'm an average guy, so if you're losing me, you're losing others too.

EDIT: A lot of great responses (even most of the negative ones). To clarify, I don't hate trailers out of hand.  I love the whole movie-going experience including the trailers. It's just I think trailers over the past few years have generally (not all mind you as some are quite good) gotten too anti-climactic in terms of the films they're designed to promote because they give away too much of the story.

And while I realize it's not a new phenomenon, it does seem (to me anyway) more (and increasingly) prevalent these days.

EDIT #2: Numerous folks have made a point throughout this thread that the marketing philosophy is people won't go see a film unless they know what it's about..

I think the best response is this:

There is a big difference between making a trailer that gives an enticing idea of what the film is about, thereby leading to a moviegoer deciding to buy a ticket...or making a trailer that gives away the whole movie.

Looper is an R-rated action thriller set in the near future, when time-travel has been invented but is only available on the black market. When the mob wants to get rid of someone, they send them back in time, and a Looper is there to mop up. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is making a very good living as a Looper, until one day they send a target back through time that he recognizes – his future self (Bruce Willis).

Real movie I'm seeing on Tuesday. I'll report back with my findings... for science.


**EDIT:** For those of you still interested. It was Amazing with a capital A. The NDA doesn't let me go into much detail, but think (12 Monkeys + Terminator) x Frequency and you have a vague idea of it. I'm certain time travel fans everywhere will approve.

**Also,** for those concerned about the whole JGL -&gt; Brude Willis transformation. JGL dons some mildly ridiculous prosthetics to make him look and sound more like young Bruce Willis.

I *love* the intensity, sound, most of the actors and the cinematography. I had major issues with the writing/story in this new episode. Please correct me on any of these points so I can be a little less depressed:

1. I think the trip they embarked on was all of 120 miles or something like that. And the radiator hose breaks. Again. I have had 6 cars and they have come and gone for numerous reasons. I have never had a radiator hose ""break"" that I know of. This thing breaks every other show. 

2. It broke while going slow through the stopped cars. They couldn't take an alternate route because they were too low on gas. Again wasn't this just a 120 mile trip? 

3. Crossbow guy wants a motorcycle - cool. But how loud a bike do you really want to be driving? 

4. Only one guy goes on the roof to watch for zombies. Somehow he only sees them when they are right on the group. 

5. No signal system to alert the others.

6. Black guy has wandered way up ahead. Almost kills himself as he... tries to sit down? 

7. Kids are ""exploring"". In a zombie-infested world. The kids are exploring. ""Stay where I can see you honey..."". How about ""stay tied to my back""?

8. Zombies can't smell all these humans and walk on by for the most part.

9. The blond in the RV tries to assemble a gun that she doesn't know how to assemble, when all she needed to do was be quiet.

10. Zombie sees the girl and chases. One guy runs off to help her? One? The mom doesn't run along also? 

11. The mom doesn't join the first search. Just a couple guys. 

12. The next day they set out *with the sun high in the sky*. Really you guys slept in with a little girl missing? They get into some big debate about giving blond her gun or not. Again, a girl is missing folks. 

13. They go looking for her single file. They aren't spread out whatsoever to maximize their search.

14. Disable church megaphone rather than calling the girl on it. After 24 hours don't you just go all out and risk attracting zombies to find her?

15. Oh now let's stop and pray. How dumb would the mom feel if they arrived 10 seconds too late to save her daughter, all from stopping to pray?

15. Now let's talk about the affair we had. 

16. Now let's talk about running away.

17. Now the sheriff needs to pray. No rush.

18. More debate over giving blond a gun. 

19. Ooh a deer. Go ahead kid, walk up to it. We have nothing better to do. Hey it isn't running away (which would sound alarm bells in my head). Oh wow a hunter saw the deer, but not us, shot the deer right at that moment and the bullet went right through and hit you. What are the odds. 

I'll keep watching because zombies. But man this is some sad writing IMO.",,False,self,t5_2qh0f,False,,,True,t3_lgay9,http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/lgay9/walking_dead_wtf/,

I posted an idea on r/CrazyIdeas about a month ago, and it quickly grew in popularity, being the all time top post of the subreddit ATM. While first thinking it was a crazy idea, I started to consider if it would actually be something people would watch, and if I should sell the idea to a TV-station. The idea is as follows:


11 gay men and 1 straight man are locked in a house, like in Big Brother. The object for the gay men is to find out who is straight. Once a week someone gets outvoted, until 2 men are left, or the straight man is out. If the gays manage to outvote him, they win 1 million dollars. If the straight man is among the 2 last people in the house in the end, he wins 1 million dollars.

*Now here's the twist:* None of the men are actually gay, they just all think they are the straight man.

**TLDR:** Straight men behaving like homosexuals on TV.


So, r/entertainment, would you watch a show like this?

Many people have asked me to post this list, so here it goes. Ordered by appearance or first mention, per Friend:

**Chandler (10.5 sexual partners):**

* Janice
* Aurora (ep. 01-06)
* Nina Bookbinder (01-16)
* Jade (02-05) (Chandler wasn't as good as Bob, and much more bumpy) 
* Susie 'Underpants' Moss (02-13)
* Girl who though Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia (02-18)
* Mary Angela Tribbiani (might not have been full-on sex. That's the .5)
* Joanna (They took the relationship to the next level, alright)
* Kathy (Joey's ex)
* Marjorie (04-20, from the sleep clinic)
* Monica.


**Ross (14 sexual partners):**

* Carol
* Julie 
* Rachel
* Chloe (03-15)
* Bonnie (03-25)
* Emily
* Janice (05-12)
* Elizabeth
* Lady who cleaned his dorm in college (07-04) (Ross mentions it himself, although that would mean he was lying when he said Carol had been the only woman he'd slept with. Shall we blame the writers?)
* Whitney (07-05) (Hums While He Pees' ex-wife. Hurt Ross' back a little.)
* Girl with whom Ross was caught having sex in the paleontology section of the school's library (07-07)
* Mona
* Girl who dumped Ross during sex (08-15)
* Charlie Wheeler


**Monica (14.5 sexual partners):**

* Paul 'The Wine Guy'
* Alan (01-03) (When Rachel mentions his possible penis size, Monica's reaction suggests she knows)
* Steve (01-03) (No further reference; counts as .5)
* Jason Hurley (01-04)
* Kevin Millmore (01-05) (Suggests he broke up with her repeatedly; seems fair to assume there was sex)
* Pool table guy (01-07)
* Fun Bobby
* Howard, the 'I win' guy
* Scotty Jared (01-14)
* Ethan (01-22) (Sex with a minor!)
* Richard Burke
* Julio (03-11)
* Pete Becker
* Chandler
* Stuart (07-11) (Her cousin's now-husband)


**Rachel (15.5 sexual partners):**

* Barry Finkle (Farber)
* Tony Demarco (01-01) (Monica references him as a very passionate (yet shallow) thing, and Rachel replies suggestively)
* Paolo
* Pete 'The Weeper' Carny (01-14, also referenced in 02-18)
* Adam Ritter (01-14) (Rachel was keeping his boxer shorts as a souvenir)
* Billy Dreskin (01-17, confirmed in 02-18)
* Guy whose cat didn't like Rachel (02-03) ('Stopped seeing me' is the reference. Counts as .5)
* Stevie Fisher's dad (02-05) (It is suggested that she 'fooled around' with him. Counts as .5)
* Ross (In 02-18 she supposedly mentions all of her sexual partners; however, since she didn't mention Adam Ritter, we assume she could have also forgotten 'Guy whose cat didn't like Rachel' and Stevie Fisher's dad, above)
* Tommy (03-22) (By the way they sort of cuddled in the coffee house, there could have been sex at some point. Counts as .5)
* Josh (04-05) (College guy; not to be confused with Joshua. Since he stole money from her, we assume 'he might have had access'.  Counts as .5)
* Patrick (04-10) (He flung Rachel)
* Joshua (04-20) (In 04-18 Rachel was going to have sex with him for the 1st time; in this episode she says there's a great physical connection with him. She's exaggerating, but it seems logical that there was sex.)
* Chip Matthews (05-08) (In this episode we find out that he and Rachel 'already kind of did it' and that next time 'it'll last for an entire song' = sex)
* Paul Stevens (06-21, sex confirmed in 06-23)
* Charlie (07-01) (She went to 3rd base with Monica's cousin. There could have been sex before or after. Counts as .5  anyway)
* Tag Jones (07-12) (By this time they're shown as an established couple)
* Teacher (07-18) (She got under him)


**Phoebe (32.5 sexual partners):**

* Carl (01-01) (The chalk-eater. Since she cared so much about him, we assume there must've been sex)
* Jason Hurley (01-04) (Slept with him 1 hour after he broke up with Monica)
* Tony (01-04)
* Milwaukee guy (01-07)
* David (the scientist guy)
* Roger (01-13)
* Puppet guy (01-13) (Mentioned by Joey's dad. Also mentioned in 02-19)
* Nokolulu-nk-a-ah (sp?) (01-14) (Phoebe was keepin a dinner recepit; we assume that since she kept it but at the same time she kinda hated him, they must've had sex)
* Guy who dumped her because she fell asleep during Spinal Tap (02-03) (Counts as .5)
* Scott (02-07) (AKA Joey's God)
* Rob Donan (02-12) (We only see kisses, but something more might have easily happened in between. Counts as .5)
* Ryan (02-23) (The Navy guy)
* Unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor (03-11)
* Vince (03-23)
* Larry (05-07) (She was pretty turned on by the badge and wasn't afraid of showing it during their dates, so we assume there was sex)
* Gary (05-17)
* Guy she married in Vegas (06-01) (It's only fair to assume that if she married someone in Vegas, she slept with him. However, this whole story is really really vague. Counts as .5)
* Kenny, the copy boy (06-08) (Suggested to Rachel that getting laid with him would help her. She knew)
* Kyle 'Hums While He Pees' (07-05)
* Guy with whom she had a date three days ago (07-15) (Not a date. Just friends getting together and having sex)
* Jake (07-18) (By the location of the hickey, it's fair to assume there was sex)
* Tim (08-05) (She was pretty eager to have sex with him. It's not completely clear if they did fornicate. Counts as .5)
* Short crazy guy (08-11)
* Don (08-16) ('A girl's gotta eat')
* Parker (08-18) (At night he treats her like the naughty girl she is)
* Guy with whom she was having sex when she broke her leg (08-23) (There was a typo in a sex manual. Since we haven't seen her with a broken leg, we assume this guy is 'new' to the list)
* Mike Hannigan
* Pablo Díaz (10-06) ('Dated' is the reference. However, judging by some of the other names (and references) in Phoebe's book, there could have been some action. Counts as .5)
* Brady Smith (10-06) (*idem*. Counts as .5)
* Guy in Van (10-06) ('My first love' is the reference. Sex)
* Bob Gremore (10-06) ('Dated' is the reference. However, judging by some of the other names (and references) in Phoebe's book, there could have been some action. Counts as .5)
* Jethro Tull (10-06) (JT is a band of 5 members. By Phoebe's reaction, we assume she engaged in sexual acts with all of them)


**Joey (51.5 sexual partners):**

* Andrea (01-01) (Chandler says 'Andrea is the screamer'; we assume she doesn't just *randomly* screams)
* Angela (01-05)
* Women's room of the New York City Library's girl (01-07)
* Sandy (01-10) (Hot single mom at the store)
* Angela Delvecio (01-12) (Could be the same Angela from 01-05; however, she didn't look Italian, so we're counting Delvecio as a separate sex partner)
* Lorraine (01-14) (We assume they had sex after/before/during licking chocolate mousse off each other)
* Melanie (01-24)
* Lori (02-10) (This fornication gave Joey his role as Dr. Drake Ramorey)
* Erica (02-12) (We assume the hand licking led to something else; plus, Joey told her she was the only one. There definitely was sex)
* Shannon Cooper (02-22)
* Stacy Roth (02-22)
* Stacy Roth's roommate (02-22)
* Stripper 1 (03-01) (The reference is 'dated a stripper'. Even though it's a stripper and it's Joey, we'll count it as .5)
* Girl who did it with Joey on the back of the Staten Island ferry (03-01) (It could have been one of the girls mentioned before. Counts as .5)
* Annie Esposito (03-05)
* Annie Esposito's sister (03-05)
* Katherine (03-11) (Threesome with Donna)
* Donna (03-11) (Threesome with Katherine)
* Ginger (03-14) (When Joey tells the story of the leg burning he never mentions that that's when he realized she had a prosthetic leg. They had gone out a few times already, but there are no suggestions or direct clues for sex. Counts as .5)
* Lauren (03-20)
* Kate Miller (03-20)
* Beth (03-20)
* Jennifer Laurio (03-20)
* Mrs. Laurio (03-20)
* Kathy (04-05)
* Casey (04-07) (Chandler says to Joey 'having sex with an endless line of beautiful women…' and Joey didn't say otherwise, so we assume there was sex)
* Stripper 2 (04-22)
* Felicity (04-24)
* Girl with whom Joey had sex a couple of days ago (05-13) (Since Joey has never restrained to give out the names of his partners, we assume that this girl isn't one of his previously mentioned sex partners)
* Katie (05-15) (Having in mind how Joey works ('I'll just do what *I do* on dates'), we assume they're having sex)
* Woman who's really good in bed (05-16)
* Woman who's really good in bed's roommate (05-16)
* Janine Lecroix (06-11) (They first kissed in 06-10. In this episode they seem like a somewhat established couple, so we assume there was sex. It's Joey)
* Girl with whom Joey had sex today (07-01) ('Some… not a lot')

The only way to watch it outside of the US. Now it's gone, and I'm going into withdrawal. Darn, why Hulu, why? Why do you have to take away this as well?

Wed Feb 16: Jipee, service is back up!

Update:

* In case you're wondering what's new. The dailyshow moved to Hulu entirely. thedailyshow.com is now served trough the hulu player from their own site (it wasn't until the day before yesterday).
* I know about torrents, but I usually don't bother.
* The X-Forwarded-For hack is known to me, but I mainly use Chrome, and don't bother even starting FF for it.
* The Dailyshow used to be proud of the fact that others abroad watched it, and it felt good to be a welcome viewer. Now I don't feel welcome anymore. I guess that's the why of me loosing my favorite show. They don't want me to watch their show, so I don't.
* The suggestions about how to circumvent the broken industrial-entertainment complex are welcome. But please also consider the rammifications. A **lot** of people don't know how to torrent or tweak their HTTP headers, and to most people around the world, thedailyshow has now just become another web-video that didn't play. Why should they even try to get it some other way? Just another broken site in the sea of websites. Nothing lost, right? It makes me sad :/
* I know I sound like a lazy bastard, and I can certify, that would be a 100% true assessment of my character (even tough I could solve the problem for myself). But I also think stuff should just work (tm) without me having to ""fix"" it. Nevertheless, me fixing it for me, won't fix it for anybody else, or indeed, the majority of people who should happen to stumble upon thedailyshow.com.

A-ha, apparently there is a [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_133268973405216&amp;view=docs) for that, as well as a [rally to restore the daily show](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rally-to-restore-The-Daily-Show-stream-outside-US/162915560424116) outside the US (how quaint). In case you'd like to vent your opinion feel free to mail thedailyshow@comedycentral.com and support@comedycentral.com

Then I figured out how utterly fucking stupid Scientology is, if I recall correctly, through a South Park episode. Since then I have been unable to watch his old or new movies. I just can't get over the fact of how much of an idiot you have to be to subject yourself to such stupidity. 

It's not that I'm ""missing out"" on Tom Cruise movies that's the point here. I'm just wondering if anyone else has an aversion to his acting, like I do, knowing his religion and how crazy it is.
