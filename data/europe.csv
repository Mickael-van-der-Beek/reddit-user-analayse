/r/Europe has hit 20,000 members and it's time for a fresh member survey.

The survey has 3 pages, and should take no more than a minute per page to complete.

I will keep the survey live for a week before closing it and publishing the results for all to see. This survey is anonymous and cannot be linked to your identity or your reddit account.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/q72s9/reurope_10000_subscribers_milestone_census_the/) are the survey results for the last 10,000 member survey.

Now I can't deny the usefulness of the many products from Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft etc, and of course we all voluntarily subscribe (well, some of it is peer pressure :) but it feels *wrong*.

There are some implications: like if your company has data stored in Google's product's up for scrutiny by whatever weird legal construct they manage to setup, or sometimes even not-so-legal. 

If you store your life in Facebook and Apple iCloud it's all there for USA's shady agencies to do with as they please. That secret plan for World Peace you stored on your Google Drive? They know all about it.

The people at /r/conspiracy will have a good time with this, but like they say, it's not paranoia if people *really* are out to get you.

I mean, *logically* I somehow understand it: stupid people elect terrible politicians everywhere on this planet. Just ask some of my fellow Germans who regularly vote (in the 5, sometimes up to 10 percent range) for neo-Nazi parties. So I'm not really interested in fingerpointing here. But I really can hardly believe that after all those years of corruption, personal embezzlement, borderline (and sometimes not even borderline, but straight up) criminal activities, and just general sleaziness this guy is still so well liked by so many Italians.

But since that's how democracy works, perhaps my real question should then be: do you, Italians on r/europe (which presumably means you're part of the higher educated fraction of Italian voters) have any idea how you can convince your countrymen to give up on this guy once and for all? I mean, I'm sort of liberal-bordering-on-conservative in my own leanings, but I would be much, *much* less concerned if you'd elect an oldschool communist government, compared to what I expect of another decade* of Berlusconi.

I was shocked to find **out of 219 failed, foiled or completed attacks in 2012 only six were found to be religiously inspired.** [Pg 42]

Whilst the UK does not publish the motivation of terrorism offenses all 24 of its offenses where committed in Northern Ireland. I'd take an educated guess and state that they are all to do with separatism with a few possibly religiously motivated.

The number of arrests do show a different picture though. Of the 537 total arrests 159 were for religiously inspired terrorism offenses (with the vast majority (91) of arrests taking place in France). [Pg 43] 

Finally I'd like to copy Europol's ""key judgement"" on religiously motivated terrorism.
&gt;The terrorist threat in the EU remains strong
and varied as indicated by an increase in the
number of attacks. The terrorist threat in the EU
remains diverse; there were 17 deaths as a result of terrorist
activity of all types in 2012, a steep rise in comparison to
the figure of two deaths reported last year1. The majority
of the fatalities were the result of two major terrorist incidents:
one bomb attack at Burgas airport in Bulgaria and
the three attacks committed by a solo terrorist in Toulouse
and Montauban in France. There were no attacks attributed
to ETA during 2012, continuing the general decrease from
the previous year. However, terrorist attacks by Dissident Republican
groups in Northern Ireland continued to feature
and included the murder of a prison officer. The merger
of a number of dissident republican factions in 2012 is of
concern. Although al-Qaeda’s organisational command and
control may have been severely weakened in recent years,
the threat from religiously inspired terrorism, especially to
soft targets, remains a key issue for the security of the EU
Member States and their interests abroad.

Before going on, I want to stress that every response is 100% anonymous. At a technical-level and a question-level. We don't ask you for your name, username, phone number, or anything like that. So, please be honest with your responses! Data is a beautiful thing, and the more we have of it, the better.

The survey consists of 4 pages, and will take less than 5 minutes to complete.

[LINK TO THE SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x_IVDw4OxAVJfJgRyFvuZZpkHxNif4MOoxHMcidDZZY/viewform)

We're going to let the survey run for about a month or until we get a number of responses that resemble the subscribers of the subreddit (unlikely). Whatever comes first. After the polling has been finished, I'm going to play with the data like the dirty data-loving whore I am, and produce some fun and interesting statistics. Perhaps maybe an infographic or two. And in the interest of transparency, we'll also release a .csv of responses, and the graphic representations of each question. That way, if anyone is interested, you can join me in my data orgy.

And finally, a personal request: On the last page you'll find a typical suggestion box for you to leave a comment or suggestion about the subreddit. Please use it! Every response will be read and considered. You're 100% anonymous, so don't hold back.

Thanks!

*Side note: You can change your responses after submitting as many times as you want before the survey closes down.*

How do people manage getting chores done that largely overlaps with their working time?,shenpen,267,33,243,http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/129tnc/why_is_the_western_european_service_industry/,"Where I am from (Hungary) lots of shops and services are open 10AM to 8PM, Saturday and often on Sunday too, and quite some are 7/24 - people need the money.

Living in Austria now I just have no idea who am I even supposed to manage my chores like getting a haircut, getting winter tires replaced, getting something fixed in the car, sort stuff out with the tax office (Finanzamt), go to the bank, wait for the chimney sweepers, wait for the guy repairing my heating, install UPC internet etc. and so on, almost everything is 8:00 -  17:00 open, i.e. **they re having the same working time as myself and their other customers!**.

How do people manage this? This is hugely inefficient, if you have a tolerant boss (I have) you can pop out for 1-2 hours to get such things done if they are near you (often not), but **it just can't be a business model that all your customers are asking to leave their work earlier/arrive later and/or take out holidays, now can it?**

I understand the counter-argument that these people want to live the same normal life with normal hours as myself, but I just don't understand the model. How are you supposed to get these things done in this model?

Can someone explain how most people manage it? Do they have a non-working spouse who arranges all this so they are still down to the old single-income family model? Or frequently take out 1-day get-stuff-done holidays?

I am not trying to complain, I am trying to figure out what kind of model did the people who designed this system had in mind and how it works! For example if you work at a 08:00 - 17:00 car repair workshop or barber shop, what is the general customer model in your mind i.e. how exactly do you think your customers are able to come to you at say 14:00?",,False,,t5_2qh4j,False,,,True,t3_129tnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/129tnc/why_is_the_western_european_service_industry/,

Now, i'm quite certain we all thought the same thing when we saw this video. Disgust at the stupidity of the people rioting. However, that video was 2 years old, had no discussion-value whatsoever, and was posted by NiggerJew944, a member who posts almost nothing but videos and comments pointing out negative things about muslims and blacks. His contributions have no discussional value whatsoever, and focuses only on one ethnicity. It is pure propaganda. Yet he still gets a large amount of upvotes.

Lately, this subreddit have seen a large influx of videos and links of this character. Posts that simply appeal to our bigotry, but hold no value in a rational discussion, nor is particularily related to Europe at all.

What i have also noticed, is that it seems to be becoming socially acceptable to be bigoted and prejudice in this subreddit. A while back, there was a post about a gang of youths gang-raping a french girl. The comment section was filled with comments who, without any evidence whatsoever, immediately blamed the muslims. 

Right or wrong, we don't know, but anybody who tried to debate this assumption was immediately downvoted far beyond the threshold.

This is very similar to the behaviour of people from another big subreddit, r/atheism. A Place completely void of any rational thinking or constructive discussion. You either agree, or you get ""removed"". A behaviour which also holds similarities with the Muslim extremists who cannot tolerate any opinion other than their own. 

Areas where people can be bigoted without any reprecaussions or challenging opinions at all is a very effective breeding ground for extremists. The same goes for the Internet, as for the Middle East, and i will be using the swedish forum Flashback.org as a perfect example of this.

Flashback have been completely taken over by the Anti-islamic circlejerk. 7/10 of the Hot-Topics of the day at any given time are or become anti-islamic. Rape is a frequent subject, but only the ones where an immigrant is responsible gets attention. There is no constructive debate or rational thinking anywhere. 

Words like ""Sand-nigger"", ""Cultural-enrichers"" and ""Camel-fuckers"" are used as casually as the word ""Muslim"". People have Breivik as their avatars, and celebrate him in their signatures without anybody questioning it.

Anybody who doesn't agree  have left the site in pure disgust, which only serves to increase the circlejerk. Now the racists and bigots can speak without anybody opposing them, allowing them to dig further into their bigotry unopposed, thinking that everybody agrees with them.

Just like /r/atheism in regards to religion, and just like extremist muslims in the middle-east. Ofcourse there are major differences, especially in regards to how violence is seen. But the general mindset of intolerance is similar.

This sort of behaviour is extremely devastating, since it makes it completely impossible to hold civilized discussions. And i feel that it is in a similar direction that this subreddit is heading, when anybody who posts anti-muslim propaganda is celebrated, and anyone who opposes, regardless of how constructive or rational they are, get downvoted.

We must be better at distinguishing propaganda from something that actually holds a value for a discussion. Of course we should discuss islam, if it is relevant. The protests against the muhammed video held discussional value.
But we shouldn't just post videos of muslims being generally stupid like the above mentioned video. It contributes nothing and serves only to damage the quality of the subreddit.

Nor should we allow ourselves to be taken over by emotions to the degree where a proper debate becomes impossible. When comments saying ""[Fucking disgusting muslim retards](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11t851/riot_at_a_swedish_film_screening_depicting/c6phbwe)"" gets upvoted, while a long and well formulated argument gets downvoted. It's an extremely immature mindset and we are better than that.

In order to stop this subreddit from becoming one massive anti-islamic circlejerk, then we need to start filtering out content that is relevant to the subreddit, and downvote that which isn't. Regardless what you think of the video, don't upvote it if it holds no discussional value. The video was reposted at /r/atheism, where it was much more related. Keep it there.

If we allow content like that on this subreddit and upvote it, then the subreddit will end just like Flashback or /r/atheism.",,False,,t5_2qh4j,False,,SWED,True,t3_11w8lc,http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11w8lc/on_the_increase_of_antiislamic_posts_and_the/,

A troubled guy came to talk to the Prime Minister (PM) on Turku market square, and fell on his knees in front of the PM, and presented the PM a kitchen knife by laying the knife on the ground, saying ""you may as well kill me here"".

Unfortunately, [Helsingin Sanomat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingin_Sanomat), the largest newspaper in Finland, at first only had information along the lines ""guy, knife, prime minister, something happened"", and they erroneously reported about a knife attack.

Several international news, such as [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20031494), picked quickly up the false reporting by Helsingin Sanomat, and the story is unlikely to be corrected outside Finland any more; people will believe that a knife attack happened.

So after running for about a month, the survey has finally ended. A big thank you to all subscribers who took time out of their day to fill it out. Also, thank you to everyone left suggestions in the original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gsyku/the_official_reurope_30k_subscribers_survey/) and in the survey itself.

Without further ado:

[THE SURVEY RESULTS](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x_IVDw4OxAVJfJgRyFvuZZpkHxNif4MOoxHMcidDZZY/viewanalytics)

For those of you who are budding karma entrepreneurs, you can find a CSV containing all the responses [here](http://www.sendspace.com/file/3p7527). I look forward to seeing creative uses come out of the data (I'm looking at you, /r/MapPorn users). Note that the CSV does not contain the anonymous suggestions, as keeping those in there could have been potentially identifying when combined with responses to other questions. In the interest of transparency, though, you can still see an aggregate of all the suggestions in the main results link.

As mods, we're currently looking over each and every suggestion now, but it's going to take a bit of time before we discuss and implement anything concrete. However, with that said, three recent pieces of news:

* You can now see /r/europe's traffic stats [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/about/traffic/).

* Thanks to some of your suggestions, starting next week we are introducing two new weekly series. The first one, Round Table, is a weekly poll and serious discussion on a relevent topic of interest. The polls will always be very short, just asking for nationality and your stance on the topic at hand. But more importantly, while the discussion is happening, the poll's results will always be viewable and hopefully this will add some flair to the discussion. This thread will run every Monday, and the first topic will be Scotland's independence. Topics are chosen by users in /r/europe's IRC channel (information in the sidebar).

* The second one, Melting Pot Friday, is silly and just for fun. Posted every Friday, it's a light-hearted and general discussion thread where you are encouraged to post in your native tongue. For those of you studying another language, it could be a good way to practice what you know!

Here's why I will be voting to *stay in* the union if/when the referendum comes. ,Aethelstan,280,89,390,http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16zgox/im_a_eurosceptic_heres_why_i_will_be_voting_to/,"Firstly, I need to get something straight. Just because I'm anti-EU, it doesn't mean that I'm anti-European. I love Europe. I holiday there often and I dream of moving to either France or Spain sometime soon. 

However, I don't believe that the EU is what is best for Europe. I think that it is an undemocratic behemoth that is stifling competitiveness and creativity, inexorably pulling us down as a continent with respect to much of the rest of the world. I think that the world is changing so rapidly now, with the advent of the internet and the ""global village"", and that centralised governments cannot adapt fast enough to keep pace. 

That said, I will be voting to stay in. Solidarity with Europe means more to me. I don't think that Britain can change the way the EU is going, and I don't want us to be left out. Europe is part of our family, and I want to go with them even though I think that it is the wrong road we're taking. I'll still argue against the EU in theoretical arguments, but ultimately I'll not stand in its way.

Edit (3 hours in): I must say I'm a little disappointed that the majority of you have missed the point of this post. Very few of you actually gleaned the positive side, and only concentrated on the anti-EU argument. This was an opportunity to show your magnanimity, to reach out to the British, but you've just used it as a platform for your well-rehearsed pro-EU speeches.",,False,,t5_2qh4j,1358781982.0,,FRAN,True,t3_16zgox,http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16zgox/im_a_eurosceptic_heres_why_i_will_be_voting_to/,

I will not argue for, or against austerity measures here. I only ask we try and keep the discussions from derailing to a moralistic mentality of who is to blame and who gets to fuck whom in what orifice, and focus on whether the proposed solutions **actually** help put an economy back on a sustainable path (even in the long run) or not.

In Romania, the political class is trying their best to prevent an alternative to them (they've discussed how a two-party system is ""better for Romania""):

* to register a party, you need 25.000 signatures, uniformly from all the country (at least 1.000 signature from 18 counties), headquarters in over 20 counties, etc.
* a party is automatically disbanded if it doesn't participate in elections or if it does participate and it doesn't get enough votes in an election
* in order to participate in the elections at national level, a party must pay 2355 minimum monthly wages (a bit over 400.000€).
* an independent candidate loses automatically if he/she doesn't get over 50% of the votes in the district, regardless of how many votes the rest got.
* even though it's supposed to be a first-past-the-post system, there's also a election threshold of 5%, so if your party's candidates win some districts, they won't get in the parliament if the party didn't get more than that threshold.

The result is that practically, in most places, there are only three candidates of those big (and atrociously corrupt) parties:

* PSD -- Social Democrats -- practically, neoliberals; they want privatization of railroads, energy and parts of the healthcare system (but not the emergency system, like PDL)
* PDL -- Democratic-Liberals -- they have some libertarian ideas, but only regarding the economy, not social issues; they want to ""privatize"" the primary school system with a ""voucher system""
* PP-DD -- People's Party -- some idiotic nationalist party, founded by a talk show host at a gutter press TV station

 &gt; Dear Mr [Stillwater],
 &gt; 
 &gt; My colleague Syed Kamall is shadowing this dossier for the Conservatives
in the European Parliament and has provided the following response to me
for your attention:
 &gt; 
 &gt; ""Thank you for your email. I am replying on behalf of all three London
Conservative MEPs.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I have received a number of claims about ACTA and am currently in
discussions with the European Commission and MEPs across the political
spectrum to verify these claims. I share your concerns over claims that
ACTA will force ISPs to enforce intellectual property rights and police
their users.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I will do what I can to ensure that ACTA does not undermine the
democratic values which we all hold dear"".
 &gt; 
 &gt; To raise your concerns on this issue, under the European Parliament's
Rules of Procedure (Rule 117, 1,) I have also tabled a parliamentary
question on your behalf to The European Commission regarding ACTA.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I expect to hear from the European Commission in due course (rule 117, 4) and the reply will be posted on my website. http://www.marinayannakoudakis.com/ . Questions posed and answers received are also published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Here are the [raw numbers](http://i.imgur.com/fs1Gf2M.png).

This is the EU spending divided by annual GDP. The goal is to give a little perspective to everyone about how much their country ""sacrifices"" for the EU, especially if they are net contributors.

The data is from 2011. The spendings data comes from [there](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-interactive-money), the GDP from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29) (IMF column), the $/€ conversion rate from [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%E2%82%AC+to+%24+in+2011).

Here is the spreadsheet: [ODS format](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/94009/EU%20spendings%202011.ods), [XLS format](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/94009/EU%20spendings%202011.xls). Note that I made this with LibreOffice, so the XLS export can be buggy.

EDIT: As asked, [here it is](http://i.imgur.com/wQGAS2I.png) with horizontal bars and sorted by GDP. [The ODS file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/94009/EU%20spendings%202011%20horizontal.ods).

EDIT2: I thought it would also be interesting to see it compared to the government budget. [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/yiP9fZn.png). Here are the [raw numbers](http://i.imgur.com/7SetV2D.png). [The file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/94009/EU%20spendings%202011%20by%20gov%20budget.ods). The data comes from [there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_budgets_by_country).

EDIT3: As suggested, [here](http://i.imgur.com/YhU85G5.png) is a chart of the personal contributions in €, sorted by GDP for consistency. [The file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/94009/EU%20contribution%20per%20person.ods).

It is expected that the European Parliament will vote in June. I will be voting against the agreement. The French MEP responsible for scrutinising the agreement for the Parliament has now quit the process, angry that the EU has now signed the agreement in a symbolic ceremony. He feels the Parliament's role has been undermined.

Our group also commissioned a study on the compatibility of ACTA with the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The study underlines concerns that the ACTA agreement violates fundamental rights. As such, I believe that the EU and its member states cannot ratify the agreement and have a duty to scrap the ACTA agreement as it stands. The study is available at:

I'm interested if there's a similar situation elsewhere in Europe. So here goes...

My uncle Radomir, the poor guy, died for a daily wage of 1000 dinars (8,7 EUR). No one works in the family, they're all poor, like most people here in the south - tells us Boban, nephew of Radomir Dejković (65) from Gornja Trebišnja, one of the three laborers that died yesterday in Bzovik.

Radomir Dejković, Aleksandar Begović (55) and Dobrila Kočić (56) died when their truck accidentally switched into reverse and fell down a cliff. Poverty forced them to work as laborers at an old age, far from their home.

-Because of that poverty he left to Golija to pick potatoes. He hoped to make money so his family could survive. He worked there for three weeks, and before that he worked as a laborer in Vranje for 500-1000 dinars a day, or sometimes even a bag of beans or some cheese, just so he could feed his family - Radomir's nephew tells us.

Dobrila's husband died four years ago. They didn't have children or close relatives in the village. During winter she sometimes got social welfare, and during summer she worked as a laborer. She went to pick cherries, raspberries, plums... all day she worked for 500-1000 dinars. From the money she made from picking cherries she fixed her shed, so that her firewood wouldn't get wet during the winter, and from this last wage she planned to fix her ceiling, which recently collapsed over her bed and injured her leg. She was afraid the snow might destroy her weathered house since she had nowhere else to go - Milena Rašić, one of the neighbors tells us. Milena's uncle is Aleksandar, one of the people that died in the accident.

Another neighbor, Zorica Đorđević, tells us that her electricity was cut because of unpaid bills, so she lived in the dark. She planned to pay the bills when she got money from social welfare. Vesna Milošević, a far cousin says that Dobrila was refused for social help for the next three months.

-Aleksandar first went to pick potatoes. During summer we picked apples in Kelebia. Seasonal work was our only income - says Bojana Mustafić, the wife of the deceised who lives with her daughter and two grandsons in a small house.

Aleksandar used to work in the factories ""Merima"", ""Fabrika ulja"" and in the Kruševac municipality, and in the last few years he was doing seasonal jobs.",,False,,t5_2qh4j,1348913586.0,,VOJV,True,t3_10nur6,http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10nur6/3_workers_killed_in_serbia/,

I have visited Copenhagen, London, Paris and Switzerland. I met up with redditors in all these great places and they have been the coolest people I have ever met! 

I got a free tour from a redditor in East London. I partied with redditors at the Distortion Festival in Copenhagen. I met up with the awesome redditors in Zurich and went swimming in the lake. I met the redditors in Basel and they took me to a cool nightclub. I met the London Social Club and played drunken bingo at a giant warehouse party.

Today I picked up my motorcycle from storage in Biarritz France. Tomorrow I start my motorcycle journey and I have no idea where I am going next.

Tell me where to go and I will go there!

A few rules:

I want to go towards Eastern Europe eventually. I need to stop bleeding money in the expensive parts of Europe and I have always wanted to see Eastern Europe.

No dangerous areas please. I am pretty badass but I am don't consider getting mugged exciting.

I am a newbie motorcycle rider. Please don't invite me to go to the top of the Matterhorn.

If you have a couch for me then I am 90% already there. I started a couchsurfing.org profile and have started using it for this summer. I will PM it to you with more info if you want. I am super low maintenance and would be happy with anything.

Make me an offer I can't refuse /r/europe!

UPDATE:

Wow! So many responses while I was sleeping. When do you people sleep?! I will read them all and reply as quickly as I can before my hotel kicks me out. It looks like a lot of suggestions and some couch offers. Couch offers be prepared for me to PM and probably show up :)

UPDATE #2:

WOW! So many awesome replies. Thank you so much to everyone for the advice and invitation. If I said I would PM you I will PM you soon. I am a little exhausted right now becuase I had my first day of riding today. It was great. I made it to Pau, France and stumbled upon Suaveterre and the Château de Laas along the way. This is why I love doing this. I never know what I will find. You are awesome /r/europe.

The police took them to Bromma airport in Stockholm, and then stood aside as masked alleged CIA operatives cut their clothes from their bodies, inserted drugged suppositories in their anuses, and dressed them in diapers and overalls, handcuffed and chained them and put them on an executive jet with American registration N379P. They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to an extensive investigate reports by Swedish programme ""Kalla fakta"". A Swedish Parliamentary investigator concluded that the degrading and inhuman treatment of the two prisoners violated Swedish law. In 2006 the United Nations found Sweden had violated an international torture ban in its complicity in the CIA's transfer of al-Zari to Egypt. Sweden imposed strict rules on rendition flights, but Swedish Military Intelligence posing as airport personnel who boarded one of two subsequent extraordinary rendition flights in 2006 during a stopover at Stockholm’s Arlanda International Airport found the Swedish restrictions were being ignored. In 2008 the Swedish government awarded al-Zery $500,000 in damages for the abuse he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.

Thank you for your email, I fully share your concerns and wholeheartedly
object to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). I am concerned
that ACTA will impair civil liberties and access to information and
medicines. ACTA also urgently needs to be improved in the areas of
copyright and patent enforcement.

I am also critical of the ACTA negotiations. Plaid Cymru's group
requested a Parliamentary resolution demanding legal clarification from
the European Court of Justice on the negotiations and content of ACTA.
This request unfortunately failed as it was deemed premature for us to
ask the ECJ for an opinion when ACTA has not yet been formally submitted
to the Parliament for approval. We will be using this time before the
formal submission to persuade our colleagues that such a clarification
from the ECJ is necessary.

Our group also commissioned a study on the compatibility of ACTA with
the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights. The study underlines concerns that the ACTA
agreement violates fundamental rights. As such, I believe that the EU
and its member states cannot ratify the agreement and have a duty to
scrap the ACTA agreement as it stands. The study is available at:

http://www.greens-efa.eu/fileadmin/dam/Documents/Studies/ACTA_fundamental_rights_assessment.pdf

It is expected that the European Parliament will vote in March. I will
be voting against the agreement.

Best wishes,
Jill

[Belgium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) is one of the younger kingdoms in Europe and recently celebrated the succession in the royal line. Trying to exist between major European powers it was historically run over.

I don't have so much time so I will probably make more for some of the other questions tomorrow.

As I am not an artist, please do not expect these maps to be the best. If anybody can do a better job, please do so :)

For each question, I made a script that produces two different types of map: A 'gradient map' and a 'traffic-light map'.

All of the maps are based around the **total average**. On the 'traffic-light map', the pinkish colour shows that it's below average, yellowish shows that it's ""more or less"" average and the blue colour shows above average. On the gradient map, darker is below average and lighter is above average. So bear in mind, even if your country shows up as below average, you may even support it 'overall' (ie: above 3 on the census).

Long story short, I made these in my free time and I understand that it's impossible to make a map/colours that everyone can agree with, so just.. enjoy.. or don't :D

As you all remember, the following questions were met with a lot of approval in general. These are also the sort of questions I had in mind when I made the algorithm to compare against averages. In the following maps, negative (Pinkish) countries do not necessarily mean that they are against it, but that they are less enthusiastic about it than the rest, or that they are split on the issue and several people voted low from those countries.

Made a few more 'alleged traffic light with wrong colours' maps. I will probably remake the gradient map slightly and re-do them when I get some time, perhaps when everything is finished I may create an album as suggested. No promises ;) Enjoy.

While I read a fair bit on my own and had a solid, non-jingoistic high school history teacher, I had absolutely no idea that we put the British in debt for helping them during WWII. 

Interestingly in China, WWII is called ""The War of Japanese Aggression"" in which China is the primary force that defeats Japan. This is apparently part of the Communist Party's legitimacy - that the Red Army were responsible for saving the country, which partially explains why the Party still stokes nationalist anger against Japan today.

People can apply for Hungarian citizenship under the relaxed procedure since January 3rd, 2011. According to the law, people that had Hungarian citizenship before 1920 or between 1938 and 1945, or their descendents, may be eligeable for citizenship if they can speak Hungarian and don't have a criminal record. The applications don't need to have a residence in Hungary, they don't need to provide proof of funds or knowledge of the constitution, which are conditions for those applying through the regular procedure.

The new procedure has caused some tensions in the neighboring countries fearing separatism among their ethnic Hungarian minorities. The most extreme case is Slovakia where those who receive Hungarian citizenship are automatically stripped of their Slovakian one. This explains the very low number of applications from Slovakia, compared to the minority population in that country (458 thousand).

Gaining Hungarian citizenship is a symbolic act for most minority Hungarians.
