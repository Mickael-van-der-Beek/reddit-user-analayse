Do not go to /r/music if you want to discuss rap music. 

This is a small slice of this website, even at nearly 70k people that listen to rap music. Be it Gucci Mane, Kanye West, Atmosphere, Joey Bada$$ etc, people here actually listen to this genre and for the most part understand it. 

I don't like Joey Bada$$ myself but dude can rap, he just isn't my shit. The rest of this website as a whole, if they don't like something it's the worst thing ever, you're an idiot for liking it, how dare you have not spent 10 years getting a degree in music theory in order to be a barista. Then there's the element of racism.

If you're not white you already know this for certain and even if you are white (murdahmamurdah's census showed most of us are in fact the white devil) you probably know this. Wayne is to most of this site a guy who rhymes nigga with nigga. There's no understanding of his body of work and contributions to the game. He's the *bad* kind of black person, the kind that groups of white males drop hard r's on in their dorm rooms while playing League of Legends together, when they feel safe enough to be racist idiots. 

You don't have to like Wayne, like most people I haven't liked his music for a minute now but if you have any respect for this genre of music you know Wayne did work. There's a difference between not liking someone's music and understanding they have impacted the music even if you aren't nodding your head. 

This is a music sub, we talk about music and musicians. If the worst thing Wayne has done is say some stupid shit about the NBA, worn some terrible leopard print pants or dropped some pauseworthy lines comparing pussy to pimples then that's really not that bad, it's certainly not grounds to cheer and hope for the death of another human being. Be easy motherfuckers, respect the community we have here, respect the fact this place exists and you can come here and upvote an Atmosphere song and a Gucci song on the same front page and you don't have to see a bunch of memes and reddit bs.

Constantly walking the line between the underground arena and the mainstream DOOM boasts one of the best discographies in Hip-Hop. His unique rapid-fire approach to rapping along with his lyrical content and beat selection make DOOM one of the greatest MCs of all time.

**Mr. Hood (1991)** Mr. Hood features the earliest incarnation of DOOM, Zev Love X, along with his younger brother DJ Subroc and Onyx. Mr.Hood, is a Public Enemy-esque politically aggressive raw album. The album focused on the sociological problems and environments  plaguing African-American youth. I apologize for not including this initially.

Standout Tracks

* [Peachfuzz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3GgAALPkQ)

* [Who Me?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYxks-1UVM) ""...they always try to say that coon is me for some reason""

* [Figure of Speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Lp0P-mIRU) ""The motto goes: sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. I prefer: love, hugs and hip hop soul.""

**Black Bastards (2001)** The album was scheduled to be released in 1993 as a follow-up to Mr.Hood however its lyrical content as well as its [controversial cover art](http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/82258689/Black+Bastards+KMD.png) led to its release being cancelled by Elektra Records. The album was held back for nearly a decade and sadly Dingilizwe Dumile (DJ Subroc) DOOM's fellow group member and younger brother died after being struck by a car. Pulling various elements from Public Enemy,NWA, and A Tribe Called Quest with his deep commanding and refined voice effortlessly gliding over the beats this album was were we saw Zev begin to make the transition to DOOM.

* [Black Bastards!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5sOUtglp_M) ""See I became undergorund like the life in the street""

* [What a Niggy Know?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2XnostL51o) After listening to this you'll understand why Elektra dropped the release

* [It Sounded Like A Roc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niMmltuDaio) This song doesn't actually have Zev on it I just really enjoy it. RIP Subroc    

**Operation: Doomsday (1999)** was DOOMs return to Hip-Hop after the end of his days in [KMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMD) and the death of his brother. Moreover was his first solo work. Throughout the album skits are interwoven between the songs DO NOT SKIP THEM. For the sake of your first listen don't skip any skits they blend so well with the rest of tracks (which few rappers even accomplish successfully) and create a story and not just any story, the Story of the Man, The Myth, The Villain. This album boasts a wide variety of beats ranging from soul samples to the Scooby Doo theme song.

* [Hey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBr1ebmBjME)

**Take Me to Your Leader (2003)** is my personal favorite. This time DOOM is under the guise of King Geedorah. The entire album was produced and written by DOOM. People are often fixated on DOOMs style they tend to overlook his skills as a producer. The beats are amazing and each song shifts to the next smoothly and effortlessly.

Standout Tracks

* [The Fine Print](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsdW63DxPUw) These Fan-made music videos just blow me away sometimes.

* [Fazers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRn9BRo4Igw)

* [Krazy World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7HfrpW3YCo)

**Vaudeville Villain/Venomous Villain (2003/2004)** I'm putting these two albums together for the sake of time cause I have to be at work in a little bit. Vaudeville illustrates the everyday life of Viktor Vaughn through his daily activities including drug dealing, mad sciencestry, and various villainous acts. This incarnation of DOOM is more raunchy armed with a sharper wit he flawlessly shifts from serious metaphors and idioms to obscurely hilarious pop culture references. Venomous is my least favorite DOOM album however by no means is it a bad album. It was released as a followup to Vaudeville. DOOM pulled out an arsenal of underground producers for this one. Honestly until your DOOM palate is refined I wouldn't recommend Venomous.

Standout Tracks

* [Vaudeville Villain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex7QpLrhgvw)

* [Lactose And Lecithin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J856D1hd8bo)

* [Saliva](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxcqTiLVYa0)  

**Madvilliany (2004)** I take it back this is my favorite DOOM project. This album marked DOOMs entrance into the eye of the mainstream. It was critically acclaimed and even to this day i'm still shocked it was not even considered for a Grammy. This time around DOOM brings in his old buddy and legend in his own right Madlib to handle the production. If you're new to rap entirely start here besides the Mouse and The Mask this is DOOM's most accessible album. Lyrically this is the some of DOOM's best work and the beats only build on top of that. Once again I beg you DON'T SKIP THE SKITS.

* [Accordian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trGxAEH8kKA) On a rainy day turn off all your lights and listen to this song. Shit is just indescribable. [The Roots and Weird Al also covered this](https://soundcloud.com/znaki-fm/the-roots-weird-al-yankovic)

* [Raid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weWTuvdL-LQ) If you're wondering why this song is familiar you probably watch The Boondocks

* [All Caps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewc1hixzYPY) 'Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name!!!""

**The Mouse and The Mask (2005)** If you've ever watched Adult Swim you'll be familiar with some of these songs whether you realize it or not. Born from the labors of producer Danger Mouse (Gorillaz, The Grey Album, Gnarls Barkley, etc) and DOOM comes the Mouse and The Mask an alternative rap album encompassing elements of Adult Swim programs and Hip-Hop. The skits on this one are woven into the songs themselves albeit a bit corny the first listen they begin to grow on you. This album is very accessible for those who want to make the transition to the church Hip-Hopology. There was also a follow-up to this called [Occult Hymn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult_Hymn) has some cool remixes of songs on the original album (Space Ho's and Sofa King notably) and a couple new songs good not great.

* [Benzie Box ft. Cee-Lo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM7yVtd32LQ) The hook is crazy Cee-Lo delivers. DOOM has solid lines. Some say that this song was what led to the inception of [Gnarls Barkley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnarls_Barkley)

* [Basket Case](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzvfiOn7L5I) They still play this instrumental on Adult Swim bumps.

* [Mince Meat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIggvDVt_eU) ""...the flow of the lyrics to the beat are amazing, and the chained theme of cartoon characters too. He's saying, whatever you're out for, if you're looking to employ the services of DOOM, just offer him up DAT/that (dual meaning!!) tape of any kind of music and he'll make mince meat out of it; it'll be no effort for him to turn it into a sick beat, something he's done with a lot of different types of music over time on different albums and collaborations, referencing the variety of his work."" -/u/Tashre

* [Space Ho's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz9AfrfZYUE) ""Yeah America's cravin some Doom, here you go""

**Mm...Food (2004)** a true followup to Operation: Doomsday this album is more mellow than his previous endeavors. Boasting a considerably diverse array of samples DOOM is still the same old DOOM however this time he's not out to conquer the world he simply creates hilarious and intelligent lyrics with clever one-liners. In my opinion this is the most quotable DOOM album.

* [Beef Rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_7O7emrF6A)

* [Vomitspit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEjZItfWReM) ""Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho""

**Born Like This (2009)** DOOM's most recent solo album. I felt it was a tad bit overlooked. While not being the critic pleasing debut that Operation:DD was or the triumphant return that was Mm...Food Born Like This is still a solid album. Nothing amazing but far far from bad.

* [Microwave Mayo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfIeHx0ISXg)

* [Yessir! ft. Raekwon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emrUrlDDCK8) DOOM knows how to pick features!

* [ Cellz Ft.Charles Bukowski](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQMHHfolpxQ)

**JJ DOOM-Keys to the Kuffs (2012)** DOOM teamed up with producer Jneiro Jarel to create this album. The production on this one shifts oddly from somewhat smooth head bobbable tunes to raunchy and bizarre beats. DOOM's flow is just as prominent and commanding as ever. As always the lyrical aspect of this album is amazing almost emulating his Operation:Doomsday Era.

* [Winter Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO-nMWkoJFs) ""Learn to balance, it's real tricky
Like The Incredible Hulk turned back to Bill Bixby"" My personal fav off the album

**Special Herbs** is basically a series of instrumentals by DOOM. Can't believe i left this out forgive me /u/maxxramman. There are A LOT of tracks in this series. You won't truly appreciate these until you become a full fledged DOOM fan in my opinion. 

* [Lemon Grass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvbfEjv8HY0) Sounds like a leftover from Operation:DD

* [Orange Blossoms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcylRFqJEmA) Makes me feel like I'm at a Spa 

**GG DOOM-BUT HOW?!?!? (2013)** not technically an album by DOOM. An amateur producer named Grip-Grand pulled verses from various DOOM songs and placed them over his own beats. It's so good you can hardly tell its not an official album. The instrumentals are just fantastic Grip knows his shit.

I decided to make this guide to help people who are interested in Wayne but don't know what projects or songs are worth listening to. I also partly decided to do this to help newcomers realize that Wayne for quite a long period of time was without question ""The Best Rapper Alive."" And there's a whole lot of blind hate towards Lil Wayne, so hopefully this post at least helps those people understand what they are hating.


**Tha Carter I** was Wayne's fist big solo project. This is what put him on the rap radar and really displayed his skills as an MC. The intro track ""Walk In"" introduces you to Wayne and gives you a preview of what the album will be about, but at the same time introduces the topics as a metaphor for a house tour. Overall Wayne sounds really hungry on this project, he was pretty much doing abysmal sales numbers before this album and he is rapping like he's the new guy on the scene that's trying to prove he deserves a spot in the rap game.

Standout Tracks

*  [Walk In](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2vHvonHQaE)
*  [Go DJ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNS-Ho5tWo0)
*  [BM J.r.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TkWgSfs1jE)

**Tha Carter II** is also really good, I definitely recommend listening to that front to back. A lot of the production is really advanced for its time too. I think this was the first project that Wayne did without Mannie Fresh producing it, and holy shit it is leaps and bounds ahead of the Mannie era beats and mixing.

**Dedication 2** Wayne's flow is unbelievable, swagger is nearing Jay-Z ""I hang out with the President"" levels, and Weezy sounds like he isn't even fucking trying. He's got you listening in for every word so you can appreciated the dopeness and at the same time giving you the feeling that he might just doze off on lean before he finishes the next bar.

Best Songs

*  [Get Em](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkSXuYq9OdE)
*  [They Still Like Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiERlgbXaWE) poor mixing but oh my god the dude isn't even trying and it's dope as fuck.

* [Cannon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBmHkZCcqyE)
* [Ambitionz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2lz_pzur5I)

**Da Drought 3** is hands down The Best Lil Wayne project. Best flows of his career, wordplay is great, and my god his delivery... You can't spit like him no matter how many times you listen to this mixtape. Plus it has a couple references to the Wayne kissing Birdman picture that came out a few weeks before Da Drought 3 dropped. Pretty much every song on this mixtape has at least one line that's been referenced by a post 2008 rapper (Cole, Drake, Alex Wiley, Big Sean, Flatbush Zombies, Plus a lot of Chance's vocal delivery is identical to Wayne's on this tape.)

Best Songs

*  [Live From The 504](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfbF34LQn7Y) THE BEST SONG WAYNE HAS EVER DONE
*  [Intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4Z8-wDjaAs)

*  [Sky is The Limit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjbXUvLyXA) ""When I was 5 my favorite movie was the Gremlins, that ain't got shit to do with this I just thought that I should mention""

**Da Drought is Over 2** If my memory serves me correctly this was the original draft of Tha Carter III but a number of tracks got leaked onto the internet. Then the Wayne camp decided to release the entire album for free. This mixtape is definitely not as refined as Tha Carter III was but he still has a perfected delivery.

* [I Feel Like Dying](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuyEgvCVYd8) 
* [I Know The Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53jbwObetQ) How the fuck can he do that with his voice.
* [What He Does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA5UFZA5EA8) A rare relationship song from Wayne, and he does it well. Actually gives a great look into the personal life of Wayne, he doesn't stray from the topic and he doesn't brag, he just talks about the difficulties of maintaining a relationship as a rapper.

**Tha Carter III** has the best production out of any of Wayne's albums. He takes beats from lesser known producers (Deezle, Maestro,Play-N-Skillz) and big names like Kanye West, Swizz Beatz, Cool &amp; Dre, and Alchemist and blends it into a really diverse but cohesive album. Wayne does some really cool things with his delivery on his album that sounds a little more refined than the earlier mixtapes. Gotta say it's one of the best things Weezy has ever put out plus it has the best album cover.

Best songs

* [Mr. Carter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjfldb1r0jE) Song has Jay-Z passing the torch to Lil Wayne and basically calling him the new king of rap.
* [A Milli](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xVwaO6VXfU) If you graduated high school anywhere between 2009-2012 you probably know all the words to the first verse.
* [Got Money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ohYsK5Y8Dc) This song is basically an exact replica of Good Life by Kanye West but I think Wayne's version is better.
* [Dr. Carter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh0DNuv8kMo) Concept song where Wayne plays a doctor reviving hip hop.
* [Lollipop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IH8tNQAzSs) Everyone hates on this song because the auto tune, but I think the beat alone makes the song worth a listen.

**Dedication 3** is the beginning of the Autotunechi era, and at this point he is pretty much a part of Dipset. He still has some of his most original flows on this. But as a whole, not really something you have to listen to because there are far too many features the detract from the project if you're not a fan of Dipset (sorry murdah).

Best Tracks

* [Bang Bang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JkuQSdDLPU)
* [Stuntin ft. Drake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZKEFMgVT-M)

**No Ceilings** is the go to Wayne project if you wanna hear him straight rapping. The dude took the hottest summer songs and ripped through them for 5 minutes with no chorus and very few features. Wayne dropped this project in 2009 right after his horrid rock song ""Prom Queen"" came out. He raps on No Ceilings like he has something to prove to the world because he did. This is the first time in his career that he really sounds hungry since Tha Carter II. A lot of people consider this one of his best projects for this reason, but imo Wayne's at his best when he's comfortable and confident. And on this tape, through all his boasting and metaphors, he seems... vulnerable and insecure. He sounds like he is scared that his spot might be taken and that he must prove to himself that he still is ""The Best Rapper Alive"".

Best tracks on No Ceilings are

* [Swag Surfin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMn8cqd_2Qs)
* [Ice Cream Paint Job](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Cr1_p40jk)
* [Watch My Shoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaAtA3hjO4)


**Tha Carter IV** is not the most consistant Wayne album. The guy put out a few bangers on this one but there are some tracks on here that are so terrible you never wanna listen to Carter IV again(the T-pain song and the Bruno Mars song). Wayne has this interlude element of the album that I found really interesting, he raps over the Intro and then throughout the album he allows ~10 other rappers to try to body him on the same beat. Normally I'm not a big fan of tons of features on an album because it usually takes away from what the main artist is trying to say, but damn this Interlude idea was executed perfectly. It's Wayne fresh out of jail trying to see if he still has the skills to compete with the top guys in rap, and I think he does an okay job. But as a whole this album has like 4 hype songs that are worth keeping in rotation, the interludes, and the rest is really really forgettable. 

Best Songs

* [6 Foot 7 Foot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tOAGY59uQ) ""Real G's move in silence like lasagna""
* [Blunt Blowin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCfzBzJyJQ) ""Still got da vision like a line between two dots""
* [Mega Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euemXYFym9o)
* [All the Interlude verses](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYmaJeGoDl0) 3 Stacks does his thing on here but I think Tech N9ne has the best verse on this beat.

**Dedication 4** seems to be super slept on by /r/hhh but I think it's one of his better projects. Basically Wayne gets in the booth and tells you jokes for 75% of the album and then tells you to buy truckfit for the other 25%. I really enjoy this mixtape.

Instead of reviewing each song individually it should be viewed as a whole. By doing this you'd see that Yeezus is actually about Kanye giving us a dirty, gritty, no holds bar retelling of his realizations during his rise to fame starting with ""Black Skinhead"", ending with present Kanye actually beginning to find a bit of peace in ""Bound 2"". (I view ""On Sight"" as more as an intro).

I'll break down the album track by track. Feel free to tell me if you disagree or think I'm reading too much into the album.

* **Black Skinhead** - This song portrays Kaye's thirst to be on top specifically the hook which includes the lines *Four in the morning, and I'm zoning | They say I'm possessed, it's an omen | I keep it 300, like the Romans | 300 bitches, where's the Trojans? | Baby we living in the moment | I’ve been a menace for the longest | But I ain't finished, I'm devoted | And you know it, and you know it.* This is Kanye specifically talking about his old self, the man who was up at four AM grinding making beats in order to make it as an artist.

* **I am a God** - This song is Kanye's ego mid-career (think Hurricane Katrina incident).  He's basically on a high, everyone is bumping his shit and the industry thinks anything he touches is gold. The lines *I just talked to Jesus | He said, ""What up Yeezus?"" | I said, ""Shit I'm chilling | Trying to stack these millions"" | I know he the most high | But I am a close high | Mi casa es su casa | That's that cosa nostra | I am a God | I am a God | I am a God* Seem to signify how he started his initial rise into industry godhood through the song ""Jesus Walks"".


* **New Slaves** - Kanye is now at the point of feeling industry pressure, now realizing that labels and corporations behind the industry have him essentially by the balls. *Y'all throwing contracts at me | You know that niggas can't read | Throw 'em some Maybach keys | Fuck it, c'est la vie | I know that we the new slaves* These lines show the darker side of the industry that Kanye had realized after his first ego trip. The side the forces artists to put out mandatory albums and portray themselves in a stereotypical manner.

* **Hold my Liquor** - Ye has now fallen into the trap of fame and stereotypical black artist behavior at this point in his career, using liquor and drugs as an escape. This is Kanye's fall into his dark years. 
*Bitch I'm back out my coma | Waking up on your sofa | When I park my Range Rover | Slightly scratch your Corolla | Okay, I smashed your Corolla | I'm hanging on a hangover | Five years we been over* This show that Ye has fully embraced the lifestyle that he had been previously disgusted with and it has taken his toll on his relationships, specifically with his first ex-fiance.

* **I'm in it** - Falling even further Ye is now describing his hedonism when it came to women furthering himself into the very stereotype he had originally vowed against in ""New Slaves"". The following lyrics just show how Ye paints a raw picture of his former debauchery. *Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass | Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass | Your pussy's too good, I need to crash | Your titties, let 'em out, free at last | Thank God almighty, they free at last*.

* **Blood on the Leaves** - This brings the album nearly full circle back to Kanye's ""New Slaves"" revelation that he didn't want to be another stereotype, which sadly he did. He now realizes he has become what he vowed not to become as seen here *I just need to clear my mind now | It's been racin' since the summertime |And I'm holdin' down the summer now | And all I want is what I can't buy now* Ye is basically becoming self-aware and giving his stereotypical notions a big ""fuck you"" realizing that all he wants to be in happy, but he feels it's too late because he can't buy happiness. Kanye also alludes that he is constantly failing at relationships which he thinks will make him happy dues to his fame, with the lines *We could've been somebody 'stead you had to tell somebody*.

* **Guilt Trip** - Is set around the time Kanye was dating Amber Rose, but realizing the vibe was wrong he knew he had to let her go. This is shown by the lines *I need to call it off | I need to, I need to make it known | 'nother one, something gone | Capricorn | Dancing out on the lawn | Fancy like the things she likes | She lives her life | I'm living mine*.  It is also shown that Kanye regrets this as shown by Kid Cudi's hook *If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?*.

* **Send It Up** - Kanye, now more mature as an artist following his revelations with ""Blood on the Leaves"" and his loss in ""Guilt Trip"" realizes that he doesn't need to be as stereotypical as other black artists and begins to show restraint as shown with the lines *She say ""Can you get my friends in the club?"" | I say ""Can you get my Benz in the club?"" | If not, treat your friends like my Benz | Park they ass outside 'til the evening end*. This shows Kanye has grown up in  his own right, not letting groupies take advantage of him anymore or run his night.

* **Bound 2** - Finally the album's last song ""Bound 2"" fast forwards to the Kanye we have now. The man who has realized the dangers of falling into a stereotype and insane hedonism. A man who has realized that he can't buy happiness. Kanye has finally found a his missing piece with Kim, although he knows its not perfect, he's atleast working on it now that hes more mature as shown with these lines *And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep | But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect | And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving | So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas | She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist | Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches? | Maybe we could still make it to the church steps*.

Defended him to everyone I know who said his music was shit and listened to his music all the time. Naturally, when I found out he was coming to town, me and 3 of my friends decided to go his concert. Doors opened at 8, and it was supposed to end by 12, which was fine since we all had work the next day, a Monday. 

A couple of opening acts come on, and they're all right, nothing to write home about, and they finish by 10:30, at which point the house DJ is playing music. Then the MC announces Keef and the crowd goes nuts, but he doesn't show up. Then, every 30 minutes for the next couple of hours, one of his people comes up and says something to the MC, after which the MC hypes everyone up for Keef, only for him not to show. No word of what was happening or anything, just a guy getting us to chant his name, followed by nothing.

It got to be 1:00, an hour after the concert was supposed to be over and 3 hours after we expected him to come on. It was literally 2 hours of a DJ playing random music, everything from Gucci to Justin Timberlake. The MC even brought up audience members to rap verses. The opening guys came out again, but were booed so they left after a song or two. Since the guy who was driving us had work the next day and lived an hour away from the venue, we left at 1:15, tired and bored as hell from standing there. People near me in the crowd (I was right at the front, and had been there since the beginning) claimed that someone tweeted that he was too fucked up to perform and also that he passed out.

A girl I was texting told me he eventually came on at 1:30 and played a short set of some of his songs. I was pretty pissed that I blew 30 bucks and got a shitty rap concert and radio hits instead of what I expected. Needless to say, he's lost a fan because of this, I thought it was just shitty to do to his fans, the reason he's even there. I mean, I didn't expect much from Keef, but the least I expected was a concert.

Sorry if this is whiny or anything, I just thought that the fact he never gave any reason as to why he wasn't coming. Just thought I should share my story here.

I think the HHH fam will have some special appreciation for it.,IAmMosh,1496,318,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1i82ii/unexpected_i_just_had_the_most_fun_of_my_life/,"I am riding this high hard. I'm just so fucking AMPED that this just went down. Alright so check this out.

I worked as a wedding DJ for a few years and made some connections in the local music scene. A friend of mine was throwing together a little youth festival this weekend, and he had asked me to perform last night. I write electronic music (here if you're interested:http://iammosh.bandcamp.com/) under the name Mosh (relevant later) and I was pretty excited about it. It's pretty... angry music so I didn't really know how it was going to go down. Despite the music I write, I listen to hip-hop like no tomorrow.

Anyways, I show up and it's pretty obvious that this is a charity event. Lots of people who are clearly from impoverished neighbourhoods. I know that sounds sort of bad but. I'm sure you can imagine what I mean. And everyone is SUPER nice. Like, crazy welcoming and just warm people. The actual turn out for the event was pretty small, but we are downtown in this little park with a full stage and a BALLER sound set up (dual subs. It was crisp as hell and delicious from a technical perspective).

The guy before me is this dude named Realistik. Small dude, but jesus, he is freestyling like mad. Like straight up rapping about people walking by on the street. I've seen a lot of pro freestyles, and I can say with confidence that this guy blew them all out of the water. At one point he even referenced the event coordinator. I was damn impressed.

I had an idea. I write a ton of instrumental music, and most of it is dancey, but there is room for lyrics. I had ONE hip-hop beat I had been working on a few weeks ago. It was just a kick-sub-snare pattern so super bare and ""workable"" I slowed it down before I went on, and then I approached Realistik.

""How comfortable are you freestyling over a beat you don't know?""

""I can freestyle over anything"". Boss. This is fucking happening.

So I do my set, mostly dancey shit. I mix in some Yeezy acapellas and then an acapella of Lip Gloss (lol). Then I slow the beat the fuuck down, and call Realistik to the stage. I had him a mic, and just say, ""you ready?"" He nods. And we begin.


It's fucking fire. At one point he said some shit like ""Shouts out to Mosh from the fucking mosh pit, spinning fresh beats yeah that's the shit"". It was unbelievable. And then some seriously wicked shit went down.

He comes to me and asks if I can just keep it going. Fuck. Hell yes! SO about 6 of his buddies come to the stage and they get straight on that cypher shit. I was hyper-conscious of the beat getting repetitive so I started getting creative. I took the glassy piano from Monarchy (see above) and mixed it over the beat. Then this cut up of the lil mama acapella I had. I mixed a few of my other leads and hooks but they wouldn't stop! I mean they were passing the mic around for like 7 straight minutes at this point. SO I got a little cocky.

I started making beats on the fly. I mixed in the obvious ones first over this simple beat I had going. The intro to The Don (Nas), Mercy, Backseat Freestyle. Those sort of vocal sample. But then I wanted to be a little more creative.

I mixed in the intro guitar to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XZLlZ9vbfI) and the crowd went nuts. if I was on point, the rappers were fucking the point. Like, they were throwing down unbelievable rhymes. ""I jump from the stage over to the park bench (and he does this), girl in the sundress yeah that's my wench"". Like, it was playful, the flow was beautiful, the crowd was loving the interaction. Unreal. Then the grand finale.

There is this beautiful girl. Like, you know the kind with a slight curve in her back, and a slight pout with her lips that is just impossible to look away from? That kind of sexy.

She gets up on stage with her boyfriend. Holy fuck yes. She looks at me and gives me a thumbs up. Hell yeah I can make this work.

So her boyfriend starts rapping. He's got this chill sort of MF DOOM vibe but a little faster flow. I wish I could remember the rhymes cause he was just tearing it up. At this point I had already (with one hand, as my other was busy triggering the beat changes) imported a song I had an idea for.

SO he finished up his 16 or so bars, and hands the mic to this stunner of a girl. I have my beat ready. As soon as she starts spitting i drop in the piano part from [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kBm6c3veSA) and she compliments it soo well. It's the beat with the very end of the 8 bars saying ""you said you'd be-"" before it cuts. It was ICY. She has this airy really beautiful voice that kills me and the rest of the audience. She hands back to her boyfriend and I switch the beat to something more gritty.

This went on for like, probably five more minutes of freestyling rhymes and me dicking around on the beat, and it was insane. We essentially crafted a track on the fly, and it was ridiculously fun.

I went and thanked all the kids later. I was so unbelievably happy after I just went around and thanked all these wonderful people for giving me the time of my life. I may even collaborate with them in the future :) It was soooo rewarding seeing everyone just being on their a-game. We all just knew how to work with each other and having that kind of synchronicity with strangers just really gave me faith in humankind.

You gotta do most of the work, but Channel Orange will up your pimp game 200%.  Real pimps and heartbreakers only.  Bitch niggas need not apply.  Sperdoj can skip this one on principle. OP is not responsible for any pregnancies, broken dicks or ended relationships.*

Okay, so as most of you know, the baby makin album of 2012 came out a couple of days ago.  This upcoming weekend is the first Channel Orange weekend of the summer.  A lot of yall are gonna try and pull some Channel Orange shit on ya girl this weekend, and this guide is being made to help yall pull this off flawlessly.   Unless you were at fuckin age when D'Angelo's ""Voodoo"" came out, this is some of yall's first real love making album experience.  This album is a refreshing break from all the derogatory SPIT ON MY DICK BITCH albums that we've been fucking to recently. This is not a concrete guide; this is merely a good starting place.  At the end of the day, trust your instincts.

To put it plainly, this is a making love album.  This ain’t a fucking album.  If you tryin to slap hams hardcore and be on some nigga shit, pop Futuresex-Lovesounds back in.  This one is for the smooth niggas.

Frank Ocean constructed this album for the players.  I’m gonna take you through the album and let you know where you should be by the time each track comes on.

1.  Okay, so you got homegirl over at the crib.  Yall just came back from a fancy ass steak dinner at Denny’s which you had to take a shit after but you don’t wanna shit in your bathroom because you know she’s eventually gonna go in there and you don’t wanna lay down work in there so you use your roommate bathroom.  Candles lit, pop open a bottle of Andre, and turn on that motha fuckin Ocean.
2.  When “Thinkin about you” comes on, she’s gonna know what’s up.  No words are necessary for this one.  Let Frank spit the game for you.  Follow his instructions.  Make your move when he hit that first high note.  Be like, ""You wanna know what I'm thinkin bout?"" and she gonna be like ""What"" and then just go in there don't even answer the bitch with words son that's gonna get that bitch wet as the Great Lakes.
3.  Get into the makin out/undressing phase.  Someone should be getting domed up by “Sweet Life.”  This is imperative to the timing of this album.  When you hear Sweet Life, make sure someone’s lips are on some gentials.  Either her or you.  Don’t matter.  For all you new niggas, you might have to eat some pussy first in order to get this thing rollin.  For all my experienced niggas who could get some dome from the Queen of England in the wintertime just because they game that tight, you already know how to proceed.
4.  Don’t be that nigga that makes your girl dome you up for like 45 minutes and her jaw hurtin n shit.  Unless she got that super dome, you probably not gonna nut off this dome.  Just let it be, it's okay.  This is sensual night, not real nigga night.  Switch it up by Super Rich Kids.  Be nice.
5.  PYRAMIDS.  This is when you get to the pipe laying.  Don’t try and do everything at once.  This album gives you plenty of time to lay down work.  Pyramids has a good stroke rhythm to it.  Go with it.  She gonna be moanin and yellin and goin on but don’t say shit.  Let Frank speak for you.  You can’t out sexy Frank at this point.
6.  Someone should nut at Bad Religion.  It’s just the perfect nut song.  It’s probably gonna be you, but if you a real pipe layer, make it her.  If she hasn’t gotten hers by now she just a stone cold bitch or your stroke ain’t right.  If she ain’t half dead by Bad Religion you need to fix your game.
7.  Everything post-Bad Religion is for all you 2 nut niggas (young niggas).  I ain’t impressin nobody.  I’m getting mine and laying down.  For all the old niggas, everything post Bad Religion is cuddle shit.  Listen to Forrest Gump and be like “awww Frank just want some bootyhole but he cant aww” and say something about how supportive you are of Frank and the LGBT movement and yo girl gonna think you all sensitive n shit (unless you got a Republican joint.  Then just skip that one.  But hell if you got a Republican joint she probably wasn’t feeling Frank from the start and probably wanted to fuck to some Kenny Chesney or some shit anyway, so that’s your L to take homeboy.)

I remember being only 11 years old in a Circuit City with my mom, BEGGING her to let me buy my first album since I had my own money. She eventually gave in, allowing me only to buy the clean version. The only thing I remember after that is driving her crazy by playing it NON-STOP. 

Of course, at 11 years old, I couldn't quite understand everything that Kanye was talking about. But now, as I look back and re-listen to the album as a young, black, college student myself, I understand it all. I get the concept behind the album, the skits, the themes, etc. and it all hits home. I can really relate to this album and Kanye, especially being an audio production major. And I know I would not be as interested in hip hop/rap or beat production and sampling, if it weren't for this album. 

Also, this might be a biased opinion, but being born in the 90's, I definitely think that this is one of the Top 3 best albums of my generation, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. 

TL;DR: The College Dropout is my favorite album because it gave me a view of the world as a young black man when I was only a young boy and now it's all making sense.

[My favorite song from the album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNVbFQHf9L8)

Edit: Thanks for sharing, everyone. I only made this post because I was extra excited when I found out that it was the album's birthday and I wanted to share a little story. I didn't think this post would take off like it did, but I'm glad to hear that others feel the same way I do about this album.

Hey, were almost at 100K subscribers. Thank Mac Miller for that last bit next time you see him. 

XXL hangs around, J Cole bought us ads and Kitty Pryde is probably reading this right now. Next step, rap money.

[We’ve Gotten some Great AMA’s from the reddit admins themselves - Mr. Jermaine.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1gved1/hi_im_j_cole_ama/)

We’ve also been getting a string of AMAs from /u/boltcutter , [including one from Large Professor]( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1hikly/ama_i_am_large_professor_aka_large_pro_aka_extra/).

[We even put out our own Mixtape]( http://www.datpiff.com/HipHopHeads-ObieOne-Presents-Circlejerk-The-Mixtape.495939.html), headed by /u/ObieOne , with another on the way.

We’re not the little corner of the internet used to be anymore. While some users miss the smaller community, there’s no denying that we’re getting a lot more opportunities now that we have the size and some pull around these parts. That being said, [with great power comes great responsibility]( http://howtocleancar.info/wp-content/uploads/cartoons/cartoon_pictures_of_spidermanddda1effed2e0399b90abeb0cbb16_240x375.jpg-1a27ca83e7e4ffb70ede4d0b68ab2246.gif) and with 100K people, we need some new rules in order to keep things focused.

•	**New Essentials Format**: We’re going to be splitting up the current essentials list into two separate lists: Classic Essentials (2000 and Earlier) and Modern Essentials (2001 and Forward). We think this will give us a better range of essentials that cover both the amazing albums that blew out your mom’s minivan speakers and you were grounded for a week plus the albums that just set a new bar for what rap music can and would sound like. We **may** keep the records we already have plus adding some new ones so look out for the thread. We haven't ironed out the details yet. We may restart the whole thing.

•	**New Daily Discussion Threads**: Modeled after our Sunday posts, we’re going to start creating a daily discussion thread so people can speak on what albums they’ve been listening to or just shoot the shit. With 100K people, our main goal is to reduce clutter so if you have some thoughts on an album, a quick discovery (Large Professor started using sleigh bells instead of cymbals?), or something to say, we’d encourage you to use this thread. Others will be in there looking to talk also. We will be making the first one **on July 18th**.

•	**Moronic Mondays are now OFFICIAL**: Ever have a quick question about something but nowhere to ask? Every Monday, /u/Pompsy will create the Moronic Monday thread, where you can ask whatever questions you’d like and the users will answer them. In order to try and reduce clutter, please save your questions for Mondays. **All one-off question discussion posts will be deleted.** For instance, any thread like ""Why Dont SpaceghostPurrp &amp; Rocky Like Each Other?"" or ""What Does Gunplay Smell Like?"" will be deleted. Please post your questions in either the discussion threads or wait for Mondays for the Moronic Monday thread.

•	**Hype Week Starts Sunday**: Since we’re at 100K, let’s do something fun. Next Week is Hype Week. Since a lot of up and coming rappers tend to get burried, we're making next week devoted to up and coming rappers, producers and the like. Use the [HYPE] tag on text posts to get the color to change. *Please only post new artists and [FRESH] songs and news. Other songs may be deleted, even a Max B track on Wednesday*.

•	**ALL SONGS MUST HAVE AT LEAST AN ARTIST AND SONG NAME IN THE POST TITLE** : This should improve the search function in addition to being a simple thing we can do in order to clean up the posts and make this place look a little better. 

•	**Official Album Discussion Threads Will Now Come From Us**: For major releases (TBD by the Mods) we will be making an Official Discussion Thread for the album, every day for a week. These threads should contain all news and opinions on that album for the day. *All posts concerning an album which has a discussion thread going will be removed*. For releases which everyone isn’t busting nuts, we will make one the day of. If you see that an album has come out and the mods haven’t made a thread, please message us. There’s a lot of rap music.

•	**The only allowable twitter posts are official announcements or back and forths broken down in a self-post only.**

•	Please try to keep parent comments on topic and meaningful. We know we're out here.

* We're also adding to the mod team to help with the work, so everyone treat /u/TunaFied and /u/RiceBurger like decent human beings now.

• 	Look out for /u/TheHHHRobot for more official announcements beepboopbeep

So that's where we stand. we think these are some simple rules to introduce that wont harm or inhibit discussions while also cleaning this place up and keeping in mind that there are 100,000+ of us. So, now that we've told you to clean up your room for the past 10 minutes, what do YOU think? Let us know what you think about the sub, what you think can improve and what you'd like to see more of. We'll be reading this over and digging through for good ideas

Stay Based,

1100 responses so far and there are some pretty close categories right now, so do your democratic duty and shit!

------

As I said, click ""None of the above"" if you don't see who you like or don't want to vote on a category.

I took out the ""best banger"" category because the repetition between some of the categories was just too much. I was hoping for a lot more diversity in the responses, but it is what it is...

**Edit:** We're at 1100 responses. This is why there needs to be closed questions. Organizing thousands of open ended responses is just not fun. 

I'm sorry that there is a limited selection in the categories. I thought having too much choice could be overwhelming and lead to people quitting the survey ~~and I also thought ""what's the point"" considering that we can all guess who is going to be in the top 3 in each category.~~ The nomination process was completely open and I clearly stated the number of nominees that would be included in each category. I added additional nominees on top of the number I said I would to allow for more choice. Open-ended questions would be great, but I needed to strike a balance between choice and efficiency. 

I crossed out that line because I wasn't explaining myself clearly. I meant to say that I think the nominees that are included would have been in the top few anyways, not that your vote/nominations don't matter.

I know it's not ideal, but you know, way she goes.

*Clarification*: I didn't choose these nominees. Nominations were open to everyone for almost two weeks in r/HHHawards.

Apparently some users took this opportunity to downvote anyone who had anything negative to say about lil wayne, troll through their post history and post their personal information, etc. etc.  It got so bad that the /r/music thread got removed.

**THIS IS SEVERELY AGAINST THE RULES**.  We even had to have a reddit admin come into our sub and try and get you guys to stop (and some of yall had the audacity to give a reddit admin lip.  Dont you know they can end yo whole life?)

This is seriously not a good look.  Look, we're 100k deep now.  You guys have actual pull out here.  You need to be on your best behavior, especially on other subs.  This is not SRS.  If we see you organizing downvote brigades, we will remove your posts, and if you continue, we will ban your ass.  This is not a subreddit rule; this is a reddit wide rule.  When you see the red [A] next to someone's name, that's when you know you're in trouble.

Read the [reddiquette guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) in addition to HHH guidelines when posting.  Both are in effect.

Let's please not stoop to the level of other subreddits again.  I know you guys are better than that.  We've built a reputation as one of the better subs on this website; lets not squander it because you wanna get into fights with neckbeards.  Do it on your own time; do not organize hate parades on this sub.

After talking with the mods, they have allowed me to make a single thread regarding all Kanye West album news so that /r/hhh won't be filled with Yeezus.

So here's how this goes: 

1. All of the comments for the main thread will be news related only. 

1. All rumors and non-related news I ask should be downvoted so we see current, up to date information at the top. 

1. All news must be backed up with a reliable source (No Celebrity Gossip Type* shit please)

1. Please upvote the more recent reports to the top to keep things updated

1. All discussion regarding each news should be discussed on the comment trees of each main comment

1. And praise be the glory to Yeezus

Hope you're having a jolly good day.  

A lot has changed since we put our first essentials list together.  Seems like only yesterday, you guys grow up so fast!

Well seeing as how we're, ""Really out here"" now (is that how the kids say it?) We decided that we needed to take another look at how our essentials list is set up.  Currently, we just have one big list.  This was cool at first, but hip-hop is a history riddled diverse genre with a lot of different albums that contributed to the game and trying to boil it all down to one list proved difficult.  

So, what we've decided to do is to break up the essentials list into two parts:  The first part, which we will be voting on today, is for ""current"" essentials.  This includes any albums made from 2001 to the present.  The next stage, which will be made in a different thread, will be for ""classic"" essentials, which will be all albums from 2000 back.  

Albums to consider for ""current"" essentials would be albums that you deem necessary for a present day understanding of the genre.  Classic voting would constitute albums that helped build the mantle that the current day essentials stand upon.  But let's take it one step at a time and focus on the current essentials:

**VOTING RULES**

ONE ALBUM PER COMMENT

COMMENTS WITH MULTIPLE ALBUMS WILL BE REMOVED

In order to nominate an album, you need to include the artist, the name of the album, and the year it was released.  If you miss any of these points, the vote will not count and the comment will be removed.  For example, a prototype vote looks like this:

**Artist - Album - Year**

Any off topic comments need to be kept in the replies.  Original comments need to be for votes only.

Ctrl+F is your friend.  If someone has already submitted the album you're about to submit, just upvote theirs.  Multiple votes for the same album will be removed.

The highest upvoted comments will be added to the new essentials list.  Good luck and happy voting!

Source: http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/50-things-you-didnt-know-about-kanye-west/

**Childhood**

 Kanye lived in China for a year in 5th grade, he would get the kids to trade him sheep skewers for brakedance performances. He made his first beat in 7th grade, the beat was for a sexual Mario-style video game that he programmed, where ""the ghosts were vaginas.""When he was 13, he cried when his dad didn't let him get his hair cut often enough to keep up a high top fade.

**Pre College Dropout**

After dropping out of school, he worked as a telemarketer to pay his mom the $200 a month in rent she demanded.He sold his first beat to local Chicago rapper Gravity for $8,800 and used the money to buy a Jesus Piece and Polo clothes, a year later, he sold the chain to No I.D. to help finance his move to NYC. No I.D. briefly fell back from helping Kanye when he took him to label meetings and 'Ye jumped on tables shouting that he was the next Michael Jackson, he'd ""leave meetings crying all the time"" before he got signed.

**College Dropout**

He shot the video for ""Through The Wire"" with $35,000 of his own money. When the Hezekiah Walker Chorus didn't deliver, he drove to the Hamptons and paid the Harlem Boys Choir $10,000 to get on ""Two Words."" He thought The College Dropout ""fell short of the actual Fiona Apple or Portishead sound"" he was going after.

**Late Registration**

Rick Rubin, who Kanye's called the ""Hollywood Yellow Pages,"" hooked him up with Late Registration co-producer, Jon Brion. The picture in the slideshow has him alongside [A-Trak](http://cdnl.complex.com/mp/620/400/80/0/bb/1/ffffff/b2e5adb8f265726e822a18c385323987/images_/assets/CHANNEL_IMAGES/MUSIC/2013/02/50-things-you-didnt-know-about-kanye-west/brion_495255.jpg) in 2005 who now owns Fools Gold Records.He originally planned a theatrical release for all of the music videos from Late Registration. While working on Late Registration, he kept a side-by-side tracklisting of Common's Be in the studio to make sure his own album was just as good.M.I.A. was supposed to be on album cut ""Drive Slow.""

**Graduation**

Timbaland helped with the drums on ""Stronger."" A lesser known fact is movie director Michael Gondry helped with the drums on ""Diamonds."". Graduation's ""stadium"" sound was inspired by touring with the Rolling Stones and U2.""Stronger"" took 50 mixes and eight engineers to complete.Micheal Jackson called him to ask about the jacket he wore in the ""Stronger"" video.He wrote a personal letter about his dad to Donald Fagen of Steely Dan to get the ""Kid Charlemagne"" sample cleared for ""Champion.""

**808s &amp; Heartbreaks**

While recording 808s &amp; Heartbreak, he saw Hawaii's 808 area code as a sign that the album was meant to be.He booked a flight to Minnesota to work with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver but it was canceled because of snowstorm. He invited Vernon to work on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in Hawaii instead.


**My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy**

Kanye made Pusha T re-write his ""Runaway"" verse four times and pushed him to be more of a douchebag each time.While getting his hair cut, he rapped ""Power"" to Pete Rock before he even laid vocals.Q-Tip said Kanye would even ask people who delivered food for their opinion on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.Nicki Minaj's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy intro is based on writer Roald Dahl's ""Cinderella.


**Random Kanye Facts**

He doesn't keep his Grammys or any other awards in his house. He said: ""I TiVo rap videos so I can study them. To learn what steps to take to crush them all.""He says that Drake was the first artist who actually scared and put pressure on him. Some of his unreleased music includes a record with Jay-Z and Jack White and a song that samples music from Broadway musical Wicked.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1361931550.0,,kingcobra,True,t3_19ancn,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/19ancn/complex_made_a_list_of_50_lessknown_kanye_and_i/,

When thunder thighs are rumbling to a bombastic beat, our demands for wordplay are as low as a Lambo (thank you Gucci Mane). When some rappers recognize our indifference, they stop materializing and degrading with the passion they once had, and it shows in their work. Nothing captures this laziness more than claiming to be being “hotter” than something.

The concept of being hot in rap music doesn’t even reach the shallowness of physical appearance. Being hot is a vague combination of being popular, talented, or possessing a minimum amount of swag. Saying you’re hot provides no additional insight into your character, your financial worth, or your ability to peddle narcotics.

Despite it’s inherent meaninglessness, the analogy remains a favorite among superstars. In 25 different songs, Lil’ Wayne claims to possess more heat than X. While Trina wins most thoughtless with her “hotter than a heater” line. My favorite, “hotter than Papa Bear’s porridge,” makes me wonder if mama bear possesses no street credibility based on her heat index. While this cliché is among the most cringeworthy, joining alcohol name dropping and staying true to the streets, don’t expect it to die any time soon. Here is a list of popular examples to shake your head at.

EDIT 2: 

**Clarification on questions**

- Apologies about not being able to pick multiple races or if we missed the race you identify with. Most of my comments about that question found below are jokes.

- ""So what's the difference between ""better than ever"" and ""as good as it's ever been"""" for the state of hip-hop question? The former means you think hip-hop is better than ever, the latter means you think it is just as good as it's always been - stable. There's a distinction between the two. 

- The rap vs. hip hop question is with regards to music. We aren't talking about ""oh, rap is a part of hip hop *culture*""...we're asking if you see rap and hip hop music as two discrete entities. 

Rather than asking open-ended questions or a lot more questions in general, murdah opted for a streamlined questionnaire with a bit of humor in it. I think he made a good choice in that regard.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1353047274.0,,rex,True,t3_137icm,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/137icm/rhiphopheads_census_open_until_7pm_on_thursday/,moderator

1367521605.0,645,self.hiphopheads,1dkh5i,My time with Curren$y,KimBongIl,743,98,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1dkh5i/my_time_with_curreny/,"So last night I went to Jet Lounge at HoB NOLA. For the uninformed, Jew Lounge is a little get-together that Curren$y hosts every wednesday at House of Blues. The lounge is essentially a smoker's club where locals come to smoke and chill and listen to a dj spin some dope tunes. I went for the third time last night and, lo and behold, Curren$y decided to show up to. I was unaware of this until someone mentioned his presence to me while I was chillin on the couch sippin a brew. Naturally I get a little excited; *I could potentially hang with spitta himself*. If that were to happen, I would be extremely elated, as my friends and I all religiously subscribe to spitta fandom. I was also barred out as fuck so I was kinda aimlessly walking around. Eventually I find myself standing near the VIP section. Then, unprovoked, Spitta approaches me and asks if I can bum him some papers. I told him I didn't have any but I have a joint. He said ""nah man its all good, I'll smoke you out, I just need some papers"" I said ""fuck I usually carry some but I don't have em on me. lets spark this joint I have."" So I spark the joint, pass it to spitta, he takes a few hits, gives me the nod of approval, gives me some dap, and says ""good shit homie"", and we smoke until the joint is burned. Keep in mind that I had dropped two bars and was basically retarded at that point, so I was sort of oblivious to what had just happened. I *needed* confirmation that I'd just smoked with spitta. So I pat him on the back, he turns around, and I said ""Yo bro I am barred out as fuck, I just need to make sure you're actually Curren$y and that actually just happened."" He laughed, said hell yeah, and I gave him a high five and we laughed some more. Then we parted ways. I took a couple things from the experience:

* Spitta is as cool as you think he is
* Spitta will smoke you out if you have papers
* Bring papers with you always
* Don't drop bars at Jet Lounge because you'll appear to have cerebral palsy in front of the man himself

In closing, I must reiterate that spitta is a homie. He raps about weed, cars, women, and staying true to his roots. Last night he confirmed that he practices what he preaches: he pulled up in the Arnage, offered to smoke me out, and kept it real with his brethren. My love for spitta has transcended an appreciation for just his music. I love him as a personality. He's a rapper of integrity and, in a culture where false and hollow aesthetics are celebrated, his realness is refreshing.

TL;DR: Spitta is as cool as you think he is

Things I learned:

1. **Promoters treat local artists like shit** - Like seriously.  It was annoying. They don't respect you at all, and they really won't make any concessions for you so that you can put on a good show.  They wouldn't even let my DJ use his own setup, we had to plug into the house system and my DJ had to use someone else's computer/mixer because they didn't wanna unplug anything (which is a 3 minute process btw). They herd you in and out like cattle.  But then I realized that one of the reasons its like this is because:

2. **Most local rappers suck ass** - I don't know if its just my city or what but jesus christ.  And its not even me being cocky or anything like that, they were objectively not good. One dude got booed off the stage for lip syncing ""Ride with me"" by Nelly.  Can't make this shit up folks.

3. **If the show is all ages, its probably not a good idea to invite a bunch of girls onstage to twerk with you** - If you have to ask ""who's 18"" and only like 1/3rd of hands go up and you have to kick girls off stage for looking too young, you should probably just avoid doing that.  Ferg and Juice invited girls on stage and I felt like I was watching kiddie porn.  Which leads me into my next, most important topic:

4. **White girls, please stop twerking** - Please. Like *please*.  You're just embarrassing yourself and everyone who knows you.  Stick to the ""jingle bell rock"" dance number from Mean Girls or something but do not twerk in public ever again.  If ""smh"" had a face, it was the face of everyone in the crowd watching 15 year old girls shake their ""butts"" out of sync with the music until security kicked them off stage.

Even with all of that though, the show was still really good.  Ferg went pretty hard for being a second fiddle, and Juice brought it hard as usual.  It was a very exhilarating experience being in front of that many people, and having random people fuck with your shit. To control a crowd like that, to have them eating out of the palm of your hand...that kind of power can drive a man mad.  I now understand.  

But I would just once again like to thank all of you for helping me get here.  I would've never had that opportunity to do that without you guys.  I didn't rap before I started posting here and you guys taught me a lot about how to do it well and what the people want.  They really let us in the rap game.

Hov gonna be hittin us for features any day now. just wait, just wait.

We have an [essential mixtape](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1bfctw/the_first_essential_mixtape_list/) list, HHDX knows who we are an our mod team is incredibly handsome. Let's keep it goin so that semi famous rappers change their twitter pictures to shit we post aka fame. but lets take a second to rehash the rules

###No Pictures

* /r/hiphopimages for that. It's still getting off it's feet so make sure to subscribe and add to it.

###No Posting Off Of The Essentials List

* We love the albums but have all talked about how good Deck's verse is on Triumph. Let it be

###Use The Search Bar Before You Post

* Let's keep this place uncluttered and moving forward.  Yes, we've heard Uncommon Valor.  Yes, we know you don't quite get Lil B or RiFF RAFF.  Yes, you may want a soundtrack to fuck something to.  All that and more is available...[RIGHT HERE, AT R/HIPHOPHEADS!](http://www.pitch.com/imager/comedy-one-giant-leap-for-mankind/b/original/3112195/d282/Mick_Foley_Studio.jpg)

###Don't Forget About the [""NEW""](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/new/) Tab

* There's new music there. let's make sure we're checking out new things to keep the front page from getting stale

###Please don't post ""[some shit] may happen (from twitter/fb)"" 

* we're not here for rumors, we're not TMZ; check twitter for artist uncertainties and bullshittin. We only want certainties and official biz to look forward to.

###THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING ATMOSPHERE

* there's been a lot of, for lack of any better term at all, ""Unprovoked Backpack hate"" recently. Shit needs to calm down. Comin down on someone just for liking El-P is just as bad as people coming down on you for liking Cam'Ron just because he raps about drugs &amp; guns (very well might i add). Lets try to make this a place where all hip hop can live in peace like some sort of Rap Kibbutz. Let's keep in mind that there's a difference between ""I'm not too into Rapper X"" and ""Rapper X's music is the primary cause for all types of cancer currently present on this planet"". In short, don't be a dick about rap music. Try not to throw the B-Word around all willy nilly to spark the Jansport Revolution.

So that's what I see. What do y'all like? What don't you like? What do you want to see more? Talk amongst yourselves.

Yours in Beats,

Let's assume Nas died sometime around 94-95. Do you think people would put him above Big and Pac? Would Illmatic have gone diamond if he died after its release? Who can tell..

I'll start things off:

Jay-Z = Jordan. In terms of individual and team success, as well as influence on pop culture, MJ has to be Hov.

Kanye = LeBron. Seemingly the only active rapper who can knock Hov off his pedestal; he just keeps improving his game.

Nas = Grant Hill. Started off hot as fuck (Grant Hill lead the all-star voting in his rookie season - Illmatic) dropping triple doubles for fun. Dropped off from his best for some time and never reached those heights again, but still produces some solid results.

2Pac/Biggie = Magic/Bird. The quintessential west v east rivals, the two biggest figures in their time.

Big L = Penny Hardaway. So much promise, but tragically cut short.

N.W.A = Portland ""Jail-Blazers"". 'nuff said.

Wu-Tang = Detroit Pistons circa 2004.

Lil' Wayne = Allen Iverson. Produced some amazing stuff but then went to shit partly in thanks to his craziness.

DMX = Stephen Jackson. Dey 'aint 'bout dis life.

OutKast = Kobe+Shaq. Here you have one of the most technically gifted in the game (Andre 3k, Kobe) alongside his big *partner, with success to follow.

Kendrick = James Harden. Relatively new to the game but put out some good shit. In 2012 he blew the fuck up.

A$AP Rocky = Kyrie Irving. New to the game but literally everyone is on his dick.

The boy gave an interview to [tilllate.com](http://ch.tilllate.com/de/story/kendrick-konzert-aufgemischt?ref=20min-story) heres the interesting part translated:

&gt;""After the last song started Kendrick said 'get me that boy on stage!' I knew right away that he meant me. He gave me his hand and I was standing on stage. That was an feeling beyond descriptions"" says the 17y old Mattia to tilllate.com, ""already during the concert Kendrick noticed how I was the only one knowing the lyrics of his old tracks"" [...]
Afterwards Kendrick and Mattia left the stage towards the back. What backstage happened knew nobody in the sold out arena. ""We sat down and talked. The bully bodyguard wanted me to take a picture and leave right away but Kendrick was very kind. He gave me something - but i don't want to tell what it is."" Kendrick's said that he'd like to come back to Switzerland. Mattias answer to that: ""I'll always stand in the front-row""

tl;dr: kendrick takes boy on stage for last song, takes him backstage, gives him something; boy wont tell what, and says he'll always stand in front row for future kendrick lamar concerts.

I know people are posting guides now and I wanted to do one for a rapper that wasn't basically a legend everyone was already familiar with. A lot of people know about Danny but really haven't been introduced into his full discography, which is surprisingly extensive.

Danny Brown has been building quite the buzz, and seems to be quite the polarizing figure in the rap game, so with the upcoming August release of Old, many people should get to know him. This is how I feel you should go about getting into Danny Brown and listening to his music. I am *not* going in chronological order in his discography.

If you want some quick but good Danny Brown shit then skip down to part two.

If you want I can probably give people downloads to things they can't find that I mention in here.

*****PART ONE: THE MASTERMIND*****

**Background**

You'll learn a lot about Danny's life through his music, but you should have a basic run-down before jumping into his music. Danny is a dirty Detroit nigga, born and raised. He lost his front tooth in a KFC parking lot. He is known for his obnoxious and over-the-top music and his versatile flow. His dad was a DJ and tried to keep him sheltered for as long as he could but Danny eventually starting hustling. He is now a part of the crew Bruiser Brigade. You can probably learn more on Wikipedia, so I digress...

**[XXX (2011)](http://www.datpiff.com/Danny-Brown-XXX-mixtape.298540.html)**

Listen to XXX multiple times. The first time, you will most likely not like it. I know I didn't, and that's because it is really hard to get used to his style. Listen to it and try to see past the dick jokes and drug references (but those are fucking hilarious and should not be ignored) and on the second or third time try to find some themes in the tape. The first half is almost satirical and the second gets incredibly deep and introspective, culminating in this fantastic finale, 30. I think the tape is about Danny's evolution as a person at the age of 30. The first track is XXX, which is 30 in roman numerals, but is juvenile in the sense that it also has implications of pornography. That's what the first half is - juvenile. By the end of the tape, he is 30, more mature, not XXX.

I would post some standout tracks but honestly the project is meant to be viewed as a whole before listening to individual songs. Don't forget to check out the bonus tracks from XXX in the iTunes version.

**[Black and Brown (2011)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm2HhzPlc6k)**

This is a short collaborative EP with Black Milk. This is Danny Going in over some smooth, some funky, and some really weird beats where he just rips the mic. It is a glimpse into Danny's older style and flow - one that is more focused solely on spitting and while it is less varied it is fucking fantastic.

*Standout tracks:*

 - [Black and Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfNe-g45T5U)
 - [Loosie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-B4ORYOSaM)
 - [Jordan VIII](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTjYCSlBt_4)

**[The Hybrid (2010)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oANZS7xxwXk)**

Danny's first studio album. It is a solid collection of tracks. It doesn't have an established direction or theme but will show you more of his styles and abilities. This is Danny flexing some of his verbal muscles and sort of a cross between what you heard on XXX and Black and Brown.

*Standout tracks:*

 - [Greatest Rapper Ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQxKE5ItAu0)
 - [The Nana Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlXOPdmYrnQ)

*****PART TWO: THE MUSICAL BUTTERFLY*****

**The Singles**

Now it's time to take a break from the full projects and listen to some tracks Danny has dropped along the way. Some of these are from Old and some have no project to call home. These are definitely not all his singles but some of his more popular and standout ones. I am counting appearances on producers' tracks as singles even if there are other rappers on it.

*****PART THREE: THE OLD ERA*****

Now you are ready to really dig into the pussy-eater's discography. This is some old shit. Many people think Danny's new album is called Old because he is considered old in the rap game but in an interview he actually revealed that it is an homage to his older music, to when people say ""where's that old Danny Brown?""

You have two options. If you liked the ridiculous tracks from XXX and The Hybrid more then go listen to Hot Soup, and if you enjoyed the old-school grimey flow of Black and Brown and a few songs from The Hybrid and XXX more then listen to Detroit State of Mind 4. After listening to one, listen to the other and then move on down the list.

**[Hot Soup (2008)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BcR2jeytJQ)**

It is fucking fire. This is what starting a lot of the slow buzz for Danny but it is really slept on now. It brings a funky sound but is accompanied by some great bangers.

*Standout tracks:*

 - [Work Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQrEW_KQgak)
 - [What Up Doe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDAc7GD2e8) - SMOKE GREEN LIKE I SHOT A NINJA TURTLE
 - [Dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGggAopmPwg)
 - [Head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yE6FeHvuVo)

**[Detroit State of Mind 4 (2010)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18IO58ipjOk)**

The most popular mixtape of his DSOM series, and probably the first one you should listen to. Characterized by a dark and vicious Danny hungry and ready for every beat thrown at him, this mixtape really shows that he can hold his own as far as straight spitting goes.

*Standout tracks:*

 - [Murder Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uELW9bx2u9I)
 - [Contra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0wpCqy0SdY)
 - [L.O.L.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcgMQXnytDY)
 - [On My Shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNAt8TNea0U)

**Runispokets-N-Dumpemindariva by Rese'vor Dogs (2003)**

Danny Brown was a part of a group named Rese'vor Dogs made up of Dopehead and Chips, both of whom are now Bruiser Brigade members. They put out a really solid project with a dirty Detroit feel. Birdman makes some appearances.

*Standout tracks:*

 - [Y'all Not](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI_0YRTWjgg)
 - [Who Runnin' 'Dis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqMdPtnH_0)
 - [Life's a Bitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INmKu2mqhZw)
 - [On The Block](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1fSsjQ3JVg)

**Detroit State of Mind 1, 2 and 3**

These all have the same feel of DSOM4 so I'm just going to post some highlights from each.

*Standout tracks from [Detroit State of Mind (2007)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c6q_Sm5-w4):*

*Standout tracks:*

 - Stay On

**Bruiser Brigade EP (2012)**

Basically a very short EP Danny did with BB. Not much to say. [Listen here.](http://www.datpiff.com/Danny-Brown-Dopehead-Bruiser-Brigade-EP-mixtape.397983.html)

**[It's A Art (2010)](http://mixtapemonkey.com/mixtape?m=581)**

Basically in line with the DSOM series. Not a ton to say, but it's worth a listen if you've made it this far.

*Standout tracks:*

 - It's A Art (316)
 - Friday Night
 - Low
 - Lemme Know

&gt;Simply put, this verse was not supposed to happen. This came about when Kanye fell asleep after Pusha T finished his verse. Cyhi was only supposed to do his short hook, but recorded a full 16 bars. As Cyhi states here:

*“I wasn’t supposed to be on ‘So Appalled’. People don’t know that. I kinda cheated. [Kanye] said, ‘Can you think of something to write on the hook?’ I peeped he was kinda sleepy at the time. So he went to sleep, went to the room or something. I stayed in the studio and I said I’m not gonna just do no hook. I’m gonna do my verse.”*

*I did a verse and didn’t tell him the verse was on there and I hid it. He was playing the album for some very important musicians and he played the song. He don’t know my verse is gonna come on and everybody in the room goes bananas. He said, ‘I gotta keep it.’”*",,False,,t5_2rh4c,False,,captmurph,True,t3_1ivts4,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1ivts4/i_think_cyhi_da_prynces_story_on_how_he_got_on_so/,

1372185522.0,525,self.hiphopheads,1h1y42,I thought now would be a good time to share this story about Wale,HalfBlackKid,663,138,297,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1h1y42/i_thought_now_would_be_a_good_time_to_share_this/,"If you haven't read it before it's fuckin' hilarious and a x-post from KTT. Happened a few months back.

One of the reasons I will never refer Wale to anyone again. 

http://i.imgur.com/acTG3lL.jpg

&gt; It was around January or February of 2012. I had started going to a ton of local gigs around Boston (where I'm from) to get involved in the culture. I had been going alone, no friends or anything. Now around October I had met this dude named ""Da Corporation."" He had worked with other Boston MCs like Young Bean and O.T.O. This dude was young and real cool, we became good homies. Now back to February. Corp had been contacted by Daniel Weisman (Wale's manager) or one of his representatives and asked to open for him at a show in New Haven. Corp asked if I wanted to join him. I really fucked with Wale's music so I said yeah. Why not. Free show. My dude is performing. 

&gt;Okay, flash to the show. We had been on a long ass road trip, we were hungry as hell. But we didn't have any time to grab anything. This one dude named David or Davion said the team (Wale and people) were going to go get food after and we could join them. I was like hell yeah. eatin dinner with Wale. That'll be sick.

&gt;Corp killed it. Got the crowd jumpin and everything. I was hyped. Wale came through later and I expected him to do something like say my friend did a good job or something but nah. He didn't say shit he came out and started performing. I was like whatever and started jamming.

&gt;After the show. We follow that Davion dude to Wale's bus and ask where we're going. Then some white dude says that they're going to get pizza and to hang tight and that Wale is in the back we can chill. So we go to the back, say hey. He says nothing. My friend sits down next to him, I sit down across from him. Wale is just texting. I didn't want to be an asshole so my friend and I just started talking about random shit like the trip or or comic books or how dope the show was (Wale couldn't hear us). Then my friend slides over and tries to dap Wale and talks about how much he loved Ambition and he was honored to perform. Now let me tell you this part is completely true. Wale looks up from his phone, stares my friend in the eye as he's speaking, then says ""shut the fuck up"" literally fifteen times in a row. My friend already shut up from the first one. Wale shakes his head like he's disgusted or something then looks back at his phone. My friend was in shock. He didn't expect that at all. He moved over to sit next to me instead so Wale was alone on the couch with a few girls and some dude we didn't know. We started talking again waiting for the food and Wale looks up and asks ""you two know what shut the fuck up mean?"" the girls start laughing and i make a ""wtf"" face. Wale shakes his head and laughs at me. Saying I look retarded. And that my friend was a wack performer.

&gt;Corp didn't want to start shit so he kept his head down and stayed quiet. I was pissed off. I asked Wale why he would invite Da Corporation if he didn't think he was good. Wale just shrugged and said he didn't even know about it. I was shaking my head and began whispering to Corp about how Wale was a bitch. I think Wale noticed me talking shit because he came over and started me in my eyes. Like he was gonna fuckin kill me. He told us to get the fuck out and Corp managed to say that we were waiting for the pizza. Wale said ""aint no pizza. get out"" 

&gt;So we did. We had no food and no place to stay so we just slept in Corp's cousin's car (he drove it up there) then drove back to Boston the next morning. He kinda stopped rapping after that and we don't talk much.

He was in the game 10 years before releasing his first album. His first appearance was with Jaz-O on songs like The Originators"" and ""Hawaiian Sophie"". Jay's name actually comes from Jaz.

**Features before Reasonable Doubt**:

[1994] [**Big Daddy Kane ft. Scoob, Sauce Money, Shyheim, *Jay-Z*, Ol' Dirty Bastard - Show And Prove**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpMpjrxNhB4): This was Jigga's first exposure to the public pretty much. At that point he was referred to as BDK's hypeman.

[1995] [**Big L ft. *Jay-Z*, Lord Finesse, Microphone Nut, Party Arty &amp; Grand Daddy I.U - Da Graveyard**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFHkNRjSVpA): This was a pretty popular posse cut with young Hov on it.

[1996] **Reasonable Doubt**: Unable to find a record deal, Jay-Z and Dame Dash created Roc-A-Fella Records. Reasonable Doubt is highly regarded as a classic. It features prouction from DJ Premier and DJ Clark Kent and a Biggie feature. Here are some tracks from it (don't ask me why I didn't include ____ because they're all really good except for the Foxy Brown joint). Also Friend or Foe is essentially DMX's flow.

- [Dead Presidents II](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYIsa_u_C-s)

- [D'Evils](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mnyBp4FzzI)

- [Brooklyn's Finest ft. Biggie Smalls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_DLD7OMUns)

[1997] **In My Lifetime, Vol 1**: I believe Hov said that this is his worst album but it's got some solid tracks on it. This was release shortly after Big's death and Hov was going through things. It features the worst hook ever on I Know What Girls Like but it's got some good tracks.

- Intro: [A Million &amp; One Questions / Rhyme No More](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcIrmNGUKUs): The beats on this intro are incredible, some of my favorite of all time, it was produced by DJ Premier. You may recognize the opening line after the beat switch from Pusha T's [Numbers On The Board](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DawrlSwHUiM).

- [You Must Love Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K661a-78iI): This songs deep it's one of those ""I'm a piece of shit"" tracks.

- [Rap Game/Crack Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu0nhEuw5vc): In this track Jay compares the rap game to the crack game. The hook is a Nas sample and a OutKast sample. It's an interesting parallel, concepts like this make dope songs.

**Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life** - This album is a step up from Vol. 1. It featues hit single, ""Hard Knock Life"" and some good songs. This is the album that made Jay-Z a household name.

- [Hard Knock Life (The Ghetto Anthem)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxtn6-XQupM)

- [Nigga What, Nigga Who ft. Jaz &amp; Amil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyXnkiCFYu8): This a fast paced track and the last Jay-Z track to feature his mentor, Jaz.

- [A Week Ago ft. Too Short](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YKYtTE-aQ0): This song is about snitch and it's a story and he references it in HAM.

**Vol. 3: The Life &amp; Times Of S. Carter**: This album is pretty good. It features one of the biggest Jay-Z songs, ""Big Pimpin"". It's probably the best ""Vol."" album. This album features really fresh sounding production featuring Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, and Premo.

- [Big Pimpin ft. UGK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgoqrgc_0cM): This song is perfect. Timbaland murdered the beat. Pimp C's verse is amazing.

- [So Ghetto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmsAw7xrcKM): Premier killed it on this beat and Jay does his thing.

- [Jay-Z Ft. Amil, Beans &amp; Bleek - Pop 4 Roc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nxbu0er1gk)

**The Dynasty: Roc La Familia**: This was supposed to be a compilation and pretty much is. It's sort of like Jay's Cruel Summer with him on every track. It catches a lot of flack but a lot of the tracks have great production. This album has AMAZING production, it has a Kanye West beat (the one mentioned in Last Call), Just Blaze and The Neptunes. He actually puts on Beanie Sigel as opposed to Bleek's whack ass.

- [1-900-Hustler ft. Jay-z, Memphis Bleek, and Freeway](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAk7QUCe9f0): This is such a dope concept and the beat is FUCKING AMAZING. This is one of my favorite Jay-Z songs.

- [I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8o_9RliwU): This is one of Jay's most successful singles. It's produced by The Neptunes and  Pharrell's immortal voice is on the hook.

- [This Can't Be Life ft. Beans &amp; Scarface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq4LzBcL70w): This is a Kanye beat. Jay get pretty deep on this one.

**The Blueprint**: This is Jay-Z's 2nd classic album. Released on 9/11/01. It's an undisputed classic. Featuring production from Timbaland, Yeezy and Just Blaze. Every song is at least good.

- [Takeover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMHtwyrt2X0): This is better than Ether in my opinion. It's a fucking amazing diss, it's classic. The the Bowie samples (""FAAAAME""), the math thing with Nas, he annihilated Mobb Deep and Nas. The last line is just perfect.

- [Heart Of The City](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QePjIIBI-sI): This song is perfect. The sample is perfect, Jigga's swagger is off the fucking charts, one of the best songs ever.

- [Song Cry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5srnNrICJo): This song is deep, I think someone called it ""Drake before Drake"" and I think that describes it pretty well, the beat is perfect, it's strange to see that Just Blaze, the king of bangers, produced this.

- [Jay-Z ft. Eminem - Renegade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjXqiwu30FQ): This is an amazing song. People say that Jay got destroyed on this track but I don't believe that. Em's verse is more in your face and full of overt punchlines while Hova's verse is more of multliple entendre lines that can only be appreciated by taking a closer look. They both killed it.

- I want to talk about more songs but I feel like it's essentially going to be a track-by-track if I do so ON TO THE NEXT ONE

**The Blueprint^2**: Admittedly I haven't listen to this album much. But I recently listened to it again to prepare for Magnet Carter Holy Grail. It's pretty good, it's no Blueprint and I think it was a really bad idea to name it after that sort of like F&amp;L2 except it isn't a huge pile of shit. It's a double disc album, disc one, The Gift is more upbeat, party tracks and disc 2, The Curse, is the deeper stuff.

The Gift:

- [Excuse Me Miss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnDh0JhmaFw): Neptunes beat on this one. 

- [Poppin Tags ft. Killer Mike, Big Boi &amp; Twista](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZAR4z8uyq0): Big Boi kills the hook, everyone does their thing, esp. Kanye West on the beat.

- [The Bounce ft. Kanye West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITG08wtIvc): This is the first time Jay gets Kanye shine as a rapper and he does his thing. Timbaland on the beat.

The Curse:

- [U Don't Know Remix ft. M.O.P.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eq7cJO5q7g): This is exactly what this track was missing. MOP fucking rides the beat like MOP rides a beat. This track bangs a ridiculous amount. Just Blaze did his fucking thing on the beat.

- [Meet The Parents](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiytIrZWZd4): One of the deeper Jay-Z tracks. Just Blaze.

**The Black Album**: Classic #3. Jay-Z comes back with this one claiming that he's going to retire and fade to black. Every track is perfect. It features production from Just Blaze, Kanye West, The Neptunes, Eminem, and oddly enough, 9th Wonder. [Dangermouse's The Grey Album is the Black Album over Beatles samples, it's amazing.](http://www.weallwantsomeone.org/2012/11/29/download-a-remastered-version-of-the-grey-album/)

- [December 4th](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT5xzPAh63g): This song is perfect. I also really like the [Danger Mouse remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWDuqzc5q0) with the Beatles beat, it feels more personal and deep than the Just Blaze beat.

- [What More Can I Say](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJjK3IV3E0): This track is perfect. This is another example of Jay's ridiculous swagger levels. The hook is just perfect.

- [1st Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pc3kD2iV8w): This is Obama's favorite Jay-Z song and I understand that. Jigga's fast flow is great over this beat, which is just amazing.

I'm not going to mention for every song just listen to the album.

And then Jay-Z retired never to rap again.... JUST KIDDING

**Kingdom Come**: This is Jay-Z's comeback album, it's pretty mediocre for a comeback despite the Just Blaze, Dr. Dre, Kanye West, and Neptunes production.

- [Lost Ones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng02QSUiL8M): This track is deep. Piano samples are dope.

- [Show Me What You Got](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS4U-HAHwps): This beat is perfect. Just Blaze. I don't have words for how perfect this beat is.

**American Gangster**: This album is really good. It's pretty slept on but it's great. It's based on the movie American Gangster, which is also really dope.

- [No Hook](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdKQ4Q20w_0): One of the best Jay-Z tracks. It's pretty deep.

- [Roc Boys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Revmkhxu7dk): I'm a sucker for horns in beats. This track is perfect IMO. Jay's swagger is just great.

- [American Gangster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OozjGkLRGQQ): And of course it's not a Jay-Z album without a Just Blaze beat. This song is great.

**The Blueprint 3**: It appears Jay didn't learn his lesson his first time: don't make sequels to classics. But yeah, this is pretty mediocre. He puts on J. Cole so that's cool.

- [Death Of Autotune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWruiIjBmo): Strangely enough, this concept was conceived by Kanye West and they had to scrap all the autotune tracks prepared for this album. The guitar riff goes hard.

- [A Star Is Born ft. J. Cole](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE-BXBaGF9A): This is a cool concept. J. Cole is hungry as fuck on this.

- [On To The Next One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM1RChZk1EU): This beat goes hard. Jay does his thing on it. Fuck Swizz Beatz hate.

I haven't listen to MCHG yet. So this is going to be very overwheming, if this is your first time listening to Jay-Z listen to Reasonable Doubt-&gt;Blueprint-&gt;Black Album-&gt;all of the other albums chronologically.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1373027885.0,,bigboi1,True,t3_1hnz36,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1hnz36/you_crazy_for_this_one_guide_to_jayz/,

This festival (ironically called NASS) tends to cater to 16-18 year old dubstep fans with 2 stages and about 5 bands per stage. 

Anyway, I've wanted to see Nas live since I first listened to Illmatic so stayed near the front of the stage to catch Nas perform. I was stood up for around 4 hours before he eventually came on and what can I say... Dudes still the king of rap hands down, he played every track off Illmatic and on top of that played about 20 other tracks from different albums. He must've only been onstage for maybe an hour and a half but by far the best show I've been too

**And that's it!**  

Now I know some of you may be a little mad that your favorite album didn't make the cut.  Don't worry, as our sub continues to grow, we may make changes to the list in order to reflect the wishes of the users.  

For your enjoyment, here's a couple of fun facts about the voting:

1. You guys really do love that Kanye West fellow!  We put a cap of 3 albums per artist on this list so that we could have a varied list.  However, if we didn't cap how many albums an artist could have on the list, **Outside of Yeezus which came out a few weeks ago, Kanye West's entire discography would've made it.  Even Watch The Throne.** (Cruel Summer didn't make it but that's technically not his album, but all of his single albums made the initial cut).  In order for other artists to have some shine time, we took his top 3 most voted albums.  I hope that Kanye fellow knows he has such devoted fans here!  

2. According to you guys, 2006 was the best year of hip-hop in the last 12 years.  7 albums from 2006 made the list.  On the other hand, every high is followed by a low, with 2008 only having one album on the list.  

The sidebar will be updated once we finish the ""Classics"" voting which will also begin today.  Keep up the good work you guys!

1337957697.0,476,self.hiphopheads,u4j36,An analysis of race and hip-hop in 2012 aka “Why nobody likes white rappers”,homeboy5925,594,118,447,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/u4j36/an_analysis_of_race_and_hiphop_in_2012_aka_why/,"Have you ever in your life been to a hip-hop show (that wasn’t hood rap) that was majority black?  Have you ever noticed that an overwhelmingly large portion of rappers are black, but an overwhelmingly large portion of fans are white?  Have you ever noticed how people on r/hhh make fun of guys for having “white rapper syndrome” in which their “whiteness” is inherently seen as “whack?”  I think that in the age of Obama we’ve become so desensitized to race that we completely don’t notice shifts in cultural differences anymore. These questions perplexed the fuck outta me, so here’s my 2 cents on how this shit goes down:

Let’s start out with my first big question: why don’t people like white rappers?  It seems to me that the only white rappers who ever have legitimate mainstream success are white rappers that **don’t sound white.**  Action Bronson, MGK, Paul Wall, El-P, Despot, could all be mistaken as black people if you didn’t know any better.  Now there are obviously exceptions to this rule (Beastie Boys, Eminem, etc.) but those guys were just so exceptionally talented that there was no possible way anyone could ignore them.  If you’re going to be a white rapper and sound white, you have to be LEAGUES better than your black counterparts.  If you’re just as good as a black guy, people will gravitate towards the black guy first every time.  For example: what the fuck has Asher Roth done after his bro anthem “I love college?”  Most people would say nothing, but he’s actually released some pretty good shit.  Problem is, it isn’t *good enough* for people to pay attention to a white rapper.  He’s still got that I love College frat boy stigma on him and he’ll never be able to shake it.  Now  you all will probably list a bunch of underground white rappers that are good; I didn’t say white rappers can’t be good.  I just said they probably won’t have much mainstream success.  Macklemore is good but I will bet my life savings he will never sign to Young Money or win a VMA.  

(And before anyone mentions Mac Miller, I think it’s important to recognize that his success is not due to his rapping ability as it is his business savvy.  That kid is a hustler more so than any of you will ever know.  He had to work tooth and nail to get to where he’s gotten because of everything that I’ve already mentioned, and even he will have a ceiling to his success.  He’s not as crazy or as lyrically talented as Eminem, he just knows all the right people in the game.) 

But why is this?  Why the reverse racism?  Well it comes from a few places.  One of the reasons is that “swag” is one of the most important aspects to a rapper (I know, I hate that word too, but it has existed pre OF).  The way you walk, talk, dress, and act are just as important as your actual technical ability.  A lot of the white rappers I’ve seen posted here tend to put all of their effort into the rapping aspect and totally forget the personality part.  For example: Mac Lethal is an extremely technically gifted rapper, but him as a person bores the fuck out of most people.  All of this is due to the fact that stereotypically black people are seen as inherently “cooler” than white people.

This also explains why there are so many white hip-hop fans.  A couple of months ago I went to a Dead Prez show and I was easily one of maybe 10 black people there out of a venue with a couple hundred; and Dead Prez is EXTREMELY afrocentric group.  Why would a white person enjoy music talking poorly about them by artists that don’t like them? (there’s videos on the internet of Dead Prez calling out their white fans).  Seeing a group of white women singing every word to “I’m an African” was uplifting and puzzling as fuck at the same time.  Part of me wants to say it’s a good thing that we are able to put race behind us and come together, but at the same time I feel as if black people are losing their identity as a culture because everything we do gets absorbed by white culture.  Think if like white people started liking Salsa music and trying to speak Spanish and pretended that they were Hispanic; wouldn’t that feel weird?


In the United States during the post Civil War era, a type of live entertainment emerged called “Minstrel.”  A minstrel show was a performance done in front of an all white crowd by either a white cast in blackface or black people in blackface.  The show would consist of songs, dancing, and comedy.  All of the actors on stage would purposefully act like stereotypical slaves with low education; they would shuck and jive, make fun of each other, portray black people as lazy and unintelligent without the ability to take anything seriously and were pretty much good for nothing except dancing.  I think that some of the allure of modern hip-hop comes from the allure of the minstrel.  We like seeing black people act a fool.  It’s funny and its fun.  And the way these rappers get paid now, it’s not nearly as demeaning and people will line up to do it.  People will willingly trade in their pride and sense of self for money and bitches.  True warriors of the American self destructive hedonistic lifestyle. 

But a white person can’t be in a minstrel unless they wear blackface.  That’s why white rappers will always get shitted on.  Put on your blackface first, learn to shuck and jive, go through some things, then maybe I’ll fuck with your tape.  But there is nothing about being middle class and suburban that interests anyone ever.

I know this is tl;dr as fuck but his subreddit is a perfect microcosm of the hip-hop scene at large and I think that this is a topic that deserves to be talked about more often.  Can a genre that was born out of afrocentricity become bigger than the black race and still maintain it’s authenticity?

I don't know where else this goes, but there's these guys from Sydney who make hip hop in Australia called Horrorshow. They're two dudes and they're vaguely famous (in Australia) for doing their thing. Prepare for a long post that you're free to ignore.

Anyway, I first ran into their music a few years back when they had this track called [No Rides Left](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls8mmFm0_Ew). It was a dope track and one of the songs that made me investigate hip hop. These days I listen to everything from Delta to Danny Brown and DMX but Horrorshow's been my favorite act since I heard that track. The reason is simply that their music speaks to me. Maybe it's an Australian thing. Maybe it's an adolescent thing. Maybe it's a white people thing. I don't fucking know, but I know that their music says something to me.

These guys have never put out a bad track in my opinion. Everything they've released has been dope. There's a couple of tracks on The Grey Space that are sort of slow, but aside from that, I don't think there's one song that I haven't listened to at least 50 times. Yes, I'm a Stan. But I want to share this artist with you. It's hard to explain but this dude Solo, the MC, makes people listen. Inside Story's amazing. It's all on youtube and that. I'm not telling you to buy shit, this is reddit.

I was going through a really dark phase earlier this year, like, seriously considering sticking my neck in a noose the week before my 19th birthday. It was walking through the park and listening back to their first album that I sat down on a bench and started sobbing like a bitch. For anyone who's been through serious, dark depression, that minute when it breaks after months of absolute torture and lethargy burst, and you decide to take the advice of the few people that give a fuck about you and get some serious help - that's the minute that Horrorshow got me to.

I'm not saying that this [stupid fucking song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GfPXfG6x7k) got me out of my depression, but I don't know if I would have broken it without the help of their music. This is what made me say ""yeah I'll take the advice of my family and friends and make an effort to fix this instead of throwing away my shitty life"".

Anyway, this wall o' text deserves to get buried, but TLDR: Horrorshow are mad cunts and they've helped me (and a bunch of other people) through some really bad times and I respect them for that.

* ask questions about stuff on the essentials lists
* ask questions you might think are dumb 
* find new music you might like
* find songs from people you're just now getting into
* get educated about the genre we all love

* ask questions your self (you know you got some)

* spread some love for your favorite emcee
* post shit from the essentials list (sweet sweet karma)
* help the HHH community get more educated (better discussions)
* help some newbies
* clear up confusions you see alot that get you frustrated

...results below

I know I’m not alone when I say that 2012 was one of the most exciting years for hip-hop in recent memory. Some of the artists we were intrigued by last year turned into stars, others we had never heard of captured our ears, and some of the legends continued to flex their muscles as well. 

While all this was going on, our little subreddit exploded. 

A few weeks ago, I invited you all to nominate categories for the awards. A week later, HHHers voted on the nominees for each category in /r/HHHawards. Last week, you were all invited to cast your votes in a Google Doc form that I posted on here. In total, almost 3000 HHHers participated in the vote.

Some people were upset about the fact that the nominees in each category were defined by the time the vote came around. Others were upset about the lack of diversity in the nominees. You wanted to vote for *your* favorites, and that wasn’t possible because organizing 3000 responses to open-ended questions would be a nightmare (for me).

I understand your frustration.

I grudgingly voted for *Blue Chips* for the Best Mixtape Award, knowing full well that *Trap Back* was the hardest tape of the year (you know it too). I was content with voting for *Birthday Song* for Best Music Video, but in my heart the award belonged to MIA’s *Bad Girls*.

I initially saw the awards as a failure. Now I see them as symbols of success. 

If we didn’t have over 50,000 subscribers who are so passionate about this music, we could have done an open-ended vote. If hip-hop in 2012 wasn’t so diverse, nobody would complain about the lack of variety in nominees. If hip-hop in 2012 wasn’t so engaging, we would have stopped arguing with each other months ago.

I know that hip-hop will continue to evolve in 2013, and that we will continue to gather here to listen and laugh together.

I know he's blowing up and the fact that i'm saying he was good isn't a new opinion, but the show he put on last night was something else. 

It was just him and his DJ but they gave off MAD energy, had the whole crowd wiling out - he spat some acapella stuff i never heard too. But it was the positivity that everyone felt that hit me, dude was humble as fuck, modest and so good. Dude gave me a night i won't forget in a long time.

1355334050.0,408,self.hiphopheads,14qg2x,The (Un)Official Census of Game's Name drops on Jesus Piece,RampanTThirteen,458,50,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/14qg2x/the_unofficial_census_of_games_name_drops_on/,"Inspired by the massive amounts of posts this past week about Jesus piece, I have taken it upon myself to count all the name drops that The Game does on Jesus Piece. 

The Rules: Only names of famous individuals count, not references to brands, albums, songs or sports teams. Only verses from Game himself count, obviously. I used the iTunes deluxe version for the purposes of the count.



**The Results/Awards:**


*Total Name Drops*: 113


*Name Drops per song*: 7.53


*Most Name Dropped Person:* : Jay-Z, with 7 name drops. Honorable Mentions: 50 Cent with 5, Kanye with 5, Nas with 4, K. Dot with 4, 2Pac with 4, Dr Dre with 4

*Best Historical Name Drop:* Nelson Mandela


*Best Sports Name Drop:* Specifically ending a song with ""Let me end this song with a shout out to James Harden"". Because Game, you clearly need to let people know that you are about to shout someone out, its not like you've been doing that for the whole album...

*Worst Name Drop:* ""Frank Ocean more of a man than you""


*Most Random Shoutout:* Carlos Santana. Honorable Mentions: Bono, Avatar, John Wilkes Boothe, Usain Bolt.



All in all, it was a solid name dropping out from Game, especially since on so many songs he only had one verse because of all the guests so he has less time for the name-dropping. He covered a lot of territory on Jesus Piece. I believe ""Can't Get Right"" had the most name-drops per capita, so hopefully he can take that strong form and bring that same name-dropping fire to his next album.

Addendum: I feel I should clarify that I actually like The Game, and enjoyed this album. This is by no means a knock on the dude, just purely for fun.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1355338579.0,,jets2,True,t3_14qg2x,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/14qg2x/the_unofficial_census_of_games_name_drops_on/,

Naturally I was shameless and started to hit on girls like crazy since they'd never see me again. Most girls that seemed interested were lookin' like Freddy Jackson, so I kept migrating around trying to find a sexy one that would give it up. There was one in particular who was pretty hot (dat ass omg) and she seemed pretty uninterested at first, but we were making conversation, just laughing it up.

Somehow we got on the topic of Reddit and she said she loved that website blah blah blah. Perfectly timed by the hip-hop Gods, my party anthem came on and I started singing random parts of Ignition and she seemed to be getting a little more into me since we were dancing and she liked my singing, but it still wasn't enough. Shit, it was a start tho.

So we're still talking about Reddit after my song finished and she asked me which subreddit is my favorite. Naturally /r/hiphopheads is my favorite, I'm here like five hours a day. So I told her that *and,* in my drunken stupor, that I mod it... Which I do not. She asked what my name was, so I panicked and said to look up /u/dhaft88 LOL I started to brag about ""me"" being the mod of one of the bigger subs and all 80,000 knew and liked me. And because of how impressed she was with that, I rolled with it. I told her to look me up. Hopefully she forgot who ""I"" (dhaft) was so she won't know that I'm not dhaft. But even if she finds out, I'll never see her, so ain't no thang.

Anyways, after I told her that, she seemed super interested in me and I went in for the kill and killed it. We found ourselves a room and she didn't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind, so did it face down ass up, cause that's the way I like to fuck.

So shouts out to my main man /u/dhaft88 ^^^^^who ^^^^^still ^^^^^owes ^^^^^me ^^^^^a ^^^^^flair ^^^^^and ^^^^^Irish ^^^^^Car ^^^^^Bombs for being a bomb ass wingman and not even being there. &lt;3

&gt;That’s between you and whoever else’s dick it is

&gt;Pause, maybe that line was too far

&gt;Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are

&gt;And who can blame ya?”


**Cole's explanation:**

&gt;""There will soon come a day when people in general, and rap artists specifically, are going to have to answer for their past usage of the word ‘faggot,’ much like the Grandfathers who are ashamed that they used the word ‘nigger’ as kids. At a time when public acceptance of gay rights is soaring (rightfully), hip-hop culture and general are still battling with homophobia (not excluding myself). Rather than run from it I chose to attack it playfully. Those lyrics are meant to make everyone uncomfortable for the sake of this very conversation.”

**Can you speak on your favorite track on Born Sinner?**

**Can you speak on your production process you took on Born Sinner?**

*EDITING THIS ONE IN AS IT'S RELEVANT: [link here](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1gved1/hi_im_j_cole_ama/cao7afw)*

&gt;First answer! Favorite song is too hard to decide. But I will say Runaway is definitely in the running. The verses!

&gt;Production process is an easier question to answer for me. I just let it FLOW. Normally I start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance, Runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop, then adding a harder kick on top. Once i get drums that Move me and excite me, I look to add music (samples or something i'm playing) that make the marriage complete. 

&gt;Born sinner plays with a lot of Double time tempo's. Shit like power trip, that moves your head as if it's fast paced. but in reality, its technically a SLOW beat. The breakdown on LAnd of the Snakes another example. Or rich niggaz. 

&gt;thanks for the question

---

**Hearing that you're a big Outkast fan i'll ask you this; ATLiens or Aquemini?**

&gt;DAMN. That's tough. But Aquemini.

---

**What is one musician you love that most people would not expect you to listen to?**
&gt;Eric Clapton.

---
**1. Why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on Born sinner?**

**2. When can we expect your collab album with Kendrick?** 

&gt;Thank you! By the time I was wrapping up the album, I started doing interviews and getting questions about features. I didn't have any rap features, and I felt pressure to ADD some, but quickly realized that I had already said what I wanted to say on this album. The mentality was ""who says you HAVE to have other people rapping on your album?""

&gt;Don't want to put a date on it.

---

**What do you think about Waka and Gucci beefing? I really want a Ferrari Boyz 2**

&gt;Thank you. But don't listen to projections. No guarantee that I reach that #.  Either way I'm grateful.

&gt;Thanks for listening to Born Sinner.

&gt;About Waka and Gucci beefing. I remember one time when there was a rumor about them beefing for real, and Waka had said something about Gucci. The next day I was in Atlanta and went to the club, they were both there and kicking it like there was no problem. (Gucci had the meannn yellow Lambo outside) 

&gt;I say all that to say, to me it seems like they're really just Family and you know family fights sometimes but it's not REAL beef. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW, i'm just light skinned

---
**Did she [your mom] know that your heart was set on rapping the whole time?**

&gt;1. I'm sure my Mom wanted me to go be a lawyer and do something ""safe."" Just the fact that I went to college was already making her so proud. She knew I was heavy into music, but I don't think she knew how serious I took it until college graduation was coming up and she would hit me with the  ""soooo honey, what are you gonna do now?"" questions. And when I hit her with the super confident ""I'm about to go and get signed"" answers. She never told me NOT to, but she definitely tried to encourage me to take the safer path. ""you sure you don't want to go law school? you would be a great lawyer"" NAW MOMMA YOU ALREADY TOLD ME I CAN DO ANYTHING

---

**Have you received any feedback (positive/negative) about your “Faggot” bars on Villuminati?**

&gt;yes. i'm a communications major, studied PR. I knew what I was getting into. The comment I gave to Huffington Post was genuine and the reason why I wrote those bars. The line even makes me uncomfortable, but it's worth it for the sake of the conversation.

**Also, since it just came out - what are your initial reactions and thoughts on [Made Nas Proud]( http://www.audiomack.com/song/nas/let-nas-down-remix-feat-nas)?**

**Thanks for doing the AMA!**

&gt;MADE NAS PROUD IS A HUGE MOMENT FOR ME. today is my first day off. can't wait to soak in the moment after this. did i already say that to someone? i think i did.

&gt;thank you for the words, i'm glad the music connected with you. THANK YOU.

&gt;I'm going to watch a movie tonight (man of steel or this is the end), i don't get to do normal shit much I'm always working. I play ball as much as possible, which isn't much anymore. From 3 times a week 5 years ago, to once a month MAYBE now

---

**Did you get the album title from Juicy? Or how did that come about?**

&gt;album title came from the line i wrote, ""born sinner, was never born to be perfect"" which inspired the amazing hook to ""Born Sinner"" written by James Fauntleroy. And of course the BIGGIE line represents all UNDERDOGS. ""Born Sinner, the opposite of a winner""

---

**Much love from Jamaica, man! You out'chea!**

**My questions are: What's the most personal/most difficult to record song that you've ever done? Also, what song are you most proud of?**

&gt;crooked smile was the most work i've ever put into a song. it started as a mixtape sounding song (i should just drop that shit on reddit today) and grew into an incredible single with meaning and message. was hard to find the perfect writing for the 2nd and 3rd verses. and the amount of work me and elite put into the production is crazy

---
**Do you have any future plans to work with him again?**
**I like to think of rappers who double as producers as ambidextrous. Do you think this skill gives you an edge over other artists who don't?**

&gt;ambidextrous. interesting way to look at it. the edge that i have over other artists as a rapper/producer is that I depend on myself to craft my own sound. So many people want me to go work with the producers who are determining hip hop's CURRENT commercial sound and criticize me for using my own beats. But like it or not, this is MY sound. No one else's. 

&gt;the rapper side of me does look forward to the day when he doesn't have to sit around and wait for the producer side to make a beat he likes. 

&gt;the producer side of me does look forward to making beats for somebody other than J. Cole, who doesn't always get him.

&gt;make sense? probably not?

---

**I would like to know what was your rap career like before your big move to New York?**

&gt;i had 2 identities. To my friends and to the people I knew around the city, I was just jermaine or ""cole."" But then we would be coming from the club and stop at the gas station, and somebody would be like ""oh shit! therapist what up!""

&gt;That's because there was a Rap community in Fayetteville that I was also apart of. They knew me by my rap name and my affiliation with Bomm Sheltuh (my mentors). I was the young kid that was NASTY on the mic.

&gt;Batman - Bruce Wayne


---

**Is there a story behind you showing up at the Roots/Chappele concert? Also now that you are where you are why hasn't there been a J.Cole/Roots colab?**

&gt;YEA.

&gt;Sophomore year of college. Long story short (aka this is gonna be long) I heard about this secret Dave Chapelle concert, you had to register and sign up online to go. The Roots, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Mos Def, Kweli, Kanye, Dead Prez.

&gt;They sent me confirmation back and it was on. Took my homeboy and roomate with me. BUT. Woke up that morning at 6 am to leave, and it was POURING. Some Hurricane level shit. We looked at each other like, ""damn dawg, we really gonna do this?""

&gt;Said fuck it and got dressed. Had to walk to the bus stop in the rain, then wait on the bus in the rain. Now we're Soaked. Hopped off the bus, hopped on the train. Took the train to the bottom of Manhattan to the secret ""Meet Up"" point. Some random Grocery store by the Water.

&gt;We were the first ones there. People showed up over the next couple of hours. Then finally, they put us all on these yellow school buses to take us to the real secret concert location. A random block in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn.

&gt;Best show I ever been to in my life. Fugees reunited on stage, Lauryn Hill was incredible. Plus the line up was crazy. I was just a fan of this shit. still am

&gt;Then you could see me on the movie, everybody was hitting me from back home like ""YOOO HOW THE FUCK YOU GET IN THIS MOVIE?? I'M IN THE THEATRE NOW I SWEAR I JUST SEEN YOU""

&gt;too long? whoops

---

**I saw you perform at the Miami show a few days back and let me tell you that waiting those 12 hours was definitely worth the performance, thank you.**

**What is it like seeing all the turnout and support for the A Dollar And A Dream shows? Will you do a proper tour for Born Sinner soon?**

&gt;that show was amazing to see. thank you for waiting. Fire Marshall's almost shut that down, too many people showed up. 4thousand people outside trying to get in.

&gt;That show, and this tour in general, made me love and appreciate Hip Hop even more. 

&gt;The best part is to be on stage with people looking you directly in the eyes rapping word for word to songs that shaped a part of their lives. Got them through high school, or college, or helped them deal with a loss or a break up, or feel better about themselves, or convinced them to go to school, or to not give up on some shit they believed in. Rap music can do that?

---

**Even though you've come so far in the industry, there's still a very apparent 'under dog' tone to your music. What forces specifically do you feel like you're a pawn to, even at your position? What struggles do you find define your career at this stage?**

&gt;Good question.

&gt;There is still an underdog tone, because I still feel like one. Everything about my story and my journey is so unlikely. The odd's of me being in the position I am now, and of me being on my way to where I'm trying to go, are not in my favor. Being a small city kid from NC, in a rap game where everybody's either from NYC, CHI, LA, ATL, HOUSTON, MIAMI, even TORONTO is still a Major city.

A few months ago, I was named valedictorian of my class, meaning that I would have to give a speech at graduation this Sunday. In order to add some humor and originality to my speech, I was going to include a (relevant) Kanye quote. It was ""Look at the valedictorian, scared of the future"". I then used that as a launching point to say that we shouldn't be scared of the future, but rather excited instead. Well, the administration of my school didn't like this. I go to a Catholic school and therefore the principal thought it would be inappropriate to have a Kanye reference in my speech based on who he is. Therefore, he is making me remove it. So, out of frustration, I came here to vent about the stupid censorship of the one and only Yeezy in my speech. I tried arguing in person with the vice principal, but she didn't budge. I also sent a strongly worded email to the principal and vice principal with valid reasons as to why I should be allowed to keep Kanye in my speech. Hopefully they will fix this outrage. Praise Yeezus.

/rant

EDIT: THE BATTLE IS WON. The principal has decided to let me keep Kanye in my speech. He really liked my email as he thought I did a good job of making valid points and a reasonable argument. We had a meeting today that went very well and concluded with him saying that in the context of the speech, there is nothing wrong with referencing Kanye and that my quote actually ties in well with the message that I am giving.

Obviously, I'm cool with them leaving on the hook or even backup vocals (i.e. doubles) over the beat -- but a lot of cats leave their *entire verses* on their live tracks, essentially just rapping along to their own vocals.

At their laziest, I've even seen some rappers (e.g. A$AP Rocky, Big Sean) do only the *ad-libs* during certain songs while the full verses play on the track.  Of course, no one in the crowd seemed to care because they were too blazed or caught up on swag.

Call me old fashioned, but I go to shows to see *musicianship,* not the live equivalent of a YouTube cover.

Am I just too old for this shit?

""Macklemore is good but I will bet my life savings he will never sign to Young Money or win a VMA."" 

Looks like I'm about to be out of a life savings.

I don't think any of us saw Macklemore coming.  Macklemore is probably the first rapper to perfectly cater to that non-rap fan crowd.  Nobody else ever thought those people could be converted into rap fans.  When I made my original post, I was speaking from the perspective of a rap fan, to other rap fans.  Macklemore saw that his viability in traditional markets was limited, so he threw a big middle finger to yall and went straight for the jugular: house moms.  Nobody could've called that.

If you're in the Cincinnati/NKY/Dayton area and you don't yet have a ticket, I will deliver one to you.

If ten do, I'll try to crowdsurf and will likely make an epic failure of myself and my spine in the process. Since I'm an [alt-rap emcee](http://evanlind.bandcamp.com) (inspired most by Cecil Otter and Metermaids), I'll probably get booed off the stage, which should be exciting too.

1358464594.0,374,self.hiphopheads,16s52r,Pitchfork's handling of Chief Keef is a prime example of why hipsters and the hood don't mix.,homeboy5925,761,387,495,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/16s52r/pitchforks_handling_of_chief_keef_is_a_prime/,"Now, some of you already have your opinions on the racial and cultural undertones that surround the hipster community's embrace of hood rap.  I'm not even going to get into that conversation because its been had before.  I'm simply talking about the incident that got Sosa in jail; Pitchfork taking him to a gun range.

Now, dry snitching aside, taking a kid from an area of Chicago that just had 500 murders to a gun range like that shit is edgy or cool might be one of the most morally apprehensive moves I've ever seen a journalist take.  But then when I really think about it, I highly doubt Pitchfork was even aware at the time that what they were doing was fucked up.

*They didn't even consider it*.  That's even more dangerous than malice.  That's ignorance.  Ignorance to a guy's situation.  Ignorance to a city (which you're fucking based in) and a culture.  Anyone who knew anything would've been like ""hey taking a kid on probation for pointing a gun at a cop to a gun range might not be cool.""  Anyone who knows shit about being on probation or knows anyone who has ever been on probation would've told them to stop from the inception of that idea.  

This is why hipsters and the hood don't mix.  Hipsters aren't actually cool, they're just rejecting their privilege in a search for authenticity in a world in which everything is handed to them (I know all about hipsters I watch Girls).  In search of that they end up places that they shouldn't be.  They have this child-like wonder to everything, but they also are child-like in the sense that they have no sense of history or context.  They view the world with a Rose tint, something that was never afforded to Keef or anyone like him.  

tl;dr Pitchfork is knowingly and willingly fetishizing all the bad parts of  hood culture for their own enjoyment, perpetuating stereotypes that we have worked so hard to try and get rid of for decades.

*P.S.  This is not an attack on fans of Keef's music.  Nothing wrong with being 3hunna.  But have the ability to separate music, man, and culture.  They are all different and need to be treated differently.*

**Edit:  Apparently I pissed off the hipsters.  I am more than aware that in 2013 if you don't wear Crocs and jorts you're basically a hipster but who I am referring to specifically are:**

**- Middle to upper class, college educated, suburban raised people aged 18-35 who have had little to no interaction with poor communities in their lifetime and have started listening to hip-hop within the last 5 years**

**Double edit:  To all the hipsters with rustled jimmies who are trying to turn this into a ""you hate white people"" thing, go county how many times the phrase ""white people"" is used in my OP.  Go count how many times I bring up race.  Go.  Quit trying to break everything down into some dumb shit.  Quit bringing up race when you don't have an argument.**",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1358525258.0,,homeboy,True,t3_16s52r,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/16s52r/pitchforks_handling_of_chief_keef_is_a_prime/,

I think that this has been a really exciting time for HHH with all of the music that dropping this year, and things like the J. Cole AMA happening, but I also feel that HHH had declined in some aspects, mainly the quality/thoughtfulness of a lot of posts and comments that I have seen recently. 
The amount of stanning, bandwagoning, and posting of opinions as if they are fact seems to be at an all-time high in this subreddit in my opinion, and I just feel like everyone needs to do a better job of thinking before they post. I'm so tired of posts where people argue about what's the best song or which of these albums/rappers are better than the other. Music, hip-hop included, is fucking subjective. Nothing is the best. I'm not saying we shouldn't have debates or that you shouldn't argue in support of a rapper if you're a big fan, but I just ask that we all keep it civil, insightful, and thoughtful. Don't be a condescending fuck when you reply to someone's comment just because you disagree, and don't come on here seeking some validation or credibility for your own opinions. We're all just anonymous hip-hop fans on here and no one's words carry more weight than anyone else's. 

I would like to see less gossip,less bashing of opinions you don't agree with, less what's the best/who would win/what the worst-type posts that pose dumb hypothetical questions, and more free-flowing conversations, more ""favorite"" instead of ""best,"" and more ""I think"" inserted at the beginning of your comment and explaining why you feel that way.

As HHH continues to grow it could be real easy for the content on here to go to shit and I don't want that to happen. And sorry if this came off as too negative. This is my favorite subreddit, and the best place to go for all things hip-hop, so I just want everyone on here to keep the standard for content high. Just try to keep it real goddammit, that's all I ask. 

TL;DR: Keep this shit g

Sorry for the rant

EDIT: My booty hurts after reading some of these comments. Seriously though y'all are making some really good points and changing how I look at some of this. And I'm really not trying to be a ""lurker"" who comes out and shits on everything, I just wanted to speak my mind on what I've been seeing and see what people had to say about it. I was serious when I said this is my favorite subreddit, I'm on here everyday and do really think it's the best place for all things hip-hop so I didn't mean to sound like I hate everything about it. I've said enough though, all I can say is that I'm glad for all the discussion, and I'll try to be more active in the future and be better about taking the good with the bad",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1372267960.0,,,True,t3_1h3gtl,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1h3gtl/can_we_talk_about_hhh_for_a_minute/,

I'm sure that it will be a massive fiscal success, but it's just plain, uninspired hip hop. New rules? Fuck Hov, all you did was sign a pre-release contract with a cellphone company to help promote *their* product. Those aren't new rules. That's the same old self-promoting shit that's been lining rappers pockets for the past decade. I'm not disappointed, and I'm not complaining. This is a good album. I'll bump it loud for a few weeks, but then I'll put it on the shelf and look towards some fresh MC's for these so-called new rules... and before y'all call me out on it. No, I did not have inflated expectations for this album like I had for Yeezus, but I was expecting a little more than the unremarkable product that we got.

Do you like rappers?  Do you think the rapper lifestyle is cool and/or glamorous? Do you jerk off to Dilla beats?  Does Dance with the Devil make you cry? Thinking about taking up rapping?  Well, from all of your friends at HHH, I would like to give you the following advice:

**Don't.  Please.**

One thing that I have learned from posting on this website and being involved in hip-hop in general is that for every good or listenable rapper, there are THOUSANDS of embarrassingly bad rappers.  And I don't mean like, guys who have potential who just need some more practice and experience.  I mean like, guys who simply do not know what the fuck they are doing, do not know how to make good hip-hop, and are hip-hop's equivalent to tone deaf. Like, cringeworthy rappers.  And for some reason, all of them like to spam this subreddit with their music.  

I think that a big problem is that nobody has ever cut it to them straight. Your mom and your girlfriend will always say you're good. There is no ""how to make hip-hop"" book that you can just read.  You can't take rapping classes at your local music store; it is a completely self taught thing.  The problem is that a lot of people teach themselves how to rap without knowing shit about hip-hop, and those 2 things combined just create some horrible shit.  What I'm going to attempt to do is to try to help some of you plebs out.  You can take my advice, or you can not take my advice.  I really don't give a diggity damn.  I just feel like a couple of basics need to be addressed for all of these suburban computer mic and garageband rappers.

***If everyone says you suck, you probably suck.*** If you find yourself having to defend your music all the time, there's probably a reason why.  Now, your music will never appeal to everyone.  Everyone is different, everyone listens to hip-hop for different reasons.  But when your problems are straight up substantive, you need to go back to the drawing board. Guys always like to come up with some excuse for why nobody fucks with their shit.  

“Oh, my style is just unique.”  No, it's ass.  It's not enjoyable to listen to, to anyone, ever. 

“I'm more concerned about getting my message across.”  Protip bro, nobody gives a shit about your message.  Nothing you are saying is that thought provoking to the point where someone will put up with shitty music just to hear your fucking “message.”  Please, step off the high horse and off the nearest cliff.

***This is not a hobby, this is a lifestyle.***  In order to be a good rapper, you have to completely rearrange the way that you think.  You have to think in rhyme, analyze in rhyme.  Bars have to keep you up at night.  You have to eat sleep and shit that shit. You have to be a student of not only the music, but the culture in and of itself.  What a lot of cats don't realize is that to make good hip-hop, you have to know about more than just hip-hop.  You **HAVE TO** be a renaissance man.  You have to be well read, well traveled, articulate and social.  Your personality is extremely important.  Your personality comes out in your bars, and if you aren't a personable and knowledgeable person, nobody is gonna give a shit what you have to say. Rapping isn't like other genres.  In other genres it really doesn't matter who the person is playing the guitar is; if they're good, they're good.  Hip-hop is a lot more personal.  If you're not a cool dude, you probably won't make a cool rapper.  If you're the awkward neckbeard redditor, you will suck.  Guaranteed.

If your first hip-hop album was My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I would suggest you never pick up a mic ever or at least for another 10 years.  You will suck, hard.  It takes YEARS to be able to be listenable, just like any other musical exploit.  You can't just pick up a guitar and play for a couple of months and then expect to start booking gigs.  Fuck no, those guys do that shit their entire lives, and hip-hop is the same.  Either you got talent, or you don't.  If you don't, deal with it.  There is no conspiracy against you.

***Beat selection is more important than you fucks will admit.***  Please, PLEASE stop rapping on bad beats.  PLEASE.  Nobody will even bother to listen to your bars if you get on a shitty beat/an overused beat.  Be original man, J Dillas's discography has suffered enough from shitty rappers desecrating his shit.  Leave Shook Ones Pt. II the fuck alone for the love of god.  If you are not from the UK, do not rap on fucking dubstep.  Please.  Most dubstep isn't even made to be rapped on; hip-hop instrumentals leave space for rappers, dubstep beats do not.  Know the fucking difference. 

There are beats everywhere, producers everywhere.  A lot of which are more than willing to give you their shit for free, just for the added exposure.  If nobody is willing to throw you a beat, you probably suck.  There are bangers in every fucking corner of the world, it's just all about how much time you're willing to put into finding them.  Do not rap on everything, it's not worth it.

***When I tell you that you're shit, don't get defensive.***  Just take it as motivation, improve, and prove me wrong one day.  You aren't going to win fans by being a whiny bitch when everyone says you're ass. 

***Presentation is everything.***  Do not give me a sob story about how shitty your life is and how rapping is how you express yourself.  Note to self bro: that's everyone's fucking story.  I don't care.  Nobody cares.  Does it bang?

I don't care if your shit sounds like shit from the '90s.  Whenever I see that, I automatically think ""This beat is gonna be simplistic and overdone, with basic bars.""  Guys, THE 90'S ARE OVER.  YEA, THEY WERE GOOD.  BUT IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.  LET IT DIE.  Nobody wants to hear shit from the 90's anymore.  Not that it wasn't good, but its been fucking done before.  If you're a rock band, you aren't gonna have much success going up to people and being like ""yo man we're basically the new Pink Floyd.""  Dude, Pink Floyd was great, but it's been done.  Do something that hasn't been done before.  Be fucking original.  Quit straight up copy pasting someone else's style from 20 years ago.

One last thing, specifically for this subreddit:  ***Nobody gives a shit if you're a white rapper.***  Nobody.  Being white in hip-hop does not make you original.  If you haven't noticed (you haven't), most hip-hop fans these days are white.  When you self identify as a white rapper, you're basically saying ""I'm not as good as the black guys so I'm going to separate myself from them so that people only judge me against other white rappers"", and if you do that, you're taking yourself out the game from the jump.

tl;dr kill yoself

**P.S. If my post rustled your jimmies, hip-hop ain't for you.  I'm not talking about the dudes who just rap or cypher or shit just for fun, I'm talking about the guys who actively create and put their shit out there and expect feedback.  If you don't like getting shitted on, you're in the wrong genre buddy.  We spend all day on this subreddit shitting on rappers with 100x the talent of any of you, so I don't know why we aren't supposed to be honest when you post your soundcloud raps.**",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1346152492.0,,homeboy,True,t3_ywpvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/ywpvn/the_phd_presents_so_you_wanna_be_a_rapper_huh/,

That shouldn't even be a question being that we're the largest hip-hop sub on here and as such our community is likely best-suited to host his AMA if he decides to go through with it. 

People don't have to agree on everything or like every artist; that's not expected, and we can bullshit amongst ourselves, circlejerk, hate on shit, and whatever else in other threads. 

When HHDX and XXL are mentioning us and other shit, that means we're makin a little noise and people visit this forum. A lot of us like the community here, some don't as much and that's cool, but I think for those that enjoy this board over others, it's safe to say that we don't want to make ourselves out to be assholes. 

**What we're asking from everyone:** 

When we have AMAs and things that involve people taking time out of there day to visit this forum and answer questions, please don't be a prick. If you don't care about the thread, the music, or the artist then just pass it up and add some commentary elsewhere and go about your business instead of trying to ""troll"" someone or be obnoxious. If you have a question or comment that may be unfavorable to these people and is actually related or relevant, but you still want to ask then figure out a way to do so in a mature, nonabrasive manner that isn't unnecissarily offensive. If you can't stop yourself from doin this then we'll remove your comments or ban you.

We just broke over 80k so there's a lot more post removal necessary and more people active, so if we have to ban a few people for being dickheads, then we'll do so and not worry about it - the sub will carry on without them. For the people worried about others from default subs being attracted here: so what? let them come and if they act/post/say shit that doesn't fit in here then they will soon find out that's not how we roll and will likely unsub or try to troll or just have a lot of downvotes - any of those are fine, they'll weed themselves out. There will always be a few cool cats that find there way here and like what they've found and fit in, and that's the better result. Either way, [we'll be fine](http://artistsofhiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/EMO-DRAKE.jpg). 

**TL;DR:** Yes, this is the internet where you can do what you want, but at least act maturely if we have ""guests."" Bullshit with each other and circlejerk in other threads, not AMAs. Don't worry about people from default subs, they'll weed themselves out if they don't fit in.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1368722847.0,,dhaft,True,t3_1egjq6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1egjq6/psa_in_regards_to_amas_and_bein_cool_to_each/,moderator

After review, critics would praise me for being clever and too lyrical for trap shit. 


The trap community would then start slowly start to shun me, calling me a fake and not about the life but my nigga Sosa would have my back through it all. Release 2 or 3 mixtapes, each becoming less trap with every release. Tensions are high within my clique, Sosa is also distancing himself from me but start becoming cool with some members of the beast coast. Finally, everything comes to a climax when I'm photoed at a Flatbush Zombies/Pro Era concert chillin with Tyler and some OF dudes.

Get dropped from GBE, Sosa releases a diss track called ""Never Hood"". Mediocre but whole community eats it up. Retaliate by releasing a 6 track EP with songs basically stating the rap wizard is nothing, i was carrying GBE, i fucked his mama etc. EP is critically acclaimed, critics eat it up and call it a classic. Get all record deal offers, YMCMB, GOOD, Roc, ecstatic as a bitch, drowning in money.

One day after leaving a party with some of the entourage, a car pulls up besides me and opens fire. 3 members of the group are called and 4 heavily injured, me included. Wake up in hospital and informed that ive been in coma for 3 years. Sosa is now the trap god and is now a king in the rap game. Tell one of the nurses that I recorded a project prior to my accident, give her password and username to access it, die shortly after. 3 song album called the Trinity. Album changes the world, unites everyone under one crying tears of enlightenment. My name, MC HeyZeus.

Kool A.D. and Despot opened, the former was really drunk but put on an okay show, and the latter was funny as fuck and had pretty good energy and I really liked his shit even though I've never really heard of him before. He played most of his new unreleased album, which is 100% produced by Ratatat and all the beats were dirty as fuck. 

After the openers, Killer Mike came on and played a 30-ish minute set consisting of stuff from his solo albums, had us chant Fuck Ronald Reagan a few times, and then played R.A.P. Music. El-P came out to do a solo set after that for about 45 minutes, he did some older stuff and a bunch of newer stuff too like Butane and Tougher Colder Killer.

After that, he brought Mike back out and they did 8 songs off of Run the Jewels. They had so much fucking energy they even got the corny ass hipster crowd that showed up to downtown Minneapolis to jump the fuck around. They closed with A Christmas Fucking Miracle, and they had this giant dude from the crowd come up on stage because he was wearing like the same 36'' chain Mike and El were and they were all like ""Yo, this dude's our bouncer for this last song. He has to sit up here on stage, show no emotion and just nod his head with his arms crossed for the whole song."" was funny as fuck. 

Just felt like typing this shit cause some people enjoy it, feel free to comment nice story bro because that's what I would do. Lemme know if you want me to trow up any pictures I took, all in all one of my favorite rap shows so far just because of how much energy they brought to the show.

I don’t hate anyone not named Kitty Pryde.  Besides I could body that nigga physically, emotionally, spiritually and with the bars so he doesn't threaten me at all.)

Here’s what I see:  on one side you got the seasoned hip-hop heads who find Childish Gambino to be whack as all fuck.  These hip-hop heads have come to the conclusion that Childish is basically a gimmick rapper who stole his flow from Lil Wayne circa No Ceilings (which for the most part is accurate).

On the other side you have a lot of cats who are being introduced to the hip-hop world by Childish Gambino.  He truly is a crossover artist in the strictest definition of the term.  He’s taken large portions of the population who usually do not like hip-hop and got them into it, and I don't see that as being a bad thing.  Maybe some of those CG fans checked out Danny Brown and got into him, or Schoolboy, or some of the more traditional /r/HHH circlejerk fodder. BUT those fans create conflict because the reason they didn’t traditionally like most hip-hop is because they really couldn’t relate to the intrinsically ghetto aesthetic that a lot of hip-hop has, and Childish has pretty much none of that and when he does it’s ironic.  Childish is a lot of white people's hip-hop equivalent to a token black friend; he's black so he gets cool points but he's not one of those threatening thugs so you can bring him home to your parents and your dad won't try and shoot him on sight and you can just be like ""No daddy *he's one of the good ones*.""

To sum it up it’s a battle between old heads and new cats.  The old cats think the new cats are whack, and the new cats think the old cats “don’t get it” and that their new shit is somehow better because CG talks about asian bitches instead of black bitches making him *different* somehow.

At the end of the day, both sides need to kill themselves.  Yea, Childish Gambino is whack as fuck but he got a Tina Fey feature.  Can’t none of you Dom Kennedy 2dopeboyz said-snapbacks-was-whack-6-years-ago-but-they-back-now-so-u-droppin-200-on-ebay-for-a-retro-denver-nuggets-joint dick riders get a Tina Fey feature (yall niggas lucky CG didn't let Tina Fey actually lay down 16 because he knew she would've shitted on everybody and effectively ended the game).  But on the other hand, yall nerdy ass Community fanboys need to chill and respect the Gods before somebody just comes out and bodies the fuck out of CG and ends his career and then yall pseudo deep Tumblr philosopher fans will be forced back to playing old Animal Collective records backwards n shit.

Rock the Bells 2010 in SF

Get there with two buddies. We rolled 5 blunts of medical, and roll with 2 8ths of potent shrooms (one friend didnt want to do it).

We go to the side stage at first, and opening act is Yelawolf. All I know by him is ""party"" featuring Gucci, but he blew me away performing all of Trunk Musik. Immediately became a fan. At one point, he swallowed a fly, and nearly choked to death.

Huge crowd, but luckily I got there early and was in the front. I proceeded to see Jedi Mind Tricks, Murs, Big Sean (Before he was big, but he had a huge following there), Brother Ali, and Immortal Technique. Tech brought out Chino XL, and someone in the crowd threw at bottle at them. Tech looked like he was gonna kill the kid, and told everyone in the crowd to beat the shit out of him. Clipse was also supposed to be there, but was a no show, which I think was because this was around the time when Kanye called Pusha T into going to Hawaii. The finale for the side stage was Wiz Khalifa, who was absolutely insane. This was before he completely blew up, but most of the crowd was there for him. Girls were soaking their panties, and it was amazing. Throughout this side stage experience, I'd say we smoked 3 of our blunts, and met people who smoked us out 2 more joints.

Then we went to the lawn for the main stage. By the time we got there, Lauren Hill had already started. I was very stoked for fu-gee-la and doo-wop, and also was kinda weary of taking these shrooms. Place was packed. Whole lawn was covered, but you could still sit. I sat down, and ate the 8th (which my ""friend"" later confessed to me was 3/16ths).

I saw the designs on my cup begin to change, and realized I was hallucinating. As i sat in bewilderment, I enjoyed the music, which all the girls around were singing along to. There were these 3 huge black guys in front of us (shaq sized), and I thought nothing of it, until they whipped out a COSTCO PIZZA! I ran up to them asking how in the world they got it. of course, they told me they brought it in with them, and looked at me like I was retarted. I sulked back to my seat in the grass. But boy howdy that lauren hill was beautiful. Doo Wop that thing was amazing.

The wait time between sets took foreverrrr. During this time, I was already tripping way too hard. I sat down, and watched the designs on my lemonade move. Music began playing, but I assumed it was simply the speakers, and sat and peoplewatched. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and thus I sat and enjoyed the music.

Then, I recognized a new voice, and the roar of the crowd was deafening. I stood, and saw that I had been missing out on Midnight Marauders by Tribe Called Quest. Not only that, but Busta Rhymes had just come roaring onto the stage! I immediately got crazy into it, and danced like ive never danced before.

As I danced, I noticed people turning to look at me (probably cuz i was heavily drugged). I thought all the hot chicks were looking cuz they wanted on, and proceeded to yell ""EVERY GIRL HERE WANTS TO FUCK ME!!!"" and then continued dancing. Shit was insane.

After Tribe, I sat again. My friends told me we should hit up the bathroom, but I refused, watching the crowd some more. This is when I noticed all the girls talking to guys, and noticed drugs and money exchanging hands. 

This is where shit gets insane. From here on, please remember how fucked up I was

I put two and two together, and decided that every other single person at the concert was also on hard drugs. Not only that, but all the girls there were hookers, who were taking advantage of the drugged out men and trading sex for cash.

My friends kept insisting we go pee. They are so persistent, that i decide that ""pee"" must be code for ""go fuck a hooker"". I refuse, repeating that I have a girlfriend. However, I finally agree to walk them to the bathroom, which I am thoroughly convinced is a brothel.

On the way, we are walking behind two smoking hot chicks our age. They keep looking back flirtaciously, and I am convinced that they want our money for sex. After they look back a fourth time, I yell ""I'M SORRY LADIES, BUT I CANT PEE WITH YOU! I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, AND CAN'T PEE WITH YOU!"" obviously, they leave.

My friends at this point debate leaving, as I am too fucked up and they fear it is permanent. However, we decide Wu Tang and Snoop Dogg is worth the risk. We get to the bathroom, where my friends try to convince me to go in with them to pee. I refuse, as I am proudly faithful to my girl. They go in for what seems like eternity, but was probably 2 minutes. This eternity was too much for me to bear, and I finally give in. I'm going in. I will fuck a hooker. I will ""pee""

What I saw when I walked in blew my mind. It was not rows of beds full of hot chicks. It was dudes. dozens of dudes. All urinating. The shock of the difference between expectations and reality was too much for me. I leave, flabbergasted and confused. My friends are nowhere to be found. I find a female staff worker, and go to her, and ask ""I can't find my friends. How much is this going to cost?"" Before she could recover from confusion and respond, my friends find me and pull me away. We thus head to the 36 chambers.

We get to the lawn, and it is PACKED. Wu tang is starting their first song, which was Shame on a Nigga I believe. I was soooo gone. As we make our way, my hallucination peaks. The next paragraph is what I remember happening. Obviously, it is not what occurred in reality, but what actually happened I will never know.

Ghostface stops the show on the big screen, points me out, and accuses me of saying the N word. I am horrified, as he yells at me, and commands me to drop trow. I do, and my dick has shrunken to a shrivel. The whole crowd points and laughs, including the entire Clan on the jumbotron. They then proceed to call me a racist with a teeny weeny.

Before I know it, I am back at our old spot miraculously. The show is still going, and I went through the 36 chambers. In my mind, they told their tale of slavery to the record industry, and how they must rap about coke and meth when really, they hate it. I go on quite the trip.

Then, they perform C.R.E.A.M., during which i notice Ghostface waving his towel. This is when i notice everyone sitting on blankets. I am confused as to why, until I realize, ""everyone has blankets so they can urinate freely"". Thus, I pee my pants standing during C.R.E.A.M.

End of their set, RZA gives an epic speech. Then , he instructs everyone to make the W, and wave it back and forth. This motion, done by the packed crowd, was such a ridiculous experience. and then.... BOOOOOM! Triumph! My favorite Wu song, as the encore!

I bust a nut in my pants.

literally. i jizz flaccid. and then yell out, proclaiming it to the world...


""I JUST BUSTED A NUT!!!""

then i proceeded to enjoy the best encore ive ever seen. Afterwords, they leave the stage, and I sit back down, and finally come down off the shrooms.

As I sit, I look t my friends, who look exhausted. The people sitting immediately around us had mysteriously left. We awkwardly sit, waiting for snoop dogg. this had been an exhausting experience. I am still unaware of what had truly just happened. 

My buddy tells me we should smoke the last blunt for snoop dogg. I agree, and ask him to get the pack of swishers which has the blunt from my pocket. He touches my pants, and tells me ""dude..its wet..did you pee your pants?""

after a second, i nod. he then asks ""did you...bust a nut?"" I am shocked, and say ""Yes! How did you know!?"". he reminds me that I yelled it out. The blunt was safe, we smoked it during snoop, and drove home after. Shit was insane...

Thank you so much for reading. It was a long write, so I appreciate it.

TL;DR Dont spoil it for yourself, but if you must know, I do shrooms, refuse to pee cuz of hookers, and instead choose to pee and bust a nut during Wu Tang

Many people only know him from his debut album ""*Camp*"" and his most recent mixtape ""*Royalty*"" but I think that some of his older works are really good and might be better than ""*Camp*"" and ""*Royalty*"". Childish Gambino has a pretty broad and dense discography but it will be easy to navigate using this guide. Well here we go, this is the guide to Childish Gambino:

**Before we start with Childish Gambino though, lets talk about mcDJ**: mcDJ was Donald Glover's moniker before he started out as CG. As mcDJ, he mixed songs and made instrumentals many of them actually becoming instrumentals he rapped on later on mixtapes. The releases by mcDJ are not essential to knowing CG but it's cool to know about them if you are a Donald Glover fan. My favorite releases from mcDJ are ""*Fuck Yaselves!*"", ""*Utterances of the Heart*"", and ""*Love Letter in an Unbreakable Bottle*"". Like I said not essential but cool to know about!

OK! Now time for Childish Gambino!:

**Sick Boi**: ""*Sick Boi*"" was Childish Gambino's first release in 2008 (yes CG has been rapping for a while). On this release Donald tries to disguise his voice with a high pitched stuffed nose sounding voice. Don't quote me but I think he tried to do this so people from his college wouldn't be able to tell that it was him rapping. Anyway this is a good release and should be listened to. I know many people are turned off by someone if they have a weird voice but if you can get past it it's worth it.

**Standout tracks from Sick Boi**:

1. [Easy (Intro)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnsif6b_NY4): ""*Sick Bois don't die, they fresh to death*"" That is the starting line for Childish Gambino. This is a really good and chill song. Although it is chill the beat bangs. This is a really good track and one of my favorite CG tracks period (You're gonna see that a lot in this guide).

2. [Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM8XuKNTvAc): A hype Gambino track. Punchlines-a-plenty. Still a very good song though.

3. [Baby Doll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht6snzoqGa0): Another one of my favorite Gambino tracks ever. So chill and nice. Cuddle up to your girl on this one

**Poindexter**: Childish's 2nd release in 2009. Many memorable tracks from this release. A lot of them funny but a lot of them also just good songs. I think this release is also better than Sick Boi too which shows that CG is improving.

**Standout tracks for Poindexter**:

1. [So Much Better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2leMqupES4): ""*Cuz I am so much betteerrr THAN BEFOREEEE*"" Yea he has gotten better punchlines-a-plenty again but once again a great song. The sample (I'm pretty sure it is) is awesome and accents the beat so well.

2. [Phat People](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1o90g31WNU): This features comedian Billy Scafuri. This is one of the funniest songs I have ever heard hands down.

3. [Almost There](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2XsmWghwfM): I want you back Gambino. The sample used in this song is amazing. Play this with a boombox in front of the girl you did wrong house.

4. [Starlight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBKfEKxAWVc): Because DC Pierson is the man and both him and Gambino rip this.

**I AM JUST A RAPPER**: ""*I do not talk, I am just a rapper*"". Probably my favorite Gambino release out of all of them. This was released in 2010 and this is when Gambino really started to pick up some attention. On this release he rapped over various indie songs which alone are good songs too.

**Standout Tracks from I AM JUST A RAPPER**:

1. [Bitch Look at Me Now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOevBmjYaJ4): One of my favorite Gambino tracks. Me and my friends bump this while driving all the time. Over ""*Two Weeks*"" by Grizzly Bear

2. [49ers (Orange Shirt)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQUsYLukEUI): Another DC Pierson feature. Just a great song. Over ""*Orange Shirt*"" by Discovery

3. [I Can Hear Your Feet (Sunrise)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrEN5Hel_wE): ""*Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming Cheeto*"" My favorite Gambino line probably. The song behind this track is amazing too so i'll link it. It's [Sunrise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwUctgGIZJQ) by Yeasayer.

About halfway done now!

**I AM JUST A RAPPER 2**: The same thing as I AM JUST A RAPPER 1, CG rapping over indie tracks. This came out in 2010 as well.

**Standout Tracks from I AM JUST A RAPPER 2**:

1. [Different (Feel It All Around)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwBSTaGkQTY): DC Pierson with the punchlines and CG is rapping from the heart. One of those dear-diary tracks but he still spits. Over ""*Feel It All Around*"" by Washed Out.

2. [The Real (Infinity Guitars)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DCedWXDV4k) A good song but not better than the other Sleigh Bells track he did on I AM JUST A RAPPER 1

**Culdesac**: This is always said to be CG's actual first studio album which was released for free in 2010 right after the I AM JUST A RAPPER series. This is such a great album. So many standout tracks I  believe but i'll try to choose the best.

**Standout Tracks from Culdesac**:

1. [Got This Money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0toKhtewFXE): Again one of my favorite Gambino tracks. He also shows off his singing abilities on here which he hasn't really displayed before.

2. [You Know Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npTqyATr65M): You know a song is hot when he talks about working with Tina Fey. Although I have no clue where this beat originated because almost everyone has spit on this like Iggy Azalea and Kendrick Lamar on ""Look Out For Detox"".

3. [Do Ya Like](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx_vEkVn5Ic): Gambino singing more. This Adele sample is amazing though with this beat.

4. [I'm Alright](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV_jerS6MfM): Gambino talks about how his fame is starting to change him. He wants to be great but it's wearing him down. A dear-diary track that's a little under 2 minutes but still a good song.

5. [The Last](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qVBsWTDtk): I skipped a couple good songs but i didn't want the list to be too long. A raw dear-diary track. He talks about growing up going to different schools and being different from all the other black kids. Just an amazing ending to this album. **Easily the best song on Culdesac**.

You still with me? Almost done, I promise!

**EP**: Released in 2011 after the success of Culdesac although almost a year later. This EP really put Gambino on the map and was the first project by Gambino that I listened to. Only 5 tracks but very very good. 

**Standout Tracks from EP**: All. Literally all of them are worth listening to. It is only 5 track but they are all great. My personal favorites though are Lights Turned On and Not Going Back.

**Camp**: Childish Gambino's debut album on Glassnote Records. From ""EP"" to ""Camp"" there is not much difference in Gambino's style but it is still very good. This was my most anticipated album of 2011 even though ""Take Care"" came out on the same day. Still one of my favorite albums maybe of all time. 

**Standout Tracks from Camp**: 

1. [Outside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXahuQhadV4): First track off of ""Camp"" such a great intro track too. Talks about growing up on this one.

2. [Bonfire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1B_r9nC9k): The lead single to ""Camp"". Gambino just straight spits on this one. Long verse and only one hook. A hype track.

3. [Heartbeat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFVxGRekRSg): Breakup, I want you back, let's fight, let's stop fighting Gambino. A good song. Very different too with the electronic beat. 

4. [L.E.S](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2zrtyqAetw): One of my favorite songs off ""Camp"" and another one of my favorite Gambino songs. L.E.S stands for Lower East Side too just so you all know.

5. [You See Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJFBGpCNvRQ): ""*Asian girls everywhere, UCLA*"" Another hype track and this beat goes hard so does Gambino. Punchlines-A-Plenty.

6. [That Power](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZKAo-DfNxM): Gambino spits about himself for about 3 mins then the best part of the song comes on. Gambino tells a story in first person (which is actually written by DC Pierson) about one of his experiences of going to camp. Very very good.

Now seriously almost finished!

After ""*Camp*"", Gambino teased a new mixtape in about January of last year. Although most of his fans expected it much sooner, he did not release it until July. 

**Royalty**: Released July 4th of last year so it's a year old already. Some people call this release his best ever but that is far from my opinion. This mixtape shows his true ability for rapping. Many people have started to take him serious after listening to this release. Many standout tracks on this project but most of them he is out-rapped by the featured artists. Speaking of featured artists we have ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul on Unnecessary. RZA, Bun B, Danny Brown and many more. And even motherfucking Beck on a feature.

**Standout Tracks from Royalty**: 

1. [We Ain't Them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUAVCBHsTqM): The first track and one of my favorites from this release. Even talks about meeting Questlove and having a conversation about Whitney Houston. Kind of a dear-diary track but by now you should know those are some of the best from Gambino.

2. [One Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fWFAEZ7tXk): This features Steve G. Lover III who is actually Gambino's little brother. They both the brothers rip this one.

3. [American Royalty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXV3vm55iHQ): RZA on this one and yes his feature is amazing. Gambino comes in strong on the second verse too. Not my favorite song on ""Royalty"" but my favorite Gambino verse on it (if that makes sense...)

4. [Toxic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNwpAhfV60E): Danny Brown feature. This song made me fall in love with Danny Brown too. Most you all have probably heard this one anyway. Danny rips it and Gambino brings along the punchlines.

5. [They Don't Like Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sIVFreXEoc): Gambino puts Chance The Rapper on this one. Turns out they are actually good friends too. Nice to see Gambino putting on a up and coming rapper. Chance The Rapper does nicely on this track.

6. [Bronchitis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcCtNwaGDQQ): A track where Gambino is by himself and one of the best from ""Royalty"" he talks about how his success is starting to mess with him. He even has girls tweeting him naked pictures.

7. [Real Estate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJeVCdEVpHc): Standout track because Tina Fey talks shit at the end. That is all. 

Now we've come to the present!

Like I said before Childish Gambino has a very extensive discography that spans a few years. He also has many singles that he has put out. Don't worry I won't list all of them i'll just list my favorites

1. [Twistclip Loop Freestyle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjae316i4kg)

2. [The Longest Text Message](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXXJPW6QDaU)

3. [Eat Your Vegetables](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI50d1xsgTw)

4. [Break (All of the Lights Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veiot_DcdP8) 

5. [Body (feat. Prodigy of Mobb Deep)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=won1xM56dc0)

6. [FDB Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9YqMMSRGGE) 

This took a while but I think you'll be able to breeze through this quickly and pick up on Gambino. Also if you want to find more singles this website [Forever Childish](http://foreverchildish.com/music) is a great place for more. I highly suggest checking out that site. Enjoy!

TMZ has learned.  
  
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... police suspect Kanye committed an attempted robbery when he assaulted a photog at the airport and tried to jack his camera.  
  
The case has now been transferred to the Robbery Homicide Unit and cops are currently putting a file together.  
  
Our sources say the case will be referred to the L.A. County D.A. for possible prosecution.  
  
The victim was taken to the hospital after the attack.  His condition is unknown.  

5:28 PM PT -- The victim wants to press charges against Kanye ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.  What's more, our sources say he's been interviewed by cops and they've determined he did indeed suffer injuries during the attack.  Cops will refer the case to the D.A. as a felony attempted robbery and not a battery case.  The routine is to go after the suspect for the most serious charge.

It doesn't actually work completely at the moment but we're planning on releasing a private beta next week. (press j,k,l, or shift+= to try some of the basic features) It's basically going to be a combination of Turntable and Chat Roulette. 

People will be able to get in a queue to get up and battle rap against eachother in 2 rounds of 1 minute each (30 seconds per rapper per round). Winner stays up and the next person from the queue goes up against them.

Winner is decided by everyone who is spectating the battle. Eventually we're going to add in different rooms for different skill levels/styles/genres and a point based system to determine someones skill so we don't have novices against expert freestyles. We'll also have rooms for written raps and spoken word stuff. 

I'm trying to do a little market research and what I need to know is if this is something you would use? If not, why not? What kind of features could we implement to make this idea better?

In any case, stay tuned for a beta sometime next week.

I feel like this subreddit would really appreciate some type of hiphop remix contest. Or we could take a certain sample and get everybody to flip it, voting for the winner.

I know ALL HHH's love dope beats and would be able to give their two cents on some producers' work time-to-time.

Edit: Well, this thread certainly took off. I posted it and then went out for a while.

It bothers me when any particular rapper or group gets posted over and over in a short time (see: Palmer Squares, or anyone whose birthday it is, or the anniversary of a rapper's death). There's no need to post every individual song from a some mixtape or other new release or ""classic"" tracks. Use common sense and post links in the comments if you feel the need to add to the conversation.

Meaningless clothes, too, because they have no real purpose in life. They don’t keep you warm. What do they do? They just represent to someone else that you’ve achieved something. But then when you look back at it, what have you achieved?

and the icing on da cake

Now, when it's something like Kanye getting GFK on a song, or pretty much anyone popular artist getting 2 Chainz on a song, it makes a little more sense. But when people on the come-up are just putting out mixtapes, how exactly do they get big names on there? And even for the more seasoned rappers, when surprising collaborations emerge, is it just a simple phone call for them?

I'd love some insight to anyone who knows a bit more about the logistics of this, something I've always been a bit curious about but was just too lazy to research/ask.

*Two tips*

1. If you have no interest in participating, please [hide this post](http://i.imgur.com/hgodV.png) rather than downvoting.

2. There are going to be a lot of comments in upcoming threads. To avoid getting lost in off-topic conversations, use the [collapse icon]( http://i.imgur.com/wjYSN.png). It will collapse comments [like so](http://i.imgur.com/EYrK9.png)

*Overview*

We will be having an award ceremony at the end of the year to recognize the greatest/worst/funniest/memorable achievements in hip hop this year.

Thank you to those who have expressed an interest, particularly [Riceburger](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/13f3xd/official_end_of_the_year_lists/).


---

*Purpose of thread*

**In this thread, we are voting on categories for awards**. Feel free to discuss who or what would be eligible for each award, but be aware that this thread is strictly for voting on the categories.

In addition to the six default categories (see below), six additional categories voted on in this thread will be on the official vote. 

----------

*Rules*

1. **Do not suggest a variant of the following categories**. They are in by default:

* Album of the Year
* Song of the Year 
* Verse of the Year
* Mixtape of the Year
* Best New Artist
* Beat of the Year

2. **This is not an award ceremony to recognize redditors or redditor comments**. [Here is my argument for that](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/14kvl0/discussion_biting_in_the_industry/c7e1jyc), if you feel so inclined. 

3. **Do not suggest an award that only one or two rappers are eligible for**. So no ""Best Mike Will Produced Gucci Mane Track Award"", because we all know it would be North Pole. 

4. **Categories can be serious, funny, interesting, whatever**! I think it would be cool if we had a mix, so be creative!

5. Feel free to come up with creative names for the awards, but **please explain the purpose of the proposed award if the meaning is vague**.

**Examples of awards** I thought of: Most Boring Beef, Most Ratchet Movement, Best/Worst Line, Most Embarrassing Moment. If you like one of them, nominate them. If not, fine, be that way.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1355164038.0,,rex,True,t3_14m5ic,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/14m5ic/official_hhh_awards_category_vote/,moderator

A large number of my students really enjoy hip hop -- many of them huge are Chief Keef fans. They also seem to have a preference for the latest chart toppers and a lot of mainstream hip hop. I'd like to be able to embrace their preferred genre and even teach them about its history but I'm at a loss as to where to begin my research. I've listened to Atmosphere, Aesop Rock, Sage Francis, Common, and others but never truly in a dedicated manner. I think it would be neat to be able to say to my hip hop-minded students ""oh, you like this guy? You should check this person then, they have a similar flow"" or whatever and to be able to say that with authority. I can do that when it comes to other genres but my goal is to able to do that with hip hop.

My question, hiphopheads, is what resources, books, documentaries, newspaper clippings, albums, blogs, etc. might you suggest to someone who knows little of the genre but wants to develop a healthy knowledge of hip hop's history (especially as it pertains to Chicago), major players throughout the years, and basic elements of performance? Additionally, if you were a middle or high school student what kinds of things would you have hoped to have learned about hip hop or, similarly, what kinds of things do you think all students **should** know about hip hop?

I have a strong background in Western European music history, rock history, jazz history, but when it comes to hip hop I'd like to more so that I can become a more well-rounded music teacher. 

Thanks for your time.

**EDIT:** Thanks all, keep the suggestions coming. Looks like I have a metric fucktonne of reading to do. Thank goodness I'm on summer break!

**EDIT:** I've got my netflix queued up for tomorrow and have about good dozen or so books to read. Thanks for suggestions and thanks for such a welcoming atmosphere!

**EDIT:** As to the concern about vulgarity and lyrical appropriateness -- I generally feel safe bleeping out a word or two and have no problem doing the bleeping myself. What I cannot work around are songs that are at length explicit in a vulgar, sexual, or violent nature or music that directly makes references to drugs in a positive light. I've had my ass in a sling before for simply wearing earrings to work so I walk cautiously... until I'm tenured. So general response -- a ""fuck"" or two in a song is easier to deal with then a lengthy lyrical passage about spousal abuse or smokin' kush.",,False,,t5_2rh4c,1374120491.0,,,True,t3_1ihuu2,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1ihuu2/question_from_a_music_teacher/,

You know what the other cool thing is about mixtapes.

Second one he's done (well third I think but one got downvoted a lot).

Quick title, but he's also manager of Frank Ocean and Trash Talk so be sure to ask questions regarding that too.

Edit: Sorry for the accidental misleading title, only Christian Clancy is doing the AMA. Meant the title to mean he's the manager of OF and other artists, not the manager of OF is doing an AMA along with other artists.
