I've been holding this in for nearly 15 years, but I feel I should get this out there. I apologize if some of this doesn't make sense, or if it seems out of order, It's difficult for me to draw these memories up.

I come from a poor family, both parents constantly working and never home. I was young, and my sister and I couldn't take care of ourselves. I was 6 and my sister 7, and we'd be forced to go to my aunt's house to be babysat; not always by my aunt. It began when I was 5, and we were visiting my aunt but she had left for work and were left in the hands of my alcoholic uncle.
 It started with verbal abuse, saying we were a plague on his household, we were horrible kids and every nasty thing you could say to a 5 year old. He was a drunk, I understood why he was always yelling. It started escalating from yelling across the room to in our faces. By the time I turned 6, He was in our faces every time we were left in his care. It took a turn for the physical when he started throwing things at us. After months of screaming, throwing shoes, clothes, toys and different household objects at us, he finally started to take a turn for hitting us with his hand. I knew he would go after my sister, because she was the girl. Every time I heard him scream, I would lock my sister in a closet and tell her to stay until I came and got her. For about 10 months I was subjected to beatings, being burnt with cigarettes up and down my legs, arms, and back; Subjected to being thrown around, and assaulted verbally and physically. Throughout the times I was being assaulted I would lock my sister away, hiding her from him, choosing to keep him distracted with me instead of her. Half the time I would convince her that we were playing a game, and her memories were only of her hiding from a screaming deranged drunk. She never knew what was actually going on. After I turned 7, I had learned how to patch up any wounds I received while being beaten. Spending time reading books and watching instructional videos on first aid and self defense. Teaching myself how to block some of the more powerful hits to stave off more serious injury. 

It continued on up until the following spring. 

That spring, after my cousin's birthday party, my parents started getting ready to go. two of my younger cousins wanted to go spend the night with my brothers at our house, which my parents agreed to. My mom said I would stay at my aunt's until morning when she could come and get me, because there was no more room in the car. After crying and protesting the idea, she still left, and my sister and I left in the hands of my aunt (who was dead asleep in her room) and my overly intoxicated uncle. 
When the party ended and I was in the family room awake, trying to fight off sleep so I could keep watch and stay away from my uncle. Having to use the bathroom, I left the family room to find my uncle standing in the hallway. He was more intoxicated than usual. He could barely walk, stumbling just to stand. He followed me and grabbed me by my arms, throwing me on the floor. after about a minute of him pinning me down, slapping me calling me a waste of space, Putting out is cigarette on my already scarred legs, he got up pushed me aside and started stumbling towards the family room where my sister was sleeping. 
I knew he wanted to go after her. I spent nearly a year hiding her away and protecting her from him, choosing to be beaten over watching him beat and possibly assault my sister sexually. I wasn't going to sit idly by while he attacked her, so I jumped up and started pushing him. Yelling at him to stop and even insulting him to distract him from her. After getting his attention he came back after me, chasing me down and punching me with a closed fist. Something he didn't do before. 
I managed to get away from him and ran downstairs.. Enraged he tried following me, and he fell down the stairs. Knocked unconscious he laid there perfectly still, I ran up and kicked him a few times to make sure he was out. 

I stayed up the rest of the night, expecting him to come through the door of the family room, but he didn't. The next morning, My mother came to pick us up, we left and I never said a word. The following night, he was arrested for drunk driving after crashing his truck into a pole. My sister told my mom of the screaming, and she told us she'd wouldn't leave us there anymore. He was in prison for 3 years, and when he came back out, I was already 11, and was able to care for myself, my sister and my 2 brothers. I never saw him again, nor did I ever tell my mom or my sister about my scars, both emotional and physical. Even to this day my sister only remembers the screaming, and I don't have the heart to tell her about my beatings. 

Now, I have decided to get help. throughout my life I thought the dreams, flashbacks and fear of being hurt was normal, and I learned to live with it until I confided in my bestfriend of 7 years who is now currently my girlfriend,Who told me that my paranoia, my fear of people and fear of pain isn't normal. 

I am now looking for help, dealing with my fears, paranoia and what my physician categorized as PTSD. But I felt the first step, was to write all of this out, and put it out there for the world to see. I didn't do this for Karma, points or whatever, this post was for me. And now, as hard as this was to write out, I'm going to find a therapist, deal with my fears and soon enough, when i'm comfortable enough in thinking I have dealt with these issues and problems, I will ask my girlfriend to marry me. I don't know how long it'll take or how tough it will be to face these things after over 10 years of pushing it away, but I know I have to do this. 


I can do this.

At first I would struggle and fight it, she outweighed me by 75lbs and was strong as fuck too. But she seemed to enjoy the struggle, so after a while I would just lay there and let her finish. I feel so empty and angry, I no longer trust women. 

We have been divorced now for 3 years. I am alone and have no desire to date at all. I've had sex maybe 3 times since and really had a rough time dealing with it. 

I hate how one sick women has changed me to the core to where I live like a hermit. I won't ever allow anyone in my home, I go out with friends occasionally, anymore I prefer the safety of my home. I used to be very social and outgoing. Now it takes every bit of effort and a couple of drinks before I go out and I prefer to only be with the guys. 

I feel like a broken person who will end up dying alone.

I wouldn't get married. I wouldn't buy a house. I wouldn't have kids.

Why did I sign up for this? It's the greatest lie ever told. I work 1.5 jobs to keep my family just barely afloat, my house is a money pit, my kids are very young and very needy, my wife is stressed out by having to deal with the needy kids all day, and I dread going home after work because all I get to do is take care of the kids until they go to sleep. And with one of them being a pain in the ass 5 month old, I'm lucky if I can get to bed by midnight. 

Between 8am and midnight there is always a child awake. They rarely nap, but they do sleep through the night. So I'm granted 6-7 hours of continuous sleep, but the trade-off is that I don't get five minutes of free time to myself other than my shitty commute.

I got married because I love my wife and wanted to spend my life with her. That's not what I got. I now get 1% of her attention while the kids take 99% of it. When my wife does talk to me, 75% of what she says is about how the kids ruined her body or she doesn't poop right or she's bloated for no reason. Old people have nothing to talk about but their health problems. We're not old. What the fuck.

People see me my family and tell me how lucky we are. And how much they miss those days of having little kids. Are you fucking kidding me? Does it actually get worse from here?

I have a deep passion for movies. Haven't been to a movie theater in 2.5 years. I have a netflix account. I watch less than 2 movies per month, and never get to do so in one sitting.

I used to read books. Gone. The only moment I can possibly read is just after the baby goes to sleep (and then only for a few minutes as I'm dead fucking tired) but my wife says it's the only time of day we get to talk to each other, and asks me not to read. 

I want my fucking life back. That's all. I want to read a book, or watch a movie, or go play basketball.

To young guys reading this...don't get married. There is almost no benefit aside from minor tax advantages. Marriage is just a legal yoke around your neck to extract ruinous financial penalties from you if things don't work out. The risk is all yours, and you get little to no benefit.

I've known you for around 5 years. My girlfriend at the time H was a mutual friend of yours and your friends.  This is how our friendship began.  We had very similar interests, reddit, video games, and a bunch of other stuff. H and I dated for around a year of that time.  We became very close friends.  After I broke up with her, I texted you and told you I was sorry for what had happened and what was about to happen.   You responded with, ""Gotta do what you gotta do.""  I didn't hear from you for quite a while, almost a year after that.  You added me back as a friend on facebook.  We began hanging out again, like nothing had happened.  Drinking playing video games all night.  Talking about philosophy, and what there could or could not be in this world.  

One night when we were drinking at your parents house, we decided to get in their hot tub and drink to our hearts content.  We ended up talking about sex and the joys of it.  I said something along the lines that I was horny, and you responded by turning around and pulling your pants down and saying fuck me.  I was taking back by this, however, not opposed to it.  We fucked in the hot tube and then your parents bath tub and then in your bed.  

I thought the next morning was going to be weird, however it wasn't.  We didn't talk about it right then, but you text me when I was about half way home, telling me that you had fun and that we should try it sometime with less alcohol.  I agreed.  We have fucked many times since then.  However, our hanging out is so sporadic.  Due to many reasons I'm sure.  This whole venture that we have been on has been exciting and strange, but I fervently enjoy it. The last time that we did anything together was not that long ago, but for the first time we did something different.  You gave me this look dead in my eyes, and the next thing I know your tongue is down my throat.  We've never kissed before, it's about the only thing we haven't done.  It was amazing, and after you left it made my heart race.  I was very confused from the whole situation, it made my distort and my head race.  I haven't seen you or talked to you since then, however, this is normal for us.  Both being introverts and all.  

**Well here is my confession reddit and Sm: I love you, and I want to be with you.  I want you to be mine, and me yours.** 

I leave with this: I'll leave this up for a couple of days, and if you haven't sent me anything by then, I'll pm it to you.  At which point either our friendship will end, because you probably won't be able to face me if you don't feel the same way, or, we could talk more about it and go from there.

I feel I'd be happier if I had been born in perhaps Africa, Siberia- somewhere that's not so vapidly fucking shallow. 

But being honest with myself, I don't think I'd be able to stomach such a huge and abrupt culture change. That's why I desire the housewife lifestyle- all the creature comforts and none of the 9-to-5 grind. I know I'd be a good housewife, too. In some small ways, I resent the feminist movement for eradicating this sort of lifestyle, and even making it a tad shameful in society. I'm in school, but it's only so I have a solid, forward-moving excuse not to work- I'm ""husband-hunting"" everywhere I go!

We were in the same class for all of this time.


It started out OK, we were friendly at times in primary school, although he would have went through periods of bullying me.  In secondary school it was pretty bad.  He would have bullied me a lot by hitting me, calling me a faggot, pushing me around and stuff like that.  He made my life an absolute misery and, by 5th year in secondary school, had turned everyone in the class against me.  


He was one of the ""cool crowd"" who used to smoke and allegedly drink every week end.  I remember I tried smoking, foolishly to try and fit in, and got made fun of because of my pathetic attempts at inhaling. 


I remember I used to lie in bed at night and cry over what this guy was doing to me.  Of course, I never went to anyone to tell them what was happening and I never told my parents and still, to this day, haven't told them what happened.  



Some things stand out more than others when the bullying occurred, even 16 years after leaving school I think about them from time to time.  There was one time when he was ramming a chair into my legs and kept saying ""sit down!"" and the whole class was laughing about this.  



I'm a regular member on a local music forum and this guy's brother also posts on it too.  I didn't actually know it was his brother until he announced the death of his brother - the school bully who I hated so much.  Apparently this guy had died from an undiagnosed heart problem in his sleep.  


Part of me feels bad that he's dead but another part of me is happy he's away.  He really did make me completely miserable and I used to  wish I could go back and have a different attitude and stand up for myself.

When I was raging with hormones I guess I started loving them a little more.


I fooled around but never fucked an animal until today. 
One experience I will never forget was driving through a safari park and feeding a huge elk, I had no food left in the car but he stuck his head in. I was struck by how gorgeous he was, He licked my face and nuzzled me, I leaned my head against him and stroked his warm fur. 
I made out with an elk. Fuck yeah. 

ANYWAYS OFF TOPIC BACK TO THE SUBJECT.

I met someone on a zoo site and we talked for a bit, exchanged [clothed] pics and pics of his dog. Texted a bit and met at a mall today.

I was just thinking, YOLO right? 
I knew it would forever itch at me if I didn't just cross that one experience off the list. 

It was very brief and awkward, when we went to his apartment his dog started eating me out. Deep licks for a good 20 minutes. It felt really good. I then went into position and after a while he thrust in me. It felt amazing for around 5 seconds then extremely painful.
 
The whole thing lasted 30 seconds. I got knotted and it ended up ripping my vagina from stretching it out so much. We stayed tied but I had to take a shower, there was so much blood. It hurts to walk, it hurts to pee. Dog sex is extremely painful and shitty.

I can only take 6 + 1/2"". 

This lab had a 9 incher and a knot the size of a softball that ripped my organs apart. 

I stopped bleeding, I was too scared to go to the hospital.

I have had gay friends.

I understand that for gays and non-gay supporters of gay marriage this issue is seen in a similar light as the civil rights movement for African Americans in the 1960s.

I don't care for bigots, so if you are tempted to disrespect people because of their sexual orientation please know that I do not endorse that nor am I one of ""you"".

Rationally, your mind can be going in one direction while your emotions are going in another direction.

On an emotional level, I am tired of hearing about gay marriage.

The government seems incapable of doing basic budgetary duties to keep the country running and it may hurt the already sucky economy further.   There is a huge amount of unemployment and threats to existing jobs.   Americans are earning less and less.   Global climate change is serious and nothing as serious as that problem deserves is being done about it.   Right wingers are rolling back reproductive freedom at a fast clip without any serious opposition.

Yet, plenty of news segments, news articles and facebook posts about gay marriage activism.

Yipee.

I am *worried* about some big things and nobody is talking about them as much as they are talking about gay marriage.

Everyday I am worried about the economy and my job.  No group is standing up for me.   The activists I see coming out of the gay marriage office near my tea shop live in an elite area where most people earn 6 figure salaries.

I have a lot of women friends on and off facebook.  They all go on about gay marriage endlessly.

I know it is a worth issue, but on an emotional level it has nothing to do with me, my life or my concerns.  On an emotional level it feels like a triviality that people are going on and on about while ignoring serious problems.

Ugly spleen venting done.

No disrespect to any gay or queer people.  Keep looking out for yourself and I hope gay marriage becomes legal all over the country.

I wasn't planning on getting with Linda ever and it really did just happen. With Chris away at college one weekend, Linda needed some help getting some big boxes moved to a storage room.

She laughs, says sorry, and goes about looking through Chris's closet for what she was looking for. And as she left the room she takes one quick look at my package. That got me really horny and made me think I had an opportunity to fuck her. After lunch, I decide to take my chance and see if she wants what I want.

I never told anyone and I didn't try to resist, even though I knew it was sick and wrong.

The worst part, though, is that when I was almost 13, my grandpa found out. My brother had made me do something for him one day and my grandpa either overheard or saw or something, I still don't know. However, instead of trying to help me by making my brother stop, my grandpa blackmailed me by saying he would tell my parents that ""he knew what I was doing"" unless I told him everything. He also insinuated that the would have liked me to do the same for him, but I didn't. To this day, though, my grandpa still looks at and touches me inappropriately, but I've never told anyone (about my grandpa or my brother) except my boyfriend and my best friend because I don't want to tear my family apart.

I'm usually the one getting dumped.  I've cried, begged, coerced, and held men emotionally hostage just so I wouldn't feel the sting of rejection.  I've sacrificed my own truth, dignity, and well being just to be in a relationship even though the person may not share ANY of my belief, values, or goals.  I have basically taken any scraps that a man might throw my way.

Why?  Because my self esteem has been in the toilet my entire life.  I am a strong, independent leader in most every situation that I find myself in except with men...

And on Sunday morning, laying in bed with a man I barely know, I finally had enough.  He wanted to just ""keep it casual"" and refused me when I asked him out on a date.  He insisted that I don't tell anyone about our time together, not even my girlfriends.  And in an instant, I had the courage to say what I have been longing to believe my whole life; ""That's not going to work for me.

She and I started sleeping together. Then at the end of last semester, my cousin bought a house here and offered to let me stay there for free. I told her that I was grateful for everything, but that I'd be moving out.

She offered to let me stay there for free. I think it's probably because she wants to get laid.

My mum was distraught, and left with 3 children and no family to back her up she went into huge depression. I picked up the pieces by looking after my 3 month old sister (Sophia) and my 9 year old sister as well, my mum stopped eating and at one point didn't get out of bed for a week, but no one ever knew as she begged me not to tell and my sisters were kept well by myself. 

Once my mum got over depression the anger started, she first banned us from seeing our dad, then made us tell the social lady we didn't ever want to see him again (I knew my dad hurt my mum, but I of coursed still loved him and wanted to see him). Then my mum started to regret her life choices and wanted to be a teenager again, she stopped taking care of Sophia to such an extent that my sister would call me mum. All the time my mum would use me as a sounding board for her problems, she would be lonely and I would try and make her feel better by sleeping in the bed with her and doing all the housework and secretly sneaking her my savings from my money box so she wouldn't worry so much about money.
This went on for about a year.

Then the boyfriends started...

She had two, one was rich and pervy and one was Joe.

Joe was her old boss, he made her feel young. She married him, he beat her, she confessed this to me every time it happened.

She got pregnant, and my third sister was born. but this baby wasn't my dads, but Joe's, so it was spoilt by Joe and my mum. They forgot Sophia existed, and Sophia appeared to accept it, she had never really had my mum as a mother and had me instead. I saw it was wrong so I spoke up to Joe, to my mum, to everyone. 

My mum didn't like that, especially as I started  to ask about seeing my dad. So she moved us to the other side of the country. Cut us off from our extended family. She changed our names and made us disappear.

So, being so far away, joe and my mums marriage got worse. So I would listen to her tell me how much she hated him and wanted to leave him, however it was never his fault he was a drunk, it was apparently mine, I apparently ruined their marriage by questioning their actions as parents. So, being cut off from anyone, she started to take her slowly dying life out on me, hitting me, emotionally blackmailing me and cornering me so that I felt I could do nothing.

I would fantasize about leaving, running away, committing suicide, anything to get me away.  I felt like i could do nothing to help her and anything I would do would get me punished. I went into depression and became anorexic, maintaining 6st for over 3 years of my teenage years.

But I was saved... and got a boyfriend. My mum and Joe are extreme catholics so when Joe and my mum found out about my bf Joe threw me out of the house as he wasn't catholic or pre-approved. I went to live with my boyfriend and through him I re-met my dad and my extended family. I beat anorexia and never felt like committing suicide again.

I was saved, but I had left them, I had left Sophia who called me mum, who I looked after when she was sick, who I taught to count, to read, to dress herself, to walk, to talk and to use the potty. I left her... and I feel so bad about it.

But I haven't ever told anyone how bad it was, because I couldn't bear the idea of my sisters being broken up, instead I save everything and work hard so that one day I can save them and look after them once again.

My mum and Joe were the cause of my anorexia, the reason I bit my nails, the reason I got black eyes, the reason I can't sleep, the reason I pick my feet until they bleed because there is still a part of me that feels guilty and knows I deserve to suffer as they are still suffering and I left them...

I got my Monday to Friday job just to pay the bills.
I got my a tiny little 3 1/2 appartment where I lock myself in when I want to be alone.
I got my friends and my family to turn to when I feel like being sociable mainly on weekends.

I want to dedicate myself to being the picture of health. I just want to be that guy that everyone likes. That guy that doesn't have the weight of a mortgage, an annoying, nagging wife, a crying baby, utility bills, city taxes, school taxes, car payments, oil changes, tune-ups etc. 

I want to be that guy that just has to worry about making his rent on time, keeping his fridge full, and clothes on his back.

I don't really know why I did it or what I was expecting to read.. I definately regret it now.

I saw her emails from and sent to some other guy. They talked about how much they missed each other, how ""sexy"" my mom was, etc. My mother referred to her husband/my dad as the ""dick"" and she said things like, ""don't text me on Friday because my daughters will be playing on my phone during the car ride."" She also said, ""Hey can we hang out another day instead? two coworkers were caught cheating on their spouses this past week and I don't want to add to the trend."" 

I'm really upset right now and I don't know what to do. I feel like everything my mom has ever done is a lie now. I have a great relationship with both of my parents. I can talk about anything with my mom and she's really supportive. Cheating really doesn't seem like something she would do.

My parents are complete opposites. My mom is really social and loves going out with friends while my dad is pretty quiet. His only real best friend is his brother and they are inseparable. He generally likes staying home, being with my mom, or going places with my uncle. He'll buy anything for my mom and do anything for her.. but I feel like my mom wouldn't do the same. Other than that, they seemed to have a great marriage. I've only seen them argue once in my whole life and I'm 16. I always admired their love for each other and how lucky I was to have parents like that. I'm mad at my mom for ruining that.

I have a 12 year old sister and 21 year old brother.

I was arrested in Oct. 2011 with a felony warrant for something I never did. I have severe borderline personality disorder. I am a cutter. My mom and I had been arguing and she is notorious for saying very hurtful things. I didn't know at the time that she had something very wrong in her mind. It all started over a fucking cheeseburger. My sister went to grab some dinner and I asked her to get me something while she was there. I asked her, gave her the money, and thanked her all right in front of my mom. My sister returned with my food and out of no where my mom went into a rage. She acted as if we kept getting dinner a secret from her. She took off in a rage and bought something for herself. When she returned, I was just eating and surfing the net. She began saying things. ""You should have died instead of your brother. You need to go cut yourself deeper, you can't even do that right."" She had just beat the shit out of me a month before and I could feel it coming. She (was) a large lady and I was 100 lbs. She choked me til I nearly went unconscious. I managed to pull her by the hair to get her off. I never wanted to hit my mom.

 I yelled back to her ""fine, have it your way."" I went to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife I could find. She sat down and laughed. I grabbed the knife and slit my wrist. The night before I had cut my thighs because of something she said the previous day. (Thighs because I don't want people to know I cut) I was a mess. I cut myself and ran outside. I actually didn't even get a good cut in, but there was blood. Long story short, police came. I was sitting in my cedar tree outside where I relax. A cop found me, and seemed to care. I asked him to get me help. I asked him to shoot me if he didn't. I didn't want to live. I was obviously sent to the stress unit at the hospital. I was covered in bruises and cuts from both her and myself. I told the doctors and staff what happened. I felt relief after nearly 2 weeks there. Of course, I had to go back home. 

Literally the day after I get out of the hospital the police came back. I was next door (where my sister lives.) They asked for me and I came outside thinking ""wtf now."" I will never forget that son of a bitch cop who wouldn't tell me why he was there. Another cop car came and they told me to put my hands behind my back. I instantly started crying and freaking out. 

""Why??!?? What did I do?"" I wasn't even told my charges until they were driving me to jail. The cop said some smart ass remark about people who hurt their own mothers. He told me I was being arrested on a felony warrant of criminal recklessness. I tried to tell the cop that I had no idea what he meant. He finally muttered that my mother told them I stabbed her. WHAT THE HELL?

I was assaulted by a female cop when I went in. She did my strip down and cough and squat. She was training another female cop and when she got to my breasts, the BITCH SQUEEZED MY NIPPLES. I will never forget that.

They threw me in the cell for sick people because I was still considered  very ill.I was cut off of my meds, I sat there for 5 days rocking and crying. I kept telling anyone who would listen that I didn't do anything. They sat my bail at $15,000 no 10%. No one had the money to get me out. I didn't tell them I was suicidal because I was threatened with a ""green bean suit."" I wanted to die so bad. When I finally got to talk to my mother, I asked her why she did it. Why she lied. She acted like she wasn't lying and making it all up on the spot. I finally got to go to court. I never had the chance to speak other than entering my plea. I was appointed a piece of shit public defender. They let me out under the conditions that I don't live with my mother anymore, and that I continue seeking mental health care. 

I lived with a family friend after that. I got a thick envelope full of ""evidence"" against me. The knife I had used to cut with was laying on the floor where I left it. My mother had a small scratch (probably from me trying to get her off of me.) She called that her ""stab wound."" It was located on her forearm. She had me.  She never went to the hospital or even a doctor for that matter. The cop that believed her must have really been a fool. 

Fast forward a year later. My mother was diagnosed with a long list of mental illnesses and has accused 3 other people of hurting her since. She had to be moved to a nursing home because her brain no longer functions like it should. She is with it sometimes, other times she still thinks I am 3. Kind of like dementia I guess. 

I just went to court in August. I moved 200+ miles away and had to have my sister help me get my proof that my mom just lost it. We had papers from her doctors and my own doctors that state the obvious. My mother and I both have problems, but there's no way I'd ever stab her. Anyone for that matter. 

I am so angry. I lost everything I owned due to my arrest, the cops wouldn't let me back in to get my belongings. Even my pets. My public defender presented the prosecutor with my side of the story. I had witnesses that the cops never interviewed. I had doctors papers stating that my mother was not with it. The only thing that did was reduce my charges from a felony to misdemeanor. I just took the damn charges. I was mentally done with it. Everyone told me I should have fought it. I just didn't have it in me. I was only sentenced to 1 year probation and still to see a doctor. Everyone that knows me personally knows that I didn't and wouldn't do it. 

I had my life torn apart by this. Just the *thought* of me stabbing my own mom makes me sad. I lost everything, my cats, my clothes, my bed and every single picture I had. I hate the police now, the system. Anyone can say you did something and the cops will believe them. I am already torn down by depression and anxiety, the PTSD has sat in and I am fucking tired of this mess. I feel really, really bad for anyone sitting behind bars for a crime that they didn't commit. Be aware, you could piss the wrong person off.

I was 27 and sick of waiting.

I had spent months doing the research: reading reviews, looking at the protocol (""Where do I put the money?"", etc.). One day when my parents were out, I made a call. I asked for ""Stephanie,"" she said it was her, and I asked if she was busy a couple hours later. She wasn't and told me to call when I got near her apartment - she gave me an intersection but not an address. (I knew the price and whatever you're thinking it is, it was less.)

Long story short, it was... pleasant. I was 27 and had never been naked with a woman before, nor had I ever fooled around (even foreplay). I'll admit simply getting over this hurdle was worth it but I didn't perform very well (anxiety!). We finished in 30 minutes and spent the next 30 minutes just chatting.

This morning's been particularly bad, and this might be a lot of hyperbole. There are some good moments, but we all have people in our lives that we dislike. It really, really sucks when one of those people is your son.

A confession is an admission of something YOU did/didn't do that you feel shitty about. I find a good rule of thumb is considering your confession, and asking yourself if it is something you'd tell a priest (if you were Catholic) in a confessional. Would you have to atone for it? Then it goes here. Otherwise, consider [r/offmychest](www.reddit.com/r/offmychest) for all your venting needs.

It wasn't that great but we exchanged information and I called her later that week.  I met up at her place and we drank and fucked.  She was fucking wild and open to anything.

I'm in my mid twenties and have fucked a range of college girls to soccer moms.  This woman is the best I've ever had.  Any passing fancy I've had, I can pull on her.  From gentle to rough.  I don't do it too often but I love it when she slams heroin and I can fuck her.  Her drug induced pleasure convulsions are amazing.  Often times after I come, I pull out and just stagger around as she writhes on the couch... and I laugh at how fucking wrong this is.  Sometimes she goes into an almost comatose state for a while and I just use her body like a sex toy.

I love it.  I'm sure I'm going to catch something from her but I can't stop.  Thankfully I'm not in a relationship right now but I know it's most likely jeopardizing my future relationships.

I was in a time of real loneliness and neediness. I've never had very good self esteem, so I was never all that good at talking to girls. I really wanted to have a girlfriend. I've had several girlfriends, but none of them were exactly what I wanted. I had fantasies of experiencing things like going to a 4th of July party with a girlfriend, or going on a road trip with a girlfriend etc. I was imagining the same girl in all the fantasies. Eventually I started fantasizing about sex with her, and kissing her, and cuddling with her. I loved it. Before too long, this was all I thought about. Every night when trying to fall asleep, I would imagine her cuddling with me. If I had to go somewhere, I imagined going there with her. I was never alone, I always imagined that she, this fictional, fabricated coping mechanism, was always with me. 

Now, I didn't think this was a bad thing, I knew it was pretty pathetic, but I just thought that once I found a real girl I really liked, I wouldn't need the fantasies anymore. Well, one night I was watching a horror movie, and there was a scene where a guy's wife gets murdered in front of him. For some reason, I imagined myself and the fantasy girl in that situation. If I saw her get murdered in front of me. I almost cried. What I realized shortly after was something that would affect the rest of my life. I had actual feelings for an imaginary woman. 


Well, the fantasies continued. By this point I've created false memories with her. I fantasize about the rest of my life with her. An idealized life with an idealized woman. Things like what happened during the horror movie were normal now. Every time I hear some sad story about a couple, I imagine the fantasy girl and myself as the couple. I realized now that I had fallen in love with this made up woman. 

Over the next year or so, I had a couple girlfriends, lost my virginity, and even had experiences with real girls like the ones I wanted. However, the bad thing was that I had set the fantasy girl as my standard. The main problem with all my girlfriends was that they were't the fantasy girl. I was disappointed by losing my virginity because it wasn't lost to the fantasy girl. I knew this was bad, and I tried to get rid of her by ignoring the thoughts completely. Distracting myself from thinking about her long enough for her to fade back into being just another product of my imagination. But I found that I got upset and lonely when I did this. I needed her to not feel depressed and lonely all the time, and I needed her gone to be able to have a normal relationship with a girl. It was a lose-lose situation.

I just noticed how much I've typed, so I'll wrap this up.

After a lot of mental discipline, I've managed to weaken her presence in my life. She's still a coping mechanism in a way. For instance if I try to flirt with a girl and it doesn't go very well, then later on I'll imagine that it was the fantasy girl I was talking to, and she flirts back and everything works out. Or if I'm feeling depressed and worthless, I might lay down for a while, and imagine the fantasy girl cuddling with me and trying to make me feel better. I don't know if I'm gonna go on to get happily married and have kids, or if I'm gonna end up homeless and ruined. But what I know is that she'll be around in my head for the rest of my life regardless.

Currently I’m a university student, I have a boyfriend of 2 years and I have a job 3 days a week in which I tutor a 14-year-old boy for school (We’ll call him Charlie).

I’ve been working with Charlie for about a year and a half, sometimes we have the lessons at his house or mine, depending on the circumstances. His home life is… cold, his parents are the typical kind of rich people who clearly didn’t want/shouldn’t have had children. This is such a shame because he is really sweet, he’s not immature yet not older beyond his years, and he just comes across as a nice, sweet, innocent kid.

I didn’t notice it until it was pointed out to me by my boyfriend and my housemates that Charlie fancies me. It didn’t bother me at first because it seemed easy enough to handle, I would just ignore it, and it would go away after a while. My little brother used to do this with a lot of my friends; it rarely lasted longer than 3-4 weeks.

The problem is that over time I’ve noticed I like Charlie too.

At first I thought it was maternal, his parents don’t give a shit about him and I felt sorry for him, I’d take him home with me if I could.

But now I can’t stop thinking about him, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, and everyday my boyfriend seems less and less appealing. The best relationship of my life is deteriorating because I’m falling for a child… 7 years younger than me.

It makes me feel sick, it’s so wrong, but I can’t stop thinking about him. The only resolution to the situation that I can see is if I were to quit. But I feel that I’d be leaving this poor, lonely kid with his distant parents. It worries me that he’s not getting the kind of social environment children that age deserve. Also, I really need the money.

Charlie’s in no danger from me, I may be in a confusing situation but I'm not stupid. I don’t even know how he’d react to that… I know he likes me, but I doubt he knows I like him too.

I was a juror who convicted a man that was sentenced to prison... for life.  I am almost certain that man was not guilty.

I don't know if there was some type of fix or if some people are that dumb.  No matter how much I tried to poke holes in the validity of their arguments using evidence we could count on they wouldn't budge.  Slowly those who supported me dropped out.  I eventually just got tired.  We already spent so much time hearing the story from both sides.  At that point I just wanted to resume my normal life.  I just got tired and wussed out.

I don't think I did anything to be put in this position and now I feel it all coming down on me because I couldn't do what's right.

I only caved because I thought the arguments and evidence were so ridiculous that the defendant would surely get an appeal and a new trial.  But I heard that's not so easy.

Given the nature of where I work, and my unwillingness to give up my actual identity, this will be tough to prove, but I can't let reddit go without hearing my story.

I work for a small technical team in a closed-door office inside of a top secret cleared building. After being on this team for around 6 months, a new girl joined our project (different team) and she and I hit it off right away. She is gorgeous, very sexual, intelligent, and all-around out of my league, but was actually into me. Things started with us going out to lunch together, and from there progressed into whoever was the passenger at the time would tease the driver by putting their hands high up on their legs or kissing and biting their neck. It didn't take long after for this to continue into the office where we would spend all of our alone time in my team's area making out and feeling each other up.

We wound up having sex at my house before work one morning, but never thought our office antics would go any further than they did. We both joked around about how amazing of a story having sex inside one of these cleared areas would be, but it didn't seem like this would ever happen. This changed one day when one of our lunch breaks turned way more sexual than normal, and we nearly wound up having sex in the parking lot. The only reason we didn't is because we had already been gone for a long time and I was concerned about the possibility of someone driving up to us and seeing what we were doing. Afterward I spent the next 6 or so hours unable to think about a single other thing other than having sex with her.

At the end of the day we were walking around checking to see who was around and getting ready to head out when we realized we were the last two people there. I had closing privileges at this building so as we walked into one of the conference rooms to turn the lights off, we started making out immediately. I pushed her up against a wall and unbuttoned her jeans wanting nothing more than to be inside of her right that very second. She stopped kissing me and walked over toward the lights to turn them off, and as she did I asked her ""Are we really going to do this?"" and she responded ""It's too late not to now. We are definitely fucking in here.""

She laid down on the floor, took her jeans off, and we had sex right there. After wanting her so badly for the entire day, I think I might have made it all of 2 minutes before my time was done, and I tried to pull out before I came inside of her, and was only barely successful as I managed to instead do so all over the floor and inside of my pants instead. Not my proudest moment, but words don't describe just how incredible those couple of minutes were.

After that we continued to have sex a few times, but always in far less risky places. That sort of opportunity where we were the last 2 didn't come up much after that, so we never got the chance for a repeat. At least it happened once so we could both finally say to each other we had really done it. I don't tell this story to people I know for fear of job-related consequences, but I hope reddit at least gets some entertainment out of it...",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_1kdowv,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kdowv/i_had_sex_in_a_top_secret_cleared_facility/,

He's been really supportive about it and has been great to talk to. 

A few weeks ago we got ungodly high and wasted alone with each other. On a different occasion he did drunkenly ask if I'd give him head and I said no because no matter if he said he wanted it, things would be different after and I couldn't handle losing him as a friend. 

Well, this time I didn't say no. We've had a kind of toxic relationship when it comes to partying and this was no different. High and drunk as hell and awake for 2 straight days. I regret it because although the first couple days after seemed normal, he's become distant and pretty much won't answer his phone anymore. We also work together and on the surface everything seems fine. We laugh, we joke, we've hung out once or twice since with our other friends. 

I fucking knew it was a bad idea and he's straight, there's no way to bring it up and talk about it. God knows he probably wants to pretend it didn't happen, and I don't blame him, but I feel like he at least to some extent hates me for what we did. I feel awful, and I miss my friend. At almost 27 it's fucking hard to meet and make friends with such good people.

In college I lived in a house with five girls; I was one of two other guys.  I started dating one of the girls early in my Junior year, which was sort of against unofficial house rules (just to keep things uncomplicated).  One month into dating, my girlfriend got into a big argument with one of the girls she shared a bathroom with.  

My girlfriend *convinced* me to go into the bedroom of the girl she was fighting with when that girl was out at classes.  She then had me jerk off into the girl's panties while she took pictures.  The last few pictures were of me coming all over the girl's underwear and pillow.  We then proceeded to wash all the items and put them back.  A week later, my girlfriend started sending the pictures to the girl, the comeshot being the last.

The girl flipped out, and while she suspected my girlfriend, she was never quite sure.  Apparently she had fights with a handful of people.  The other problem was, she started blaming one of the other guys in the house for doing.  It eventually got so hostile they had a small physical fight.  Two weeks later they'd both moved out.  I was embarrassed about the whole situation, and felt pretty bad, but my girlfriend enjoyed it to the point of fetishism.

Over the next year, we went through all of the female roommates' underwear and hosiery to the point where she actually started wearing their things while we had sex.  Shortly before we broke it off, she started stealing underwear from girls on campus she thought I was attracted to.  I don't know how she did it, but she would get a hold of their things, and we'd be going at it, and she'd say something like ""This is what it would be like to fuck Kerry Delaney.  This is what she would be wearing.""  I would usually come so hard it was almost painful.

I haven't done this sort of thing since we broke up.  In a criminal psychology class, I found out stealing underwear can be an early indicator of a sex offender in the making (for males), which really creeped me out.

I don't feel depressed.. I just want someone to read this so *somebody* knows. 

I'm 25 if it matters.

I work full time in an office, where i wear a three piece suit daily, and make above average wages, for a job that i find both easy and rewarding. Most everyone but me works from home every day, and I find myself alone in the office, all day, everyday. I speak briefly with clients, and attend lunch/coffee meetings, and these are usually the only interactions I have with people, aside form simple things like ordering food.


When I get off work, I go home, and smoke weed immediately.  Usually a decent sized (1.5g) joint to myself.  Then I'll sit down and watch TV or play xbox.  I smoke about an ounce a month, entirely to myself.  After I smoke the joint I'll puff on and off on my pipe for a few hours, and normally smoke 1-2 more joints later in the evening.   I drink as well, nearly everyday, but not heavily... 2-3 drinks at the most. 

I'm a relatively good looking person, and pretty much the only actual personal interaction I have is with girls I find from dating sites, and have over for sex.  I have perfected the routine of making this happen, and I fucking ashamed about it.  

When these girls stay over, they can't believe i'm putting on a suit the next morning.  Nobody at my work would even believe me if I told them what I do afterwards.  I feel like I'll never find a girlfriend, as I need someone who is OK with my insane amount of weed smoking (pref if they join in), and who also keeps themselves together during the day.

I feel like I have no friends. I have two amazing groups of friends, am I am relatively ""popular with both groups"".   One is people from university who moved to the city where i grew up (im back here now) the other are friends from high school and before and after HS.  I consistently tell both groups im with the other one, and am just keeping my fingers crossed that they don't meet.

(NSFW),badfriend64,57,18,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1g7jim/if_did_something_with_out_my_best_friendsf/,"My best friend let's call her Nikki and I have been best friends for six years.  She is the best friend I have ever had I and I don't know if I'm actually sorry that I did the following events but I need to tell someone so reddit I'm telling you.

Ok the story starts a few days ago when she and I were getting ready for a trip to the beach that we are taking this weekend.  We went shopping for some supplies for the trip when she gets the idea that we should go hang out with another good friend of ours that coming with us I'll can him Dan.  Well we end up at Dan's house just hanging out and enjoying the nice weather this was around 8:30.  Now Dan and I hadn't seen each other in two years due to extenuating circumstances so we spent a lot of time catching up with each other.  Nikki didn't like that she wasn't included in a large part of the conversation so she started to hang all over Dan.

At this point I should note that Dan as been in love with Nikki for six years and she knows this and has never done anything about it even after he actually admitted his love for her she did nothing.  I still don't know how but somehow they remained friends.  Anyway back to the story well a few hours later around midnight we decide that sitting on the wooden benches we had been sitting on was getting very uncomfortable so we all decided to lay down on the large wooden deck table together. The three of us cuddled for hours Dan in the middle and Nikki and I on each side.  Now there was a lot of sexual tension building up as we were doing this but nothing was said or done it was just something you could feel.

Around 2:30 I realize that Dan might have fallen asleep and its late so Nikki and I should get home.  So I wake up Nikki and She wakes up Dan who pulls us both in for a big bear hug which ends with Nikki laying across his lap and me sitting on the table next to him with his arm round around my waist.  Nikki had fallen asleep again while laying on Dan's lap so Dan started moving is hand closer and closer to my inner thighs and he started rubbing my clit through my shorts.  I probably should have stopped him but it felt good so I didn't. He end up fingering me for twenty minutes before I make him stop because its almost 3am.  When he finally stops rubbing my clit we make-out for maybe five more minutes but then I decide its time to go home so I wake up Nikki and she and I leave.

On the car ride home I was so confused by what had just happened between Dan and I that I was visibly shaking and looked very very pale so Nikki ask me what was wrong.  I told her the Dan had fingered me and I wasn't sure what was going on.  At this point all she had to say was if anything happens between the two of you we can't hang out anymore.

The next day I decided to talk to Dan about what had happened the night before.  So I told Nikki what I was doing and she questioned if I was really going to talk with him or if something else was going on.  At this point I all I wanted to do is talk to Dan to tell him that what had happened can never happen again.  That night I go over to Dan's house and we do talk about Nikki's reaction and he is loving how jealous she and how she only seems mad at me and not him. He thought the whole thing was funny.  I feel I should point out that he only felt this way because of his feelings for Nikki.  He wasn't being a jackass to me and I agreed that it was funny that she was jealous of me.

Through the course of the night I end up taking a ride with Dan in his tuck and he has one big bench seat so we are sitting very close together and he put his hand on my leg.  At that point I knew what was going to happen. When we get back to his house neither one of us gets out of the truck we just kinda sit there and then all of a sudden something clicked.

We start making out and he starts grabbing my boobs and it feels good so I take off my shirt and my bra and he starts sucking on my tits.  A few minutes later he pulls out his dick and I give him a blow job. As I'm sucking his dick he keeps telling me how its the best blow job he has ever received which make me just want to keep sucking on him.  Maybe ten minutes later he is fingering me again and it feels fantastic and we both say how much we wanna fuck each other so he grabs a condom and we climb into the back on his truck

As soon as we're both back there we take off what clothes we still had on and go at it.  I was on top first and came after maybe fifteen minutes which was a shock to me because I rarely come that quickly.  When Dan realized that we switch positions so he was on top and he went at me like no man before him.  That was the first night I ever came twice and it was awesome.  After about a hour of fucking in his truck he finishes and we get dressed.  We both agreed not to tell anyone what happened and I left. 

Later Nikki sent me a text asking how the talk went and I told her that everything was gonna to go back to normal to which she responded if we were hiding anything from her our friendship would effectively be over.  The next time I'll see both of them is when we go to the beach but I know they have seen each other since Dan and I fucked.  I really dislike hiding this from her but I don't feel guilty about what happened between Dan and I.

4 Years ago my wife cheated on me. We had been dealing with an autistic child and escalating bills and the recent tragic death of a friend, so she went out to Seattle with a girlfriend of hers to visit various places the friend had wanted to go.  Washington DC had been the first place, this was the second.  An old boyfriend of hers was also living out there but like a naïve fool I didn’t think much of it.

She tried to keep it quiet but I figured it out.  It nearly tore us to pieces and unfortunately took our son along for the ride.  I hit a level of depression I didn’t realize existed. I struck back at friends and family for years of perceived slights.  She tried to explain that she thought I didn’t love her because I had been verbally abusive to her.  

I drank, I smoked, I fucked whores on a very unhealthy and expensive level, until I finally had that moment of clarity.  

I embraced therapy, discovered my ADHD, worked on that. Decided that no matter the end result of our relationship I was going to get myself better.  I couldn’t remember ever being verbally abusive but took her at her word and decided to work on that as well.  I popped the pills, I did the exercises, I meditated, and on the other side of this long harrowing fight, I’ve never been happier.  I feel more comfortable with myself than I ever have, and while not exactly the most confident person ever, I’m worlds from where I was prior to the cheating.

Long before the cheating we had talked about moving to another state.  This had become derailed while we figured each other out.  Once we were on stable grounds we decided to try by playing resume roulette to the locations we had agreed upon: New Jersey, Washington State, Texas, and Massachusetts.

She had a job in Seattle within three weeks.

I was leery but undaunted.  I was sure he was still out here but a small part of me realized: So what. Say he is, say she does, you’re a better man now, and you’ll deal, move on and be happier anyway.

We moved out, in 4 months, I got a dream job. No lie, this is the job, there will never be another. They could cut my pay and I would stay. (That statement alone is half the reason I did a burn account.) But the marriage wasn’t working. Trust was shattered and not coming back. We agreed to split but we had recently rented a house so I would live in the same house so our son’s life wouldn’t go into to much of an upheaval and also to save money.  We made conditions: No bringing boyfriends or girlfriends to the house without the other person meeting them first and only if it was serious.  I made one simple condition: Please don’t contact the old boyfriend until we’ve completely settled this. She had agreed and made no condition like that with me.

While it’s summer time her mother came out to help us with our son while we worked, so my “bedroom” wasn’t ready.  We were going to wait until the end of summer before her mom left, tell her what’s going on with us, then talk to our child about it and I would move into the basement.  In the meantime we still share a bed.

I contacted an old friend that she had not liked and who I had given up to try and repair our marriage.  I went out and tried to see other people, but it was difficult. I wasn’t ready for a relationship which turned off half the potentials, those looking for something less casual were turned off by my living with my ex.   The idea of a prostitute popped into my head again, but money was tight so I tapped it down.

On Sunday a stray thought entered my head and wouldn’t leave.  I asked her if she was talking with him and she was evasive.

I was floored.  We argued, she said that since I contacted my old friend she didn’t see why she couldn’t.  

I pointed out:
1) Because she promised 

2) Because I never had sex with my friend while married to her. 

She still didn’t understand the big deal until I pointed out two last things:

1) She asked me to promise I would be her friend, and now I cannot. (Because this man is a manipulative prick who would call her swearing he was going to kill himself over and over, only to never do it.  He once told her that if she doesn’t hear from him after his birthday it’s cause he killed himself then, and she had a meltdown for two days after his birthday until he contacted her. )

2) I can never tell my family about her talking with this guy. Because even I have a hard time believing this WHOLE thing wasn’t just a big ol’ trick to get to Seattle.

I walked out after that. Walked around for over an hour and calmly decided what I was going to do.

I was going to find a prostitute, because it had been 3 years since I had some sex and I’d be damned if I was holding off one more night.  After that I was going to introduce my body to as much alcohol as it could stand then I would sleep it off.

I went home, told her I was going out the next night and not coming back till late.  I did research and found a reasonably priced girl that was local. And who seemed fine.  Then I found a video game style pub that had Xbox Games you could play while drinking and having Nachos and shit.  Laid and video games, perfect night right?

Next night I went to the woman’s apartment. I wasn’t nervous, but I probably should have been.  The pictures on her site were glimpses of her body which looked great.  She opened the door.

Fucking Internet Photo Voodoo.

It was her from the pictures, no doubt, but holy shit was she HUGE. You can call me all the names you want ladies but if you’re advertising your body and hiding it, you got issues and you are trying to manipulate your customers.  She worked her mouth well which helped but I just couldn’t get myself excited for it.  I tried for 30 straight minutes then finally just faked an orgasm into the condom. (Lube covered up I hadn’t done a damn thing) Then I hightailed it out of there.

I felt down, and a hundred dollars poorer, but figured I could salvage the night.  I did actually. The pub was awesome. Got a table, a whisky, a bowl of nachos and a copy of Assassins Creed 3. I had brought my GamerTag on a thumb drive and managed to rack up some Gamerscore to boot.  The guys were nice, the bar was awesome, I would be back soon.

Now I’m heading home and a stray thought hits me.  For being a technology sector, Seattle has a ton of porn stores. I mean you would think with the abundance of porn on the web who would need a store? During one of my travels I had passed one that proudly claimed to be 24-7.  

A 24-7 porn store? Really? What for? Wait, it has a theater too?? Like 70’s sleazy style theater?? 

The stray thought hit, fuck it. I’m going to check it out.

I go there, and there it is. Porn. Up and down the walls. On the side. Next to lubes and condoms of rainbow proportions and outfits and toys.  Then a man walked passed me, into an area that I thought was off limits and out a door.

“Where does that go?”

“To the theaters in the basement.”

“How does that work?”

“Its twelve bucks for 6 hours, there are four rooms showing different movies in a loop. Come and go as you please.”

“I’ll take one ticket please.”

Through the doorway, took a left.  Opened the door and walked down a set of stairs outside into a basement. 

I walked in to a medium room with a giant flat screen showing some blonde getting a proper pounding.  Some chairs, regular chairs not folding or theater style chairs, were scattered around in various positions.  There was a door going back just to the left of the blonde pounding, going straight back into another room, and another door directly left of that going into a room to the left.  

I tried the straight back room, and saw a man suck another man’s dick.  I didn’t even stick around to notice if anyone was watching the movie.

In the room to the left, was a video of a woman being gang banged and a bunch of actual people.  I noticed there was another room off to the left, and then noticed two people standing between those rooms making out.

It was then that I noticed the entire room watching them and not the porn.

I casually walked by and into the last room, which was empty save for two men, one dressed like a woman, sitting there jerking each other off, on the screen was a BDSM flick.  

First observation is how amazing it is that everyone notices each other but there’s never eye contact, like that’s the thing that’s going to bring out the shame.  The second observation is that I didn’t feel shame being her.  I was curious and I was letting my eyes adjust to the darkness.  Looking back towards the door the man and woman were still making out and he was now taking off her clothes.

I think of myself as somewhat worldly, but I had never heard about couples putting on a show in porn theaters before.  This was a bucket list moment I wasn’t about to miss.

The couple continue to make it, and she continued to lose clothing. She seemed attractive enough, and her moans seemed real.  Then came the really interesting part of the night.  The two of them came into the BDSM room where the man put a chair in the center of the room and the naked woman sat down.  The man then announced that she doesn’t want to be touched, but any many could cum on her body if they wanted.

And then three men lined up.

And sure enough, I witnessed a live bukake.  I didn’t partake, I just watched.  I walked out and upstairs.  It was an interesting rush, I felt the desire for a cigarette and asked the cashier about it.  She pointed out a place a block down the road. I walked out and saw a man who was just in the theater a moment ago, start walking back in, this time with a staggeringly beautiful woman.

“Karma obviously doesn’t want me smoking.” So like a puppy following the food bowl, I kept a casual distance just behind the two and followed them into the theater.

By this time everyone who had been left were spread out in different rooms.  Three in blonde room, dunno if there was anyone in GAY room, 4 guys in Gang Bang room and 2 in BDSM.  A number which became 6 when the couple, myself, and another man who followed me from upstairs when he saw what had walked in.  The woman and man sat in a corner, and it didn’t take long for all the rooms to empty and converge on BDSM.

The girl had a tight body and was vocal, she didn’t like the movie and so they left. Heading back into the blonde room where she had no problem dropping down and putting her partner’s cock in her mouth.  10 people surrounded them, myself included.

She worked him like a pro then he stood up and she sat down.  She worked him more while hi fingered her and she moaned.  Finally he said the words the gathered men were waiting for:

“She needs a dick for each hand, don’t touch her or cum on her.”

Sure enough, two guys walked right up and she started hand jobs on each of them while keeping her mans dick in her mouth. Then he pulled back, leaving her with dicks in her hands, and she started to suck on the dicks of each of the men.

One tried to reach for her pussy and was yelled at and replaced.  

“You’re lucky she’s sucking your dicks!” and the man left the theater.  The boyfriend asked for another and one stood in front.  Hand job to the left, hand job to the right, blow job in front.  Head moving between three cocks dangling from her face.

Now I was aroused. She was beautiful, she was losing clothing by the second, and there was no coercion or anything like that I could detect. The boyfriend may have been the director and protector, but she was completely in charge and she was loving this.

She bent over two chairs, and her boyfriend started to fuck her from behind while three happy guys enjoyed themselves.  The boyfriend came, and the girl said her mouth was dry.  The man being pleasured by her mouth basically said BRB and ran out the door.  The man on her right hand stood there, cock out, waiting while she rested. The man on her left walked to a corner and finished off with three strokes of his cock.  

The boyfriend kept her hot while waiting for her drink, and in no time the man came back with un-cracked bottles of water. She immediately announced that he gets a fuck for that.  Water man at her mouth, the previous man to her right, an empty spot to her left, the words came out before I realized I had said them.

“May I take the left?”

The boyfriend said yes.

I walked over, not even realizing I had already undid my pants and had my hard cock already out.  She grabbed it immediately and took it into her mouth.

Ladies a piece of advice, if you don’t like sucking cock, just don’t do it. You may be able to get technique down no problem, but your actions will be simply that, technique. For the first time in my life I had woman suck on my cock not out of obligation or because it was what I wanted, it was because SHE wanted it, and every tug and lick proved it.

I asked for permission to touch her tits, and was granted and thanked for asking. I played with her nipples and would like to think it elicited the moans she gave off, but I’m pretty sure that was because water man had moved from her mouth to her pussy.  

She switched positions, and asked to ride water man, leaving my cock quietly aching, so I stroked It twice and rewarded the wall with my semen, crying out louder than I ever have.  

When the night ended I thanked her, and let her know I did a Jackson Pollack in her honor on the wall, which she and the boyfriend laughed about.  Then I left, walking out at the same time as the man who had followed ME down with them.

We didn’t say a word, but at the top of the stairs we smiled at other, the only eye contact we made all night.  

He said: “I’m gonna have to come here more often.”

“Me too” I replied.

I’m not sure if I actually will, because I basically stood on a spot and got struck by lightning twice.  I’ve come to learn that the chances of a couple doing things like this in a porn theater is actually quite high.  The chances of it being with a hot woman however.. 

No, I don’t think I will go back. I’ve had an experience the likes of which few people ever will. I’ve never felt more alive in my life.  I’ll simply confess what I did here. Keep working my job and moving forward with my life. Get my tests to make sure I didn’t just do something really stupid, and save this little nugget in my brain forever.

The confession part of all this? I don’t feel shame, like I thought I would. I don’t feel guilty, and I certainly do not think I did anything wrong.  If there’s some kind of moral to all this it is: Don’t think you know everything, because there’s always something out there unexpected.

On a whim, I walked off the street and into a software company office to ask if they needed interns. The next day, this software company launched a product that became an unexpected success.

Since I was the only non-developer who was working on the product, I ended up being the jack of all trades. I did the marketing, blogging, customer service, PR, SEO — all that jazz — and I did it well. 

A few months later, this product spun out as its own company. I was employee #6 — and as a result, I was given stock. Lots of it. 

We then went through 3 rounds of financing, as well as a couple stock splits. As a result, the worth of my stock has become exponentially higher. Here's where things get interesting. 

In one month, we'll be closing one more round of financing. When this happens the worth of my stock will be worth millions of dollars. 

But it's all theoretical. I don't become fully exercised until December. We haven't had an IPO. As good as this business is (we are making a lot of money!) things change. When the next round of financing closes, I will only be able to sell 5% of my shares — which means the money that I will be receiving will only be a sliver of my worth. 

The rest of my shares are pretty much locked up until either our company gets bought *or* we have an IPO.

Making things more interesting to me is one more singular fact: as this company gets bigger (we have well over 700 employees now!), my responsibilities have dwindled. I no longer do any marketing, blogging, customer service, PR, or SEO. All I do with my time now is look over reports and develop product road maps. 

I feel I've got a lot more to give the world, and I really miss being in a small start-up. But hey, if remaining here secures my future, as well as my family's... what the hell?

I've written this out before but something made me delete it before submitting it. Besides, it's all 100% honest.

Anyway, there's this girl I've known for a couple of years. We awkwardly first talked over Facebook even though she literally sat behind me in German class. Somehow, we started talking more and became best friends.

One day, she invited me over to her house to watch a movie with her or something after school, I don't really remember. I do  remember feeling distinctly happy - it was the first time anyone's ever done such a thing. I've never really been a sociable person and new friendships come few and far in between.

I developed a pretty strong crush on her after that. She's beautiful, of course, but also extremely intelligent. The only problem was that she had a boyfriend. I tried to remain pretty neutral on it - I didn't want to piss her off by being mean to her boyfriend. They'd been together for about a year or something before we even met. Months went by, our friendship grew, receded, grew again. I can be a vindictive, obnoxious person and it's something I've always felt really guilty about.

Honestly, if I could do things over again, I would. I'd probably be nicer to her and I would've been more patient. She's wonderful and I hate that I've pushed her away so many times and that I've broken her trust. It hurts to think that we'll probably never talk all night on the phone again like we used to. Some of my fondest memories are of her asking me to keep talking about something so she could fall asleep to my voice. She probably wouldn't even remember if I asked her about it.

At some point, I found myself another girlfriend and started pushing her away. Like she just pointed out tonight, I tend to subconsciously rub it in her face. Like I said, I can be vindictive - I guess I do it because she's always had a boyfriend when I wanted her. We came close to being together quite a few times, and I regret not taking at least one of those chances more than I regret anything else in my life. I haven't exactly lived a difficult life, so I don't think it's far-fetched to say such a thing.

My girlfriend and I met almost 2 years ago. Prior to that I had been single for maybe 3 years, going on dates here and there, but no real relationships, and no sex. I’d had one serious relationship before that during high school/college that lasted 3 years before she ended up cheating on me. Anyways, when we started dating, both at 27 everything was great. We had a lot of common interests, we had conversations, we had a LOT of fun together and sex was amazing. I should mention that I had lived at my parents house up until shortly after we started dating. After maybe two months I moved across town into an apartment on my own that was only 10 minutes from her place, but I had been planning to move to that side of the city anyways because of work. Maybe 3 months into the relationship, we were at her apartment being intimate, and i…I’m not even sure what exactly I did, I think I tried to shift my position, or I tried to lift her up a bit, and anyway, whatever it was she suddenly pushed me off of her and ran into the bathroom, slamming the door. I was completely confused, had no idea what happened and thought I had hurt her or something, so I just sit there with no pants on and a stupid look on my face. After a minute or so I hear her crying in the bathroom and I call out, is everything okay, do you need anything, did I do something wrong, and she says No, you didn’t do anything wrong, but can you please just leave. So dumbfounded, I dress and leave. A couple of days later after some generic how are you, whats up texts we meet up again, and she confesses to me whatever it was we did, it reminded her of what happened with her ex. And then I get the story. Out of college, the guy she was dating was very, very abusive to her. He hit her, he somewhat raped her a couple times, cut off all her hair once when he was mad at her, some SERIOUS physical and emotional abuse. and after 2 years, when she finally built up the courage to end it with this shitstain, he tried to kill her by stabbing her. He only cut her, she broke his wrist, cops were called, he was arrested (but didn’t go to jail for whatever reason, I didn’t get all the details and didn’t want to force them out of her, she could tell me however much of it she wanted to.)  And then she tells me about the selfcutting (which I pretty much knew about, seeing the scars on her arms, but never mentioned, none of my business) and an attempted suicide. I was really kinda shocked and not really sure what to do or say or even think about all this. Anyways, time goes on, and I figure, okay, well, I’m not going to hit her or abuse her, or even be mean to her. I’m a pacifist, and I’m very quickly falling in love with this girl. Just because some shitstain mistreated her in the past doesn’t mean she doesn’t have the right to be happy. I wanted to be her hero. I wanted to be the one who did make her happy. I wanted her to see me as some knight in shining armor or something. I don’t know. So I stuck with the relationship. Most of the time we were just fine. But every once in a while she would just shut down emotionally. She’d get really, really depressed, and I tried my best to cheer her up and do whatever I could for her. And I thought, okay, these are the types of problems I commited to deal with in staying in the relationship. She started seeing a therapist, which helped a lot in the beginning. It allowed her to open up to me and be more comfortable with me in many different aspects of the relationship. And when she’d get depressed she would always tell me “it’s nothing you did, I’m just sad, and there’s nothing wrong with being sad just because.” And while I’ve never been truly depressed, this sounded weird to me, but hey, no problem, if that’s how she felt. Now me, I’m a pretty social person, I have a group of very close friends that I’ve known since high school, and whom I’ve been through a lot with. She is the polar opposite of that. She has no specific friends and does not enjoy being in any sort of social setting. When we first started dating I told her that I smoke a lot of pot, and that I enjoy drinking on weekends and such. And she said, oh, that’s no problem! I don’t care! (I’ll point out that this was one of the main reasons my last relationship failed, she hated that I smoked and drank, and I wouldn’t give it up for her.) Fast forward 10 months, and a friend of mine got into a really shitty situation, and I let him move in with me, under the condition it would be temporary, and he’d pay his share. No problems. My friend and I barely even saw eachother at the apartment because of work scheduled and I spent most of my time at her place anyways. (I notice this is getting long, so I’ll cut to the chase). My gf and I had discussed moving in together and agreed we should date for 2 years before doing so. But when my friend moved in with me she got jealous, I don’t even know why as it didn’t impact our relationship at all. She wanted us to get a place together. In a way it did make sense as it would save us both quite a bit on rent. So we get an apartment, and my friend moves into her old apartment. Before we move in together I remind her, I say, “You know moving in is a big step, we’re going to learn new things about each other, you know I smoke a lot of pot, and you’re going to be exposed to that a lot more living with me. “No problem! I don’t mind at all, you can do what you’d like.”  So we’re moving in together, and maybe once a week or once every two week I would go out to meet up with my friends. I tried to get her involved, but she had no interest. So she suggests we should get a dog! Then she wont be lonely when I go out! I’ve never had a dog and neither had she, so we saw it as a good challenge together. So we get the dog. She ‘s lucky enough to have a job that is dog friendly, so she actually gets to take the dog to work with her every day, since it’s a puppy this is kinda needed, as it needs a lot of care. I told her this would be a lot of responsibility and will cut into her work time, Yes, yes she knows that and is up for the challenge. So here we are, several months after moving in together, we’ve signed a 1 year lease. We’ve gotten an animal that will live for 15 years, we’ve made commitments. And I hate her. I can’t stand her anymore. She no longer get’s depressed because shes just sad, now she gets depressed because I don’t do my share of cleaning the apartment, (which I most certainly do, i guess dishes every night, the laundry every week, taking out garbage recycling, scrubbing the bathroom and kitchen regularly, cleaning up the dog waste, tidying up every day when i get home is not my fair share) or she’s terrified I’m going to cheat on her( I would never, I’ve had it happen to me), or I want other girls (I don’t, I just want a companion who will love me for me). And just recently, oh ya, she figured out that she hates alchohol and pot. She hates that I do it. She hates the way I handle things (I am responsible with my recreational intoxication) , she hates the way I talk to her. She hates the way handle the dog, she hates the way I present myself, which she loved about me when we first met. Early we thought maybe, one day in the future, we could have a kid together, but now, no way, she hates children and never wants to have one. I can’t even go see my family with her because my sister has a young child. And I can't go see my family by myself cause then I'm either secretly cheating on her (in her mind) or don't want to spend time with her. So I don't see my family anymore, and I don't see my friends anymore. I can't do any of things I find enjoyment in (spending all night out with my telescope for example, this isn't just getting drunk and high). When we have arguments she ""threatens"" me that she'll just kill herself if we break up, which makes me really uncomfortable. 

I’m miserable, but I’ve made commitments. I’m pretty sure she is miserable too. And I just want to either jump in my car and abandon my entire life, or just kill myself (I wouldn't kill myself really, but i think about it a lot)

**tl;dr: I hate my girlfriend of almost 2 years and life we started together** 

edit: another thing I want to confess is that she never told me her ex's name. I'm ashamed to admit that through snooping I found out his name (I never snooped anything, anything else and never went onto her phone, comp or personal stuff again). With his name, I found out what he looks like, where he lives, and where he works. I called in sick to work one day, without telling her and spend most of that day parked outside his work, seriously considering simply walking up to him and stabbing him in the throat for what he did to her. But I probably won't do that. 

edit 2: sorry ha, should also mention, I don't hate the dog. But I do hate the fact that we have a young dog, that she would not be able to train and raise by herself.

From outside, they look like a normal family, but there's a rather disturbing thing about them.

They are a family of 8 - parents, 5 sons and an adopted daughter. The mother has always treated the daughter as a slave for her family. She has to clean, cook and wash clothes for everyone in the family. She has been doing this for about 20 years now, but all she gets are mean words, occasional slaps and a constant reminder that her mother was a whore( she was found abandoned at a hospital).

But there's more.

Last week, she came to my house, she was horny, I was single. We fucked. And after that she told me that 4 out of 5 brothers have molested her. She has to share a room with one of the brothers, and he constantly tries to force himself on her. If she doesn't wish to have sex with him, then she has to give a BJ just for him to leave her alone. She told me, even though she is not biologically related with them, she is disgusted with the idea of having sex with them. The brothers constantly grope her when she is working, she has learned to ignore it.

So I asked her, if her mother knew about it all, which is when she told me something even more unfortunate.

Her father molests her too. It seems when she was 11, the mother had gone to her parents house. That night he came home drunk and tried to force himself on her. Only when she started to scream, he left her alone. She told me her father still likes to mention that incident to her in front of her mother. He claims he could have had her that night and noone could do anything about it. 

Some years later, she was raped by her cousin, and then her father and then by her brothers all on separate occasions. 

More recently, one day her friend had come and was staying at her place. So, that night she and her friend were sleeping in parents room but different beds. Sometime in the night she woke up with her dad cuddling to her even though her friend was sleeping right next to her. And the mom was up too. All she was saying was - leave that whore there and come back to bed with me.

In the past, whenever she tried to talk to her mom about her brothers and father - she would blame her saying she was a whore's daughter and that's the cause of it all.

Today I got a chance to talk with her again. It seems her dad is badgering her for a BJ and was willing to pay for it. And her mother is now looking for alliances for her. And she overheard her mother talking to her relative saying - I don't care what he does or looks like, any guy is ok. The mother is now planning to marry her off to a mentally challenged guy.

I don't even know who is the bigger monster here - the brothers, the father, the mother or me as I was playing with her boobs and ass both times (last time in my room and today on a dark strip of the road) as she told me her story.



**TL;DR**

Brothers and father molest an adopted daughter. Mom knows but blames the girl. I might be a monster too.


Not sure if this the right sub. Apologies.

I'm socially acceptable but deep down uncomfortable. I've made this shield, this illusion that I'm part of this social game but really I hate it. It's not that I have anxiety, I just don't like these social gatherings. But I'm good at them when I have to be.

I'm constantly changing my mind on things. I strive for perfection, more so than achievement. It's not about my image to other people but to myself.

I'm easily disappointed when things don't go my way.

I fall in love easily. I'm needy. I get attached. And it's a matter of insecurity and loneliness.

I'm alone. Most of the time I like it, but not when it's not by choice. It's hard for me to make genuine friends. And when I do have genuine friends, I fuck it up due to my narcissism.

I pretend like I don't care what people think of me. But it couldn't be farther from the truth. In fact, to make people like me, I pretend that I don't care if people like me. It's pathetic.

I'll never be satisfied with myself.

I'm unhappy about my body image, always, even though I'm in relatively healthy shape. It's probably from my past.

I was only in love with my past girlfriends because they were in love with me. It was a possessive thing. It wasn't anything in particular about them that I liked beyond the attention and the nurturing aspect, which any girl can provide.

I have an inflated self sense of worth to compensate for these insecurities.

First, let me tell you that I don't have a good relationship with my mother.  She was one of those women that planned on marrying a rich man and being a SAHM.  Never happened.  My father was an abusive drunk and they divorced when I was about 11 years old.  She immediately marries another asshole. My mother is a narcissist.  She is not nurturing and she never showed any empathy.  All she does is blow money on shit she doesn't need and travel.   All 4 of her kids are bodies with no soul.  We are all fucked up.  This fact does not keep her awake at night.  I have no relationship with her at this time.  I am only waiting for her to die.

I think my relationship with my mother is a big reason why I hate other women.  Not the only reason though.  Women have always been mean to me.  Some early memories include my paternal grandma buying gifts for my older brothers and nothing for me- I was 2 years old.  She also went on to treat me like shit every time I visited her.  Next, there was the parent of a disabled child who was very wealthy and very active at her daughter's school.  For some unknown reason, she did not like me either.  I was the only girl not invited to her daughter's birthday party. she would ignore me when she substituted class among other things.  I didn't understand why this adult was so mean to a 7 year old; I did nothing to her.  

Fast forward to high school where I went to an all-girl high school where I was HATED for no REASON. I should let you know that I was a shy, quiet child who had a horrible home life.  I guess that somehow made me a target to other girls because they fucking hated me.  Whispered to each other in front of me, giggled and ran away.  Gossiped about me, throw snow at me, called me names.  I never did anything to these girls.  I never understood all the hate.  I was treated very badly.  College was not as bad but there were still instances where I would be harassed by other girls.  Given dirty looks, called names from them driving by in their cars, purposely excluded, etc.

Then the job world came and I entered a workforce made up predominately of females.  Again, the shit starts.  Gossiped about, excluded, tried to get me fired. harassment. This went on for a long time.  I made friends at work one time only to have one of them date a man I was seeing behind my back.  They invited me along to bars and gatherings because I attract men.  They were using me.  I cut them out of my life recently.

Today, I'm currently not working so I deal with people on a limited basis.  The very few times I do things in public like go to the gym, grocery shop, get my nails done, I am met with nasty glances, looked up and down, being stared at and occasionally the catty comment (FROM and ABSOLUTE STRANGER).

I have no idea why I am constantly a target for bitches.  I thought as I get older it would get easier.  It hasn't.  Why do these cunts make everything I do so difficult?  I am sick and tired of IGNORING them.  That doesn't work.  

I HAVE A GODDAMN RIGHT to exist too.  I have done nothing to you cunts.  I mind my own business and don't bother anyone.  I'm still a quiet person, is that   fucking CRIME?????????

I don't want your fat, miserable, ugly husbands.  It's NOT MY FAULT IF YOU FUCKING HATE YOURSELF!!  GET A LIFE!  Quit traveling in herds so you can have the delusion of being stronger when you pick on a ""WEAKLING"".  YOU""RE PATHETIC!!

LIFE IS NOT A COMPETITION!!!  NO ONE IS KEEPING SCORE!  ANYONE with half a brain knows the illusion you put on to the outside world is just a cover up for your unhappy marriage, your sagging tits, your ungrateful children and your pointless job.

I prefer not to have any female friends because all of you suck so badly.  It's so obvious that you hate yourself.  

If I never make a female ""friend"" again then that is all right with me.

So I looked up to him, like an older brother or even a father. (since mine wasn't around at the time) We always did things, went swimming, got ice cream, went on road trips. You know, the usual things families do together. He leaned on me sometimes though, told me his relationship problems with my sister or stress he had at work. We had become pretty close.

A few months after I had turned ten, it was storming and there was a lot of lightning. So we went up to the beach and watched the lightning over the lake while my sister was at work. (These random adventures were normal) But one thing different happened that night that would change my life forever. We got to talking, music was playing. I thought it was pretty romantic, really. Then he leaned over and kissed me and I got a little frightened. and thats when he grabbed me and raped me, I won't go into any more detail because it still shakes me to this day. 

I trusted this man with my life, I never thought he would hurt me like he did. In fact, I didn't think that kind of pain existed. But I never told anyone about what happened that night. Mainly because he kept in touch afterwards, (he broke up with my sister a few weeks after the incident) he would tell me things like how he loved me, and how he would wait for me. He did this for about a year or so. I thought I was in love, I know now that I was brainwashed. 

I'm going on 18 now, and have been with my boyfriend for 2 years. I want him to know, but I'm afraid of how he will react. And if you're wondering, my sisters boyfriend was around 20 at the time.

My dad raped me. I am left with daddy issues.

I have cheated on every boyfriend I have ever had.

I am a sex addict.

I have committment issues and never stay in a relationship longer than a months.

I have fucked 10 different guys. I am only 16...

I used to cut myself when i was 13.

I use lying as a defense. Eg. someone asks about my family, especially my dad, I lie.

I actually hate my brother and wish he were dead multiple times a day.

I cant stop masturbating. 

I have NEVER EVER EVERRRR had a real orgasm during sex. I fake it every time. 

I am turned off by straight porn. I prefer same sex. I dont even know why.

I enjoy watching girls being licked out by dogs.

I had an affair with a 36 year old married man when i was 15.

I had an affair with a 40 year old married man when i turned 16. He even paid me to sleep with him. But i didnt.

I have had an affair with two teachers at two different schools.

I have lied about my age to men for two years. 
My dad forced me to have sex with his work collegue when I was 11. I enjoyed it and still fantasize about him frequently.

I was addicted to heroin when I was 10. (All thanks to my father. apparently he wanted me to 'know my limits')

In the first two weeks at a new school, (moved school becaue everyone was calling me a slut) I had sex with someone and then had to move schools again.

I have severe anxiety problems, which cause me to sometimes get shakes, or makes me tremble for hours on end. to the point where i cant do anything. Similar to Parkisons.

I want to be a psychologist. Ironic hey? That, or a prostitute.

EDIT: Let us not forget this is a confession, and not rape victims anonymous. I do appreciate all the advice people are giving me but trust me, you cannot even say one thing I haven't heard before. 

About my brother, just leave him out of it. You will all never understand unless you live with a person every day of your life. You dont see what does to us. You don't know the reason I hate him. So please no more comments.

1368550401.0,32,self.confessions,1ebnu9,I think I am a psychopath,remorselessthrowaway,54,22,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1ebnu9/i_think_i_am_a_psychopath/,"TL;DR: I am a successful, intelligent sociopath.  I have most or all of the ""internal"" traits, but don't display the ""external"" traits.  Not because they are bad, or immoral, but because I have no particular desire to, or because I judge the repurcussions to outweigh the pleasure I might get.

Whether you use the term psychopath, or sociopath, or antisocial personality disorder, so many of the traits feel self-descriptive I don't see how it could be wrong.

Traits normally associated with these terms are: lack of empathy and remorse, egocentricity, manipulativeness, and impulsivity. ASPD is characterized by at least three of the following: 

* Callous unconcern for the feelings of others;
* Gross and persistent attitude of irresponsibility and disregard for social norms, rules, and obligations;
* Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships, though having no difficulty in establishing them;
* Very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression, including violence;
* Incapacity to experience guilt or to profit from experience, particularly punishment;
* Marked readiness to blame others or to offer plausible rationalizations for the behavior that has brought the person into conflict with society.

I haven't committed any of the crimes one might normally associate with these disorders (murder, assault, rape, etc).  But the overriding reason is that risk of capture combined with severity of punishments make it not worth it to me.  I'm not a sadist - I don't crave violence.  I just don't care.  If I thought I could kill my wife's ex-husband with no repurcussions, I would probably do it.

I pretend to have Asperger's.  I might actually have it, I suppose, but I don't know if that's relevant.  I have to fake things like guilt or empathy, and Asperger's is a more acceptable excuse for why I get things wrong than sociopathy.

I fake emotional reactions all the time.  My wife is sexy and a good wife.  My life would be more difficult without her.  So I pretend to feel bad when she is in pain, or feel guity when I've upset her.  But if I didn't have to, I'd just play video games until she stopped crying.

My wife is not my first wife.  My first wife gained a lot of weight, and lost her labido due to anti-depressants.  So I started looking for sex partners online.  I always told them I was in an open marriage.  When I started spending time with my current wife, she got tired of being pulled in multiple directions (she was also married, although she had a better excuse -- her husband was an abusive jackass).  So she said I needed to decide.  I chose her easily.  She was way hotter and liked sex a lot more.

I lie all the time.  Whenever I think I can get away with it.  I'm not a pathological liar - I lie when it will benefit me to do so.  But if I judge that the consequences of truth will be minor enough, I will be honest -- all the better to make my lies more believable.

When I was a kid, I had some issues with being cruel to my pets, firestarting and bedwetting.  These traits are known as the Macdonald triad, and are linked to homicidal behavoir.  I don't do them anymore, because I don't get pleasure out of them.

I don't think I'm alone.  I think the sociopaths that get studied, or end up on the news, are stupid, or flawed. Intellegent sociopathy, without sadism, is a survival trait.  One that, I think, explains politicians and CEOs (in general).

I'm in my 30s, she's early 20s. I've heard creepier. Also, it's handy to know I've got a live-in girlfriend who is my age. That figures in to my actions.

She came and sat in at our gaming table on a night I was GMing (just so we're setting the stage for what kind of nerd I am). She fit right into the group, and she was amazingly beautiful.

I'm not sure, but I think she flirted with me at a party. Even if it was true, I chalk it up to being the least creepy guy there, and one of the only ones who wasn't just trying to get in her pants. I had quit drinking before I got too wasted to drive. She was smart-girl drinking, where she just sorta hung out with a drink for most of the night and didn't really consume too much. Everyone was really drunk, except for us. Then we got high. She made it a point to sit by me, she kept doing that thing girls do where you say something funny, and they touch your shoulder, lean in and laugh. She made me feel ten feet tall, and I don't even think it was on purpose. Those things don't happen to me.

She had been refilling my water for most of the night, so in an effort to be a cool guy, I went and refilled my own damn water. She followed me inside and asked me where I lived. It might have been small talk, and I have to keep telling myself it was.

Later, after we got back, she asks me if I want to go tailgate with her for a while. My instincts are all crying ""no, dude, don't do it."" I end up going, but make sure I'm not alone with her. 

At the end of the night, it's about 3AM and we're sitting in a bed in my friend's room. She says something about more people being able to fit on the bed, and before I know what I'm doing I say something about cuddling. She doesn't seem to reject this idea, but I play it off as a joke.

I leave. I tell my best friends about it the next day. They all say I did the right thing. My closest friend tells me I was probably misinterpreting things, and I kinda think he's right, but the ""look on the bright side"" part of my brain tells me I didn't.

She's from out of town. She wants to skype in to our table again some night and finish the game she started with us. All I want is for a few members of the group to take a week off so I can take her up on it. I just want an excuse.

I will probably never pursue this. I'll carry it with me for a long time, like I do when these things happen, and eventually I'll write it out and feel better. But for now, I think about her too much. The first week after that party, I woke up every morning asking myself why I didn't see what was down that path (even though I knew what was down that path, and it wasn't good). It's not so bad now, but I still get a weird feeling, a feeling I've had before, when I think about her, sort of weird fluttering thing in my chest. She's gorgeous, she's funny, and she's into a lot of my scenes. 

I can't stop playing out what-if scenarios. I can't stop thinking about the story we would have made if things had been different.

I love my girlfriend a lot. I'd never stray on her, I'd never hurt her like that, but part of me feels guilty. And the weird part is, I kinda like that too. The forbidden fruit nature of this girl, whether she was flirting with me or not, is a massive part of my draw to her.

In the mean time, I wake up every morning, go to my job, and attend classes. And in my free time, I write the next leg of that tabletop adventure, hoping she'll get to Skype in and I'll get to see her again. This isn't anything I'd ever pursue unless the winds were blowing right, but it's still a nice feeling. I don't want it to go away.

She mentioned that her other friend  just moved out of state and left behind boxes of clothing, household knick knacks, shitty magazines &amp; general girl stuff that becomes forgotten about during a move. Friend says that I should take whatever I want before it gets dropped off at the thrift store, so I begin rummaging.

I just kicked my junkie ex out of the house a couple weeks ago &amp; had to make his portion of the rent, leaving me behind until my monthly pay check. 
I know I *could* track down her address &amp; send it to her... But honestly, I justify it by the likelihood that some stranger would have purchased this $1.50 picture frame &amp; would have come up $298.50. 

So, what do you say Reddit? Should I Good Samaritan it &amp; send her the cash, probably making her day?

I was 8, my brother was 5, my neighbor was 10. We would get together and have something called 'gay day' and sometimes even my older brother was involved. We'd touch each others penises and kiss. Sometimes we'd even put our penises in each other's mouths or between each other's butts (not inside though).

The worse was one day we pressured my little brother to call himself gay. The neighbor was really persistent and at this point I realized what he was doing was wrong but I didn't stop him. I felt bad. My brother was always a happy child and loved laughing. Since then he has been bitter.

His trauma led to him telling our parents about 5 years later and we were subsequently brought to family therapy. I was reserved and distant. What I did during 'gay day' and to my little brother was suppressed deep into my psyche and I refused to open up. The therapist said to 'watch out for me' as I grew up. 

In my teen years, I pushed away everything that was good to me. I was ashamed and did not believe I deserved good things. I was punishing myself by pushing away love and happiness from others. My friends also were problematic and I had no love life. Luckily I stumbled onto the right things in life and I have changed in many ways. I still do not have the confidence to confess this to anyone outside my immediate family yet, but I at least am telling you now. My eyes are tearing as I write this. My little brother says he's forgiven me but it's taken years for me to finally forgive myself. Thank you for allowing me to tell you my deepest and darkest secret. It has removed a tremendous burden off my chest.

Edit: 
During that time period, I am also guilty of doing the same to my younger cousins. I said it was normal so I touched their penises too.

Just so you know I’m a 21 year old guy…

My whole life I've struggled with anxiety and as I've gotten older it has slowly developed into depression. My parents never took the depression seriously; they assumed that I was a normal teenager. I tried to kill myself twice, at 15 and then again at 17. After that they believed that what I had was serious and I was hospitalised.

Whilst in hospital I saw a therapist who constantly asked me what I thought the cause of my anxiety was, I told him I didn't know.
My parents also asked me the same question; they argued that no one in our family was 'like me' and that there had to be an environmental cause to my anxiety and depression. They also told me about how they noticed that one day I was a normal child and the next day I became what I am.
I ignored this question whenever I was asked it because I never wanted to admit to anyone the real reason why I’m like this.

I remember when I was in primary school; I don’t remember when exactly, it would have been around 98-99 when I was 7-8 years old.
I had been taken out of class by a lady from the reception who told me my mum was there to take me to the dentist, when we go to the reception however, it turns out she had confused me with another student with the same name. She apologised and asked the caretaker who was there if he would walk me back to my class.

He took me to the boiler room first which was in a separate building; he told me he had to quickly do something that he needed my help with. But once the door shut behind us he grabbed my wrists, I remember the next day I had finger shaped bruises on both. He forced my arms across my chest so that they made an ‘X’ shape and then he pushed me onto the ground and kept the palm of his hand on my head and put all of his weight on it so that I couldn’t move.
I started crying when he pulled my trousers off so he grabbed my hair and said that if I wasn’t quiet he would kill me.

He raped me. I remember it hurt. I didn’t like it.

Afterwards he told me he wouldn’t do it again if I didn’t tell anyone, but if I did tell he told me that he would do it again. He seemed upset, which confused me.

I remember walking back, I felt wrong. I could feel blood trickling down my leg but I didn’t care.
I hoped I wouldn’t run into anyone because I didn’t think I could look them in the eye. It was hard holding back the tears; I had to exhale hard to make sure I didn’t cry. 

Sometimes I think this is what broke me, made me what I am today. But sometimes I feel like I’m just using it as an excuse for my anxiety, trying to put the blame on something other than myself. I don’t want to feel responsible for the anxiety so I blame myself as a child instead.

A love of life, a creative fire, a passion for everything. A three-drink buzz can make me cry listening to a great song or watching a great movie. It can move me to create an inspiring presentation, an impassioned plea, a brilliant plan. I love having a three-drink buzz. It feels right, what life is supposed to feel like.

I suspect, but can't confirm, that some people exist in this state all the time without artificial stimulation, without hangovers, without liver damage. I want to be that person. I long to have a three-drink mindset naturally, with no inhibition or pretense. If you live your life this way, please let me know how.

Sometimes life seems beautiful, other times it seems like shit. I know in my heart of hearts that beautiful is better and the right outlook to have, but shit seems more real from a day to day perspective. Having a three-drink buzz makes the beauty real and the shit disappear.

Most of the wrong things I fap to, I don't think I'd actually do in real life, but it somehow gets me off when imagining it, just because it's wrong. It's not even always taboo, sometimes I fap to fat or ugly chicks, I've fapped to old ladies, a few times to pregger chicks. I used to fap to men sometimes, but I think I lost interest after banging a dude once (pitching) and not caring much for it, I've fapped to my sisters as well as my mom, and let me tell you, outside of fapping the thought of even seeing my mom naked is terribly repulsive. I've never really fapped to shit/piss/vomit/blood, except maybe this one time on shrooms, but they weren't any help, I just couldn't stop visualizing them, and it became a mission to get off. 

I should mention that I used to dream about this shit too. I've dreamt about fucking my mom, that was gross. I remember my first CP dream; as young as 14 or 15 I remember having a dream where either I was walking down the sidewalk, or this little girl probably around 5 years old was. Next thing I remember I'd taken her hand and walked her to my place around through the back and to either the rear bathroom or laundry room where I sexed her (consensually). I blew my load pretty much upon penetration (I always blew my load too early in my wet dreams, back when I had them). I realize that sounds extremely predator-like, but what can I say? It was a dream. That was before I ever even looked at CP, which I did a lot of in my teen years, as well as bestiality. I don't ever look that stuff up anymore, partly because it's harder to find, partly because I don't want to risk going to jail, and partly because for the most part I'm a much healthier fapper these days and don't need to see that shit.

I've never really been molested or anything, but I nearly banged my younger sister twice. The first time we were somewhere between 3 and 7 years old, and it involved our older siblings making us lay together naked and trying to fit my obviously limp dick somewhere between her nether-regions while they cheered. Obviously that didn't work out too well. The second time, we were somewhere between 11 and 15, I was a horny ass teenager, and she was just starting to blossom. One day I was super horny and not thinking straight, I let her ""accidentally"" catch a glimpse of my raging boner, I think she said or asked something about it, and we ended up talking about how we both (obviously) never had sex but wanted to try, I suggested that we do.

1300920308.0,30,self.confessions,ga23p,I feel like a terrible mother,cinnamoninitinamin,35,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ga23p/i_feel_like_a_terrible_mother/,"I have twins and they're still infants. Currently my husband and I are living in a 2 bedroom house with his mother, her husband and his daughter, and my husband's brother. With my children, that makes 8 of us in this little house. It doesn't work, there's not enough room, but I digress. I feel like a terrible mother because every day when I wake up I can't wait for the day to be over and the for the kids to go back to bed.

Don't get me wrong, I love my kids. I would do anything for them, to keep them safe and for them to know that they're loved. I'd never do anything to harm them. But sometimes I want to leave. Just pack up my things and go. It wouldn't be permanent, just long enough to regain my sanity. I don't think I'd ever do it, because I love my husband and I love my kids too much. I'm burned out.

When I found out I was pregnant, I was of course thrilled. I've always been told that I wouldn't get pregnant, so when I found out I was it felt like a miracle. A terrifying miracle. A double dose of terrifying miracle. 

My husband was in school full time at the time, and working full time as well. I wasn't able to work due to my high risk pregnancy, so needless to say, money was (and still is) extremely tight. He was attending school throughout my entire pregnancy and the first 4 months after they were born. He was gone from 6am to 11:30 every night. Although I live with other people, they aren't trustworthy enough to ask for help.

My husband has been out of school and working at his new job for the past few months, and although he's home more, he doesn't understand what it feels like to be stuck in the house all day. We have one car, which he has to take to work (an hour and a half away) so there's no option of me driving anywhere to get out of the house. I have a stroller, but our house is on a busy road with no sidewalks and therefore isn't safe. We have no money for babysitters, no money to find another place to live. No money for anything except the very very basics. 

I feel like a terrible mother because I can't take any of it any more. One of my children is going through a shrieking phase, so all day long it's constant ear-piercing screams, which only upsets the other one. I feel such rage at them for the littlest things, and they don't deserve it. They're babies, they're supposed to cry, throw food, throw tantrums, whatever. I have no patience left any more. 

I'm the only one who ever gets up in the middle of the night to feed them, I'm the only one who changes their diapers, my husband only does the ""fun"" stuff with them. I explain to my husband why I'm so burned out, but he doesn't see it. When he gets home, they're all smiles. He doesn't see what it's like the rest of the time. 

I have no privacy, no alone time, and no chance for any any time soon. Whenever I say that I need time to myself, it turns into a ""Why don't you take one of the kids with you?"" I'm made to feel guilty for needing time to myself. I'm made to feel guilty for leaving my husband in charge of both of them. He's perfectly capable, and I trust them with him, but he doesn't want to do it. I can't go take a bath without interruption from the other members of the house, as we have one bathroom. 

I wouldn't do anything to hurt my kids, I just am completely fed up. I've completely lost my identity. I have no time for any of the interests I had before. I spend so much of my time caring for my kids, and what feels like even more time trying to keep their stuff out of everybody else's way. I feel like an abused, ignored, unappreciated, unloved, spat upon, shit on, pissed on, hair pulled, pinched, hit, fat, ugly mommy robot. I need to regain my sanity, but i don't know where to start.

EDIT: Thanks for all the support and kind words. My husband and i have talked about this fairly frequently, but he never realized what a toll all this was taking on me until we talked again yesterday. He suggested I take a day off to myself this weekend, and that we need to schedule regular times for me to be alone and do what I want to do. I think it took me writing this all out to realize how serious it had become. 

We've also decided to move, and while we'll still be living with family, there will be much more room, parks within walking distance, and a safe and clean environment for my kids. It's also so much closer to my husband's work, so we'll be able to save 10-12 hours a week in driving time and gas, which makes a huge difference.

(I'm male) After 4 hookups i realised i didn't feel romantically attracted to men (I couldn't even kiss them with passion), only sexually and that i'm more interested in women. 

It was at that time that some of my closest friends were snooping on my computer and found all sorts of porn, including gay and trans. They confronted me and said they were ok but i hadn't told anyone about my sexual preferences and i wasn't ready neither did i want to. Im pretty sure that this was the reason they started to feel uncomfortable with me and to exclude me gradually from the group until we stopped hanging around entirely. 

I was somewhat paranoid that everyone would know (I live in a european country that is not that progressive) but i repressed all thoughts about those aspects of my sexuality, something that i believe was one of the reasons i eventually became severely depressed. 

After some years living alone and battling depression, and after i thought i had finally overcome it, during a period of intense stress about academics i had a series of psychotic episodes. 

All of them consisted of ""flashbacks"" of false memories considering events related to a forced and shameful ""outing"" which resulted to me attempting suicide (in those memories). The whole experience of the memories was very traumatic and had very real side effects.At first i believed that they had actually occured and that what i was going through was some kind of ptsd. But then people started telling me that nothing had happened, so more memories ""surfaced"" which complicated the story and made me not believe them. What's worse is that this has condition has also modified already existing memories to fit with the false storyline which makes it really hard to distinguish them from reality. Kind of like Total Recall mixed with Shutter Island.

I haven't told my family the content of those memories as i'm afraid that it would alienate them from me. I have only told this to my psychiatrist and only today to my therapist. Even after all of this i continued to repress my sexuality and not speak about it, but today that i had to admit that i'm not a typical straight or gay guy makes me feel uncomfortable, uncertain and somewhat depressed again.

I understand that that isn't a very long time to be best friends, but it's the quality of the relationship and not the quantity, right?
Well we've always liked each other right off the bat. Always made each other laugh and we always just, enjoyed each other's company. I was in a terrible relationship for 3 years on and off and he was there for the last year. He was always there for me through all the tears, i went to him. and i was always there for him.  So throughout the year our feelings for each other grew stronger but only secretly. He had a girlfriend for about 8 or 9 months and he broke it off with her actually just a few days ago. She was a bitch and no one in our group of friends liked her, so not only i, but everyone else were relieved for him.  Now, this best friend of mine moved away across the country, but only for a year. We promised to skype each other a lot and to never lose contact. Tonight i experienced my 2nd mushroom high, and he watched and listened to it all. I invited him to watch my trip to see what it was like to be on mushrooms since he's never done them. I got sick but was feeling just absolutely amazing afterward and my vision was wavy and colorful. I felt cuddly and basically melted into my couch. He was there for me, at least over skype calming me down whenever i started hyperventilating and freaking out, telling me to take deep breaths and that it was all okay. I started crying. When we had our goodbye before he moved away, i didn't really cry. I did by myself but it was nothing like this cry. This beautiful cry, ""i miss you, i want you here"" i felt like i cried for hours, just, for him to be close to me. ""I love you, i love you so much"" and he said it back to me. The mushroom trip just brought out everything i'd been supressing for the entire year and it felt so real, so right. i let it all out in one big cry confessing how much i wanted to be with him, how everything about him makes me smile, how every time im with him, im nothing but happy and i just cried and i felt so vulnerable, but i was so amazed that i felt so good letting all my emotions out. i hated just being his friend for the entire year. Well, i loved it, it was fun, but i always wanted more. I always wanted to be the one to love him. I cried his name and we both told each other we loved and missed each other at least a hundred times. I just wanted to let all this out because we have to hide it from our friends until his now ex calms her bones a little. But i've never been so happy, I've never been so in love with someone. And i want the world to know, there's no one i could be my complete self with and still be 100% comfortable.

I started screaming uncontrollably once I realized he wasn't going to be able to drink the glass of water I had just gotten him, when I first saw that he wasn't feeling ok. His heart failed him. And I failed him too. 

I know I was just a kid, but that's how I feel deep down inside. He was laying on the floor of our kitchen, we were having dinner then. He fell off the chair in a way that makes me jump up with an adrenaline rush everytime I hear a chair breaking. It traumatized me, I suppose. My grandmother was also with us, but she immediately ran to our neighbours' house to call for help. 

To this day, I regret not having the presence of mind to swallow my tears. I should have at least waited for him to loose consciousness completely, untill I unleashed the horror that was inside me. I did not meant for his last memory to be that of his grandson screaming in despair. 

I remember he still managed to pull himself together with all his strenght, in order to try and drink the water I was giving him. He focused his eyes, raised his neck from the floor, looked straight at me and said: ""*calm down, I'm  just coughing*"". After that, his head fell back on my arm, his eyes rolled over and he finally lost consciousness. Doctors said he had an atrial fibrilation, which is usually associated with a flutter or cough sensation in the chest area. Those were his last words.

(Yes, he was abusing us.) I didn't know that there was anything wrong with the pictures, or with the way he treated us. The picture I remember most vividly was of a little black boy, about my age. He was looking directly at the camera, a blank look in his eyes. It wasn't like he was lost in thought... It was like he didn't really even exist anymore. Like his body was here, on earth, in this picture... But his soul and his mind were gone, somewhere far away. I know that look. I felt like that almost every day of my childhood. I didn't know that other people felt that way... Somehow, the knowledge that other people could feel as much pain as I felt... That knowledge was a horrible thing. Worse than anything.

I wanted to be his friend. I'd never had a friend before.

Anyways. I showed the pictures to my mom, she flipped out, my dad said that they must have been left in the house by construction workers who were working on our house, she believed him. 

I haven't thought about it since then. It was fourteen years ago. I'm twenty now. My dad killed himself when I was 14. 

I don't know why this memory popped into my head. I don't know why I keep wondering if that boy is okay. I remember that photo so vividly... It just haunts me for some reason. I've been in therapy for six years. I've worked through so much. 

I just want to be happy. I just want to be normal. I look and act so goddamn normal. I have blue eyes, and long blonde hair. My eyes crinkle at the edges when I smile. I paint my nails when I'm bored. When I'm sad, I find somewhere to be alone and sing to myself. I just want to be happy. I want to get that little boy out of my head. I'm just so tired of feeling sad for him. I feel like it's my fault. Like if I had done something, been a better girl or something, my dad wouldn't have gotten ahold of that picture.

You still weren't sure about how you felt with being with another guy anyway, so that was okay. But still you were a good friend. Even if our tension was something that certainly kept me up at night

When you left for military service for a couple months, I was single but I was also diagnosed with HIV and any chance at us ever being together was blown out of the water. And that's fine. And then you came back and went for a girl who was truly an excellent match for you. And that's also fine. I even pushed her to consider your courtship of her. And still you were a good friend to me. But I was too busy mourning what we'd never be instead of seeing that.

When I grew depressed as I dealt with many things in my life falling apart, from the aforementioned HIV diagnosis to struggling with unemployment to moving back in with my parents, you wouldn't let me give up. I found strength of character in myself to carry on that I had never known. And I actually ~resented~ it. I wanted so very badly to disengage from the world and to shut off. And still you wouldn't let me.  You browbeat me, argued with me and comforted me so that I would stay in the world. You amplified that strength of character I found in myself. I think I resented you a little for that. You were just being a good friend and all I could do was resent you.

And now I'm back in the world again. I am feeling and seeing and even learning to love again. I'm back on my feet and things are actually looking up for me (even if I am skeptical of it, but those trust issues are for another post) and you are still by my side. And I can feel you grow less important in my thoughts. You are still compelling, but not persistent. And that saddens me. Because polite, superficial friendliness is all I can muster for you nowadays. Despite everything you've done for me and we've been through, that's all I can give you.

I'm a 27 year old male and a disabled veteran.  For some reason this incident popped in my head a few days ago and I haven't been able to get rid of it.  I hadn't thought about it much since I was a kid, I didn't understand what was happening at the time and by the time I was old enough to know what happened my Dad was dying of leukemia so I just kind of forgot about it.  But these last few days it's been bothering me and I can't talk to anyone about it.  My wife was abused as a kid but I don't want to burden her about it.  My brother hanged himself last year so I can't talk to him about it.  My cousin is still in the family and is very close to my mother so I can't talk to my mother about it.

About all I can do is talk to my dog about it.

My cousin lived two houses from me.  She is three years older than me while my little brother was 3 years younger than me.  She was one of three siblings and was the most responsible one, so my Mom would have her babysit us since she had just divorced my Dad and wasn't around all the time.  She did a good enough job, treating us with sort of a mild neglect.  She would do her thing like talk on the phone or do her homework and my brother and I would play videogames or whatever.

But when I was 10or 11 things got a little weird.  One evening, my cousin suggested we have a strip show.  Obviously my little brother and I were way too young to know what that was so she explained it.  One of us would step into my bed room and get naked then wrap a towel around ourselves, then come into my brother's bedroom where the others would be sitting in the floor.  Then the stripper would get up on the bed and dance, removing the towel.

It seemed fun, I guess, so we did it.  I don't remember who went first, but each of us did it.  My brother and I giggled from embarassment but we danced.  I hadn't hit puberty and wasn't feeling *those* kinds of feelings yet, but I kept wanting to look at her crotch because I'd never seen that part of a girl before and I was genuinely curious.  She had pubic hair and I had no idea yet that hair grew down there on men OR women.  When she'd catch me staring at her crotch she'd say my name, as if to scold me, and get my attention to her upper body.

This went on for a while.  When she would babysit us, we would play our strip show game.  One night, she thought of another thing we could try.  She wanted us to all get naked and take turns laying on top of her.  She laid a blanket on her body and my brother or I would get on top of her for a minute or so.  The next time, it was a towel instead of a blanket.  She told me that she and her brother had done it without anything in between, sort of daring me to do that, so I did.  

So for a while we would have our strip show game and then get naked and lay on her.  

One day my brother and I were at her house and she was the only one there.  I think she was babysitting us at her house, which was usually fun because they had more NES games and movie channels.  She called us back to her bedroom.  When we got back there she was naked laying on her bed.  She had always referred to her vagina as her ""pocket"".  During our strip games, she'd chastise me for looking at her ""pocket"".  That night, she wanted to try something else.  Wouldn't it be fun if we stuck our wieners in her pocket?  She and her brother did it, after all, and it was a lot of fun!  My brother and I were both grossed out but she kept on it, daring us and calling us chickens.  So I took my pants off and walked over to her.  She spread her pocket open with her fingers.  I took my little prepubescent wiener in my hand and guided it to her pocket.  I hadn't hit puberty and had never had an erection before so it didn't really go in, it just sort of bumped into it.

""Keep trying, you can get it in here!  Don't be a chicken!""  So I kept fiddling with it trying to get it in there.  At some point my foreskin got pulled back and the exposed head of my penis kind of got in there a little bit.  If you're intact you know how sensitive it is, and can imagine how this would feel to a little kid.  It was like I had stuck my penis in a fire.  I jumped back and laughed and said ""It's hot in there!""  and started getting my pants back on.  My cousin made fun of me and told me to try again, but I didn't want to.  It hurt when I did it the first time and wasn't fun at all.  She tried to get my little brother to do it but he wouldn't give it a shot.

I don't know why but after that incident we never had our strip games again.  We never got naked and laid on her, she never asked us to do anything with her pocket.  I didn't tell my Mom because I didn't want to get in trouble, and I was very sure we WOULD be in trouble if she found out.  My cousin continued to babysit us for a few more years until I was old enough to watch after my little brother.  We have never mentioned it to each other ever again.  Now she lives next door to me and has 2 kids and is really close to my mother.  My wife and I don't have any kids so my cousin's kids are sort of like acting grandparents for my mother.

I'm not sure what coming out about it would do anyway.  Who would believe me?  The other witness is dead.  Besides, I was a boy and my cousin was a girl, and girls don't sexually abuse girls.  If I had come out about it as a kid, I would have no doubt been called a liar and have been accused of trying to ruin my cousin's life or something.  There's nothing I could have done and nothing I can do now.

These events and the feelings that (I believe) stem from said events are extremely uncomfortable topics of discussion for me. I don’t want to look like I want sympathy. In fact, that’s the reason why I stopped going to counseling after about four weeks of sessions. All I got were sympathetic looks and a “that must be really hard” every so often. Plus I hate the feeling of crying in front of someone (especially since I’m a male).
	Here are some events from early on in my life that I believe have had some impact on how I feel today:

1.	When I was six, my parents started getting into heated arguments. My mother supposedly caught my dad cheating, and my dad suspected that my mom was having an affair. My mom had a male friend who would take us out fishing from time to time, but I wasn’t allowed to talk about him. I remember lying next to her in bed watching TV and crying my eyes out when she instructed me not to tell my dad, because if I told then I would never see her again and have to live with my dad. At this time, we had Direct TV satellite and my father had a subscription to the “adult” channels. I discovered the Playboy channel (channel 143) when I was 6.

2.	A year later, at the age of 7, I was caught. After school one day, I rushed upstairs as soon as I got home. I had been watching the Playboy channel every day for about a year without anyone knowing about it. But this time I heard footsteps and I froze. My mom barged in, and she saw what I was watching. Then I was spanked extremely hard. With tears running down my eyes, I pleaded that I’d never eat or sleep again and I would never watch the Playboy channel. I ran to my bedroom to hide under my bed, but I was pulled out from under it to have my bare ass spanked again. The last thing I remember from this event was feeling so stressed that I dragged my fingernails down my cheeks and left lines of cuts on my face (thankfully they healed completely).

3.	By the age of 12 my mom had left the house and it was just my dad and me. I had gained weight since I had been sidelined by a knee injury I had when I was 10. You can imagine the names I was being called in middle school on a daily basis. This was where I had my first murder fantasy. I’d think about a kid calling me a “fat ass” and then stabbing him in the windpipe with a pencil. At home, I could tell my dad was conditioning me to dislike my mother by enabling me to blame her for everything that was wrong. He’d say I was gaining weight because I didn’t have a mother to cook healthy meals at home, and therefore I’d have to eat junk at restaurants. During my summer break of that year I had to wake up around 7AM to go to my dad’s workplace (the dental office) because my mother wasn’t home to protect me. From this point forward my dad would always find a way to tell me that my mother “abandoned” me.

4.	November 16, 2006: the day I began actually hating my dad as a person. I had a science project due, and I thought I had finished it the day before. Turns out that I didn’t save my last two paragraphs of the essay and I suddenly forgot how to copy a PowerPoint onto a CD. This was in the 8th grade and I was 14 at this time. I was trying to re-do my work the day before at 7:00 A.M., right as my dad was logging his lard-ass downstairs. He asked me why I was shaking and I started to cry. Then it got worse. The motherfucker mocked me. He kept calling me a “titty baby” over and over, from the time I was in the house till I was dropped off at the middle school. It was the most mortifying experience of my life. I will never forgive him for his despicable actions. Today I relish in causing him emotional pain by ignoring his phone calls and spending as little time possible with him. I see him as an object that I exploit for its financial resources.

5.	Honorable mentions: Dad forced me to go to church with him from the age of 6 to 19 (waking up at 7:25 A.M. for the 8:30 A.M. service); friends manipulated me and I didn’t care (until recently – I decided to get rid of them by ignoring them altogether); Mom attempted suicide; earlier this year a guy who manipulated me into buying weed for him every day and picking him up from his work that was 30 minutes away sexually assaulted me (forcing his mouth on my penis and sucking on it for 5 seconds before I managed to get up and run).

Those are things that I think have shaped me psychologically. In a similar fashion to the events, I will list my fears and stressors.

1.	Body image: Every time I see a mirror, I have to look into it. First I observe my overall build, and then I look into details (chest, shoulders, stomach, face). I lost forty pounds in the 9th grade, and I’ve been obsessed with diet and exercise ever since. My body isn’t where I want it to be, partly because of conflicting priorities (e.g. I want to gain muscle so I lift, but I don’t want to get fat so I limit my diet.). Now my biggest fear is losing my hair and rotting my teeth. I run my tongue around my teeth to see if I need to brush and I run my fingers through my hair because I want to reassure myself that my stress isn’t going to make me go bald. I don’t want to be an unattractive bald man with yellow teeth.
2.	Pornography and dating: I watch porn about 3-4 times a day and I’ve gone without sleep on some nights by alternating between online porn sessions and browsing the rest of the Internet. I’ve never had a girlfriend. It’s not because I am unattractive, as I have had sex with a couple of girls I barely knew. Sometimes I like to engage in “cyber sex”. In real life, I blush very easily and that keeps me from approaching. Also, I feel like I am not ready to deal with the reality of being cheated on. I still obsess over a girl I had a crush on in high school, and I still look through her Facebook pictures and I try to spot her car when I’m driving through town. I always think about how I can explain myself for my awkward conduct with her, and sometimes I’ll be alone and talk to her in my head.
3.	My future: There isn’t a day that goes by without the feeling that I am hanging by a thread. It’s always something. There will always be a deadline with a bunch of errands leading up to it. It never ends. Right now I’m doing well in my sophomore year of college but I’m unsure of my job security and debt after I graduate. I feel like my own death is a deadline of its own. Because one day, I will have to face consequences that will be too harsh for me to bear. Occasionally I’ll watch the Budd Dwyer suicide video in order to get myself comfortable with the idea of pulling the trigger when there’s a gun in my mouth. It’s not so much a choice as it is a necessity. I have made a pact with myself- if I am not financially stable with a healthy sex life by the time I’m 38, I will employ two different methods of suicide at once: 1. Large dose of drugs (possibly a cyanide pill if I can get my hands on it) 2. Handgun in my mouth. I’d make it foolproof by shooting myself as I’m falling backwards into a river. The last thing I’d want is an unsuccessful suicide attempt.

There is much more I could put down here but I feel like I have written too much as it is. I would like actual advice and not something I’d hear from an armchair hack therapist. I want to rid myself of this constant feeling of discomfort and begin looking forward to waking up every day.

After I broke up with my first Gf at 14, I don't quite remember how but I ended up masturbating to the thought of her and her Dad together. I remember thinking how weird and fucked up it was to think that and yet not a week later I was at it again. 

Fast forward to today, I've been with my SO for almost three years. She's everything to me, I plan to propose soon. And yet, not six months ago we almost split after she admitted having feelings for someone she went to Uni with, and though she tells me she doesn't want to talk to him anymore a month or so ago I couldn't help myself looking through her phone. I found him asking almost weekly for them to hang out or her to go to his place, but the real kicker was finding six or seven sexts from him to her about what he wants to do to her, and while she didn't sext back, after every sext she replied ""Go on"" and then ended with ""Well I must admit you had me hooked :P"".

And now I'm back to the weird-masturbating, only now its thoughts of her with him, her with him and other guys at the same time. Thinking of them together both repulses me and turns me on and I feel so fucked about it.

Not to mention I've recently embraced my athiesm, and yet I've had many a night lying in bed being scared as fuck of death. I've got a crappy desk job, shit grades, not many real future prospects. I desperately wish I had someone I could talk to about all of this, about life and death and religion and my fucked up thoughts. I'm too scared to tell it to my SO lest I scare her away.

I met and had a few girls in my first year but non of them where really that important. Starting my second year, I met a girl and we started sleeping together every night fairly quickly. It wasn't an issue for me since I had slept with girls the year before but she had never slept or had sex with a guy so she was a little cautious at first. We really hit it off and soon we were sleeping together every night and honestly it was the best time of my life. I really enjoyed practically living with her. I'd go to class and come back and she'd be there in my apartment. Anyway, the relationship remained pretty casual despite it being more elaborate than any other relationship I had. I myself saw other women and she was aware. She never really saw any other men even though I encouraged her to out of guilt of my blatant disregard for her desire to be exclusive.

I changed my career choice in my second year and decided that it was best that I move back to my home town and study there. This, of course, meant that I had to move back in with my parents. We ended the relationship along with the semester and we left each other on a pretty good note but decided not to stay in touch mostly out of her choice. It hurt a bit but I was a bit excited to go back to my home town. 

I got a job that summer as a brand employee for a mayor retailer which meant most of my shifts started at 5am. I also started studying again in August with 5 classes in the semester. My schedule was pretty tight and my days off were pretty much done for. I really tried to schedule my sleep so that I could get a good night sleep every day before work or class but that's when I realized I couldn't sleep without a girl. I would go entire weeks just lying in my bed awake suffering from being morbidly tired yet I couldn't fall asleep. After passing out at work and crashing from dozing off while driving, i started taking medicine for sleep but this only made it worse because I started passing out regularly especially in the middle of the day. I asked a good friend to sleep with me and keep it asexual, just business but between living with my parents and her own life, we just couldn't keep it up. So here I am, a year after leaving her behind and I still can't sleep alone. I've been hospitalized three times this year and my health has deteriorated severly. I've lost a lot of weight and my general complexion is terrible. I've been trying really hard to find another girl to sleep with but most girls in this town live with their parents and so do I so we have nowhere to sleep together.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_1djdpk,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1djdpk/i_cant_sleep_by_myself/,

I was fine with it for a while, until I found him saving photos of them on his phone, saw inappropriate texts and - the final straw - he answered the phone to one of them mid-coitus. One of the chicks (I'll call her Liana) at this time, was cheating on her bf. The other one (Lily) HAD cheated on her defacto with my bf for a good part of a year, before I was in the picture.

So I did what any crazy, obsessive girlfriend would do.

I work for a phone company. I swapped Liana's phone number onto a SIM card that I had in my possession, and put it in my phone. To my surprise, the first message that came through was from her boyfriend, next one was a picture of a box of condoms from the other-guy, and followed up with a really dirty message. So - I messaged the boyfriend, and told him that I was so sorry, but I'd been cheating on him for the past 6 months, and here was the guys number. Then I messaged the other guy, and told him I'd confessed to my boyfriend, and that we were over.

The day after, I tell my own bf that I won't be staying with him if he continues contacting this chick, and if he wasn't going to tell her I would. So he tells her via email, and she sends  a few hysterical texts, because her life has fallen apart. That's the last I heard from her.

Lily was a different story. I had worked with her, and she'd know if I were to pull any shit like that. Instead, I just told her to back off, and she complied. I wasn't satisfied, but I decided to let that one go. One day her partner messaged me, which was awesome for me, asking me what transpired between her and my bf because he'd seen the emails between us. I told him the full story, not leaving out one detail, and left her to it. He, her partner of 6 years, left her overnight. She has, ever since, told a few people I ruined her life - but cannot explain how and instead just says she hates me, as she doesn't want anyone to know she cheated on her SO. 

So they're two of my most bitchy immature stories, which part of me still feels guilty about. I feel most guilty, because I feel like that level of meddling is abnormal and vindictive, yet I know I'd do it again if put in a similar position.

and decided I needed to get a few things off my chest. I would've posted there but it seems it has been archived and I can no longer reply there. 

1. When I was young, around 9 probably, I was over at a family friend's house. I really wanted to be in with the cool kids so I was trying to hang out with my older brother and his friend. We were all alone in the friends room. They said if I wanted to be there I would need o pretend I am touching myself. They watched my masturbate (sorta) though I was fully clothed. Later the boy had me be sandwiched between my brother and himself. This didn't seem to work as they wanted it to. The boy gave me gum for it. As I was leaving he tried o get his gum back but I refused and ran away. I've always wanted to talk to my brother about it. I never actually held it against him. I hold other things against him, but not that. We come from the same household and I know that we were kids that were pretty oblivious to how the world works. That boy though, is still in the community. Every once in awhile he comes up and other people allude to what a terrible person he is. I will say something like, ""yeah he is horrible, blahblahblah."" My dad doesn't like him either but once the boy had come up and he asked me why I felt so strongly about it. I couldn't bring myself to tell him because it would hurt my brother. I know my brother must feel horrible about it. But I can't talk to him about it. 

2. I dated a boy about 2 years ago right after I'd gotten out of a serious relationship. He was extremely aggressive sexually from the start, and I'm not sure why, it probably had something to do with my complete lack of self worth, I allowed anything to happen with this guy. He made me feel bad about myself, I barely spoke to him during our entire relationship. We dated for about 7 months. He wold push me aainst walls, throw me into bed, in the street he would take advantage. I would have bruises. He would yell at me if I didn't do things the way he wanted. He raped me, multiple times. He made me feel incredibly guilty if I wasn't in the mood at the moment. I was completely broken and still fear him. It eventually ended because I kissed someone else and he found out. I still miss him and would've loved to meet him at this ""healthier"" time of my life. I feel most guilty about that. 

3. I think about killing myself pretty often. I honestly believe that my life has no bearing in this world. I think I'm a horrible screw up and I will never get myself together. All of my efforts go to trying to better myself but I never seem to get anywhere. I don't have a good job. I think I am an intelligent person and I work hard but I am leagues behind everyone else in the ""where I should be"" category when it comes to my career. Nobody understands why I try to take care of certain people or why I try to be understanding. I see it holding me back and a lot of people tell me how bad it is for me. Even in the above examples I try to help these people to the best of my abilities. I take on a considerable amount of responsibility for my brother so his life can be easier and manageable. My life is not manageable, but I don't know how to help myself. I have no money, and need a direction. I largely, and probably wrongly, blame my parents for what is wrong with me. They don't really have their lives together either. There are so many factors that keep me from being someone memorable in my mind. I don't think I will ever be happy. I do not believe that is possible. And if that is not possible I would rather die. I often think about walking to the bridge in the bitter cold and fog and jumping off and how little time t would take for people to move on.   It keeps me alive to think that someday that might change, but realistically I know it will not. 

That's all. I guess I just had to say that. 

TLDR; 1. I was sorta molested by a family friend, 2. I was raped and abused by my bf who I still want to be with 3. I want to die. ",,False,,t5_2qq6g,1365305981.0,,,True,t3_1bu1i7,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1bu1i7/my_darkest_secrets/,

Reason number 1: He convinced me to have a threesome with my best friend. Was in love with him and wanted to make him happy. He couldn't get hard during act for some reason, so we ended it early. Slept in the bed together. I left for work in the morning and they ended up having sex. He said it was because he didn't want to look stupid and incompetent since he couldn't get it up the night before. For some reason I forgave and forgot.

Reason number 2: He started texting inappropriate things to my other best friend, about what she likes in bed, if she ever thinks about kissing me, etc. Found texts on his phone, but of course that was my fault because I was invading his privacy.

Reason number 3: A year into our engagement he told me he has sexual fantasies about Best Friend #1. He said it had nothing to do with me since our sex life was great, but he said he ""needed"" to get it off his chest. I think it was his way of subtly  wanting to have another threeway. I slept at a friend's house and almost ended the relationship but he cried and begged me to stay.

Reason number 4: A week before our wedding he has his bachelor party, where his friend's make him go to a strip club. Which is fine, go look, whatever, doesn't bother me. But a few days before our wedding I finally see him without a shirt on (he had managed to keep one on while he slept which he usually doesn't and when I questioned him on it, he said he was just cold) his chest was covered in hickeys. He told me the stripper kept biting him even though he told her he was engaged and about to be married. I don't think I believe him, but I'm better at sweeping things under the rug and ignoring problems so I let it go.

Every once in a while I think of all these things and probably more that I forgot for the moment, and just get really sad. We're married now and happy most of the time, but somewhere in the (almost) decade we've been together I think we have grown apart on an emotional level that we might not get back from. I'm looking into getting therapy soon, and hopefully I can get some form of therapy by sharing this with everyone. I've never told anyone all of the details of how I feel, I think because I know that they will tell him I need to leave him and I've spent so much of my life with him that I don't know how my life would be without him.

I also get really sad when I think about the future and think that we probably will be divorced someday. I don't like thinking that about my own husband, but mostly I just think it's really depressing to know that you won't be with your SO for the rest of your life, like you promised to.

She constantly does her best to make me angry then when i snap she runs and hides behind locked doors and screams or hides behind our mom. I don't hit her, but i would if i could. I'm not normally a violent person. 
She's the kind of person that does her best to be popular and she always makes fun of her friends and calls them fat, ugly, stupid, weird, etc. We're complete opposites. She's short and skinny and blonde and wears UGGs and Abercrombie. I'm average height, average weight, have rainbow hair, my septum is pierced, and i wear band Ts and skinny jeans most of the time. She's cruel and a bully. I get bullied plenty at school, i have depression and i used to self harm. She knows all this but all she ever does is try to enrage me.
I don't love her. You know how you'll say ""i hate my mom"" but on the inside you really love her? I think i really hate my sister. 
i finally snapped. She was egging me on again and i started screaming at her about how much of a terrible person she is and how i genuinely hate her. I saw her face break.

1376573179.0,26,self.confessions,1kf0f1,I'm ashamed of my budding sexuality,abcd626,37,11,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kf0f1/im_ashamed_of_my_budding_sexuality/,"Just like my title says, I'm ashamed of my sexual feelings, needs, desires and orientation. I don't even know why. I just feel this incredible need to be ashamed of everything sexual I do. 

I was raised Catholic in a low-middle income family with mild aversion to sexual topics. My parents are always making sexual jokes and they don't mind if we laugh, they actually encourage it sometimes. From the age of 14, my parents have been open about sex and have often offered to buy me condoms or birth control if need be (although they have stated that they wish I didn't but they rather have me safe than sorry). My mother has told me that she stayed a virgin until she met my dad (they had me before they were married). My dad is very open about his past girlfriends. In all, they don't shame sex but they are very open about their belief that sex will only lead me to pregnancy which will lead me to poverty and unhappiness. I'm not sure if this has fueled my shame over my sexuality but I do think it has helped it a bit. 

From the time I was 12, I have been so obsessed with sex because I didn't understand how it worked but the crazy thing is, I couldn't get myself to watch heterosexual porn, I could only watch lesbian porn. I was so incredibly ashamed of that, I would even lie to myself about it.  I would convince myself that I wasn't turned on by the lesbian porn, I was just getting weird feelings because I was straight. From then on, I  wanted to watch lesbian porn or look at pictures because I was so turned on by two women getting off with one another. I tried to ignore my feelings and what they meant because being a lesbian wasn't a possibility to me. I liked men and believe me, I knew I wanted sex with men because they turned me on just like women did.

When I was 14, i tried to masturbate but I felt so dirty and wrong. I felt like I should only orgasm when a man did it for me. I don't even know where I got this idea from because no one has ever told me this and i have never had a discussion about it. It didn't feel right to me to give myself this pleasure when ""a man"" should be the one granting me this pleasure. 

At 16, I tried to masturbate again but I couldn't. I tried rubbing myself and even though I had literally soaked through my panties and had been trying for 30 minutes, I couldn't get any pleasure from it. I was so frustrated because I desperately wanted this but I felt like my mind and body were betraying me. 

At 17, I came across a tumblr blog about female masturbation. It made me a little bit more comfortable about masturbating. I learned about pillow humping and decided to try it out. It didn't do anything for me and again, I was frustrated. I tried rubbing with no luck either. I didn't even try fingering myself because I felt that I shouldn't do that because it was a man's role to finger/place himself inside of me. Again, no one has ever told me this or has ever discussed it with me so I can't quite understand why I feel this way about my body. 

no matter where I touched myself, I couldn't feel anything. Then sometime(after I turned 18) in July, I was so horny after watching lesbian porn and looking at lesbian sex gifs/picstures on tumblr, I decided to try masturbating again. I started off slow, rubbing my nipples and getting them hard and then slowly, rubbing myself. It started to hurt, a good kind of pain. It was like small fireworks of pain were exploding out of myself from that small area. I needed more ""fuel"" to get me hornier (cheesy way of saying it, but i think you get the idea) so while scrolling through tumblr, I found a blog of a guy who had recordings of himself getting off. I listened to it and honestly, my masturbating got even better. I was thrusting into my fingers and i felt these spasms in my thighs and it felt so wonderful. I could feel an impending orgasm and I stopped myself. Its like my body and mind refused to let me orgasm. I couldn't get myself to reach the edge and I have never been so frustrated. My body just refused to do it. I rubbed myself on pillows and folded up blankets, feeling small spams of good pain until my frustration went away but I was so ashamed of myself. I couldn't understand why I wanted to give myself an orgasm.

And through all of this frustration, I’ve discovered that I’m turned on by male-male porn. I like the idea of two men having sex, It turns me on and make me incredibly wet. I don’t understand myself. I don’t understand why I can’t bring myself to orgasm and why I’m so turned on gay/lesbian porn. The thought of having anal sex thrills me. I want to have anal sex and be rimmed and fingered anally. I want it just as much as I want vaginal sex and that scares me.

I’m confessing this because my inability to bring myself to orgasm has stopped from developing relationships with others. I’m worried that my obsession with not getting myself off will be apparent to my partner and they will laugh at my sexual shame. I want to be comfortable with my sexual needs. Whenever I find someone who wants to be in a relationship with me, I stop it from happening because I feel like my sexual inabilities will be so obvious that they will see that I am not good enough. I’m afraid that people will view my obsession with sex as weird and freaky and not want to have sex or have anything to do with me. I feel that if people know about the things that turn me, they will shun me and call me a freak. I’m so ashamed of myself and I don’t know what to do. 

I feel like my sexual desires are not okay. I’m an 18-year old university freshman young woman who is so ashamed of my sexual needs and desires that I stop myself from developing healthy romantic relationships. I don’t know what to do anymore.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_1kf0f1,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kf0f1/im_ashamed_of_my_budding_sexuality/,

I can’t help but think that she deserves to be by my side on this great adventure. I remember the struggle we went through and that she stayed by me through incredible hardship. Now that I’ve found success, I want her to be here to enjoy it with me. I want to look over and see the smile on her face as we listen to wind blow through the trees on an afternoon stroll. I want to race a few paces ahead to pick a flower for her hair. But, when my imagination gives in and reality sets in, I look over to the empty wooden bench or vacant sidewalk and she slips away from me all over again.

Each year her birthday passes and I count them without a means to send her my best wishes. I feel each year weigh on my heart. A year lost. Something priceless. It can never be returned to us. I fear that we’ll meet our graves with decades of time lost this way, perhaps thousands of miles apart.

We are both older, over 30, own a home together, and get along fantastically; she really gets me and I often am reminded and shocked at how cool she is. In short, I love my girlfriend very much, and I am so glad that we are together, but I want to have sex with a variety of women. 

Women are so beautiful, both outside and inside. Sure, some women are unpleasant, just like some men are unpleasant, but all in all, I like talking to women, I like listening to them, I like looking at them, I like flirting, and I like the feeling of being intimate with someone for the first time. 

I tend to think of sex in evolutionary terms: humans are supposed to be polyamorous so *why would I NOT want to have sex with other women?* I want to see them all naked, to have a flash of passion with them, and for them to have a flash of passion for me. Back in the primitive days (10,000+ years ago) it was a general free-for-all (gross oversimplification but point remains). It is how the diversity of the species is maintained. To sum up Bullworth ""everybody just needs to keep fucking everybody else until we all turn the same color"" or something like that. And I want in. I want to taste all flavors which want to be tasted. 

I've never cheated on my girlfriend, and I don't plan to. And I know that what may seem like a great, can't-go-wrong open-sex fantasy (an open relationship) usually ends up being a clusterfuck and is never that simple. But still, the longing for ""strange"" is strong in this one. I can't seem to get over it. The longer we are together and more committed to my girlfriend I become the stronger this urge gets. It's not that I want to see what else is out there as far as a long-term relationship, it's I just want the freedom to have sex with any woman who would like to have sex with me. 

And no, the girlfriend is not into open stuff. Any cheating, no matter the circumstances, I'm history, even if she loves me. So very little wiggle-room on that. 

I know I am not unique in this but it is the first time I am struggling with it because I am with the woman I'll die with, so that's why.

He would lick her vagina and I would lick her ass hole and vice versa, we would take turns putting our dicks in her mouth. If my dick was in her mouth, he would probably be licking her out or his dick would be in mine and vice versa.

1343941717.0,26,self.confessions,xl1mc,I present the world with a fake version of me and I have a few things to get off my chest,confessedthrowaway20,32,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/xl1mc/i_present_the_world_with_a_fake_version_of_me_and/,"tl;dr: i play a character in real life and don't let anyone know me, then i secretly resent people for not figuring it out

I'm a 37 year old single man with a solid career. No one really knows me. I grew up in a small coastal village in a loving family. I had a great childhood and love my parents and siblings. 

I've lived abroad for a while before coming back to the US to start a real life. I've had a lot of adventures and misadventures, been in a number of fantastic situations that I'm not even going to bother to ask you to believe. I've loved and lost, and worked as everything from a carpenter to an IT infrastructure manager in a major corporation to a contractor in a CDC lad to a contractor technician in rad/decon for a few branches of government. I have a background in the sciences and information technology. 

I never felt particularly connected to people. I never understood the standard ""get married, buy house, have kids"" paradigm. I never cared about pop culture. I don't care about sports, tv, celebrities or any of the other things that so many people invest themselves in, instead feeling such things are meaningless and hollow. 

I spend all of my time building things. I build extensively in several virtual worlds ranging from Second Life to OpenSim. I create and sell wiremesh models on several independent online marketplaces. I have a carpentry workshop that no one I know is aware of where I build furniture and the such, donating much of it to Good Will anonymously.

I live on what I will call a ""facility"" on the outskirts of a village. This facility was at one time a machine shop and consists of two connected structures and an out-building. The first half of this structure, which was originally a workshop and later offices, I converted into living space with a floorplan something like a loft. It is connected to as rectangular structure that was a machine shop, which I have converted into a workshop and computer lab, with a dividing wall between these two functional spaces. I use the outbuilding as a studio. The road leading to my facility isn't paved. I have no neighbors and do not want any. Mail isn't even delivered here, I go to town to pick it up twice a month.

I have ""friends"". I do the bare minimum to maintain those relationships. Where these friends are interested in doing normal people things such as dining out, going to concerts, watching movies, etc, I have no interest in those things and go to just enough to maintain those relationships. Instead I'll go to my lab or my workshop and spend my time in solitude producing things. 

I prefer to be alone. I prefer solitude and perceive liberty in that solitude. My one wish in life is to be left alone to pursue my own ends. 

I wear a mask. I allow no one to see the real me. I isolate my social groups, never introducing one group of friends to another or friends to family as I believe that in so doing, it would create an unnecessary level of social complexity on my life. 

To maintain relationships, I make sure I am always there when a friend or family member needs help in any form. This has lead me to driving hundreds of miles to pick someone up, spending countless hours providing free contracting ranging from carpentry and construction to painting and spackling, fixing or building PC's for people, providing free ""tech support"", etc. I have bailed friends out of trouble, provided temporary lodging, driven people all over the place, lent them money, fed them, helped them with advice, checked in on them when they needed someone to stand by them. 

The mask that I show these people is a mask with opinions and tastes that are similar to my friends. I've sat through countless football and baseball games quietly suffering while pretending I was vaguely interested in what was happening on the screen. At least there's usually beer. 

Behind my mask, I feel no attachment to these people. Should one fade out of my life, I would feel no remorse or sorrow. Instead I might feel some annoyance over having to find a replacement. 

So while I've stated all of this, I've come to terms with some quirks I've noticed about myself:

1. I secret am a little resentful that these people haven't seen through my facade

2. I am resentful of some of these friends in particular, including a couple I'm friends with where the husband is a computer system analyst yet his wife has to call me for tech support while he sits on the sofa and does nothing

3. I have no idea why I am like this. I have suffered no childhood trauma's, have never been abused by anyone, and have never been betrayed

4. Despite not being able to explain myself, I have no interest in letting people know the real me

Additionally, I remain completely in the dark as to why so many people invest so much of their time in distractions instead of setting goals and accomplishing them. I fail to see any value in the following:

1. Sitting in front of a tv watching nonsense for hours on end

2. Investing time and money in narcotics instead of investing those resources in building something

3. Creating unnecessary drama and apparently thriving on it

4. Investing time in hurting and demeaning other people simply because they are a little different or have different views and values

5. The apparent overwhelming desire that so many have their needs fulfilled by goverment AND the apparent joy that so many other people seem to have at the idea of curbing the good social programs that give needy people some much needed food.

Humanity confuses me. I do not understand people, have no patience for people who dislike other people for any reason other than the quality of their character, and simply cannot bring myself to respect people who flock to the hivemind mentality despite however the hivemind's opninions and values align with their own. 

I also concede that I am a monster and am open to the possibility that this fact is what leads the real me to live on the fringe of society.

I masturbate daily, sometimes multiple times daily. I think about sex for hours and hours every day. It's insane, and makes me think there's something wrong with me, honestly. 

Sometimes I like to go out and just walk around, looking around for people I'd fuck. I'm never very lucky. I do get hit on, but usually by creepers and although I'm horny, if I suspect rape is on the menu, I'm out.

My partner and I have an open relationship and sleep with other people.

Honestly, I see it as killing two birds with one stone. I think the only things stopping me are the legal and safety aspects. I wish I could do a private thing with a few select people that I knew were clean and safe and discreet. I don't think I'll be so lucky.

Also, I think even considering the open status of our relationship, doing this would be a pretty dick move on my part. I feel like I'd be disrespecting my partner. That said, if he said he was cool with it, I would be too.

I dunno. I feel so strange. I don't think it's normal to be thinking about sex this often.

I have slept with some of my friends. I have not slept with any of his friends, but there are quite a few that I would *love* to get the chance to. I would only be okay with that if he were. I'd never bring it up though. I'm pretty sure most guys have a code about this sort of thing. 

Anyway, I feel a little better having gotten that out. I don't know what to make of this. I feel I should add that my sex life has diminished in the last few months due to a relocation for work. Aside from a few co-workers, I don't know anyone in the area yet.

I'm a bit sad to be posting here as I feel my life is spinning totally out of my control, but I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

My gf and I had only been going out (off and on) for about a year and I was never that serious with her - each of us had gone on dates with others that we both knew about. We decided to move in together as a matter of convenience as much as anything else (both leases ending, it was cheaper, we were very compatible living together and neither knew any friends who would be good flatmates at the time), but she knew I wasn't ready for anything permanent like marriage, and I didn't get the impression she was either. The one thing I did suspect that she was into me more than I was into her, but it was never really obvious.

She is a very sexy woman and we had lots of sexy times, but she was going to move away within a year as her work visa in the country was ending. I was clear anytime family came up that I wasn't ready for one, I didn't give signals that I wanted anything permanent with her, and in any event we both knew it would be difficult if not impossible in our circumstances to have children with my job being phased out in a year (and still big student loan debts to repay) and her obligated to leave the country. So for that reason and the fact that I never thought of her as ""the one"" I was always conscious of birth control. Both of us preferred sex without condoms and I eventually gave those up (mistake #1) but she was on the pill, so I figured the chances of pregnancy were pretty low. Boy was I wrong.

One bright morning in bed she told me she was pregnant. I was floored. I knew the chance of getting pregnant on the pill was less than 1%, so I asked her how it could be. She admitted she had not been careful about taking her pills - like forgetting to take any for a week or more at a time. I just couldn't see how someone so smart and normally well-organized could forget something like that for so long, but she denied doing it on purpose. 

She asked me what I thought we should do. I told her I wasn't ready to be a dad, and besides it would be extremely difficult to have a baby with her forced to leave the country in a matter of months. She said she was keeping the baby no matter what... and again asked what I planned to do. It seemed to me to be like a some kind of test, with her starting at me so intently when she asked the same question time &amp; again over the next days. And I felt that this was all more about what I was going to do rather than her, because it seemed like she had already made up her mind.

(Time out: Some of you might say that she may have gotten pregnant on purpose to get into the country, but I'm pretty sure that's not it... she is well off, extremely well-educated with a very good job (she is a highly paid medical professional) and could go to live, work, or immigrate to just about any country she wants. In fact she had worked in a few countries in Europe for international organizations before we even met)

But back to the difficult choice. I kind of felt like I was being taken biological hostage here. But it's not the baby's fault, and I know how bad it often is for children to grow up without a dad. So what are my moral obligations?

What would you do if you were me: stick with her (get married?) and be a parent to the child, or leave on your own path for a life you can live on your own terms?",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_vo470,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/vo470/gf_went_off_pill_got_pregnant_kept_the_baby_all/,

I have confessing to do. The confessing is regarding the feelings of self-hatred and sadness that I have tried very hard to supress these past few months at my new job.

These feelings came back to the surface the other night because I went on Omegle. Not a single person took me seriously - they all laughed at me. Girls all acted like they had seen a ghost or a murder and clicked to move on as fast as they could. I can understand that they were just teenage girls and I am way older - and believe me it wasn't my intent to chat with them... but they reacted like I was some monster and not a human being.

Now that I am typing this I feel sort of stupid. I mean, girls are teenagers are immature... they are not adults and they don't have adult feelings. And yet still it scarred me quite severely emotionally.

Anyway... our office has a clique. I'm not in it. At first I didn't care, but now... I am so damned lonely. I spend all of my lunches by myself. I don't have any friends. Nobody really cares about me in the slightest. The only thing I have going for me is that I am one of the smartest people in the company when it comes to mathematics and problem solving. 

I am good at chatting with people or emailing. I am very witty and funny and make people laugh - they like me! But then when I talk to them on the phone or meet them in person... I am boring. Then the emails stop coming as well as the text messages. It makes me want to cry... why do I have to be this way? I AM the guy on the email/IM... not the locked-jaw weird guy who says random things that don't even have anything to do with the current conversation. 

I am scared because I have excellent relationships with my work partners across the country, but soon I will need to travel to the corporate office and then people wil lmeet me in person... and I will bore them or act weird and then all of them will not like me anymore.

I almost want to somehow get out of it because it feels good to be liked and valued. I haven't felt that way since grade school - haven't had any friends since then actually. Haven't made any friends certainly.

So ... any advice for me? I know I am feeling sorry for myself but I am really sad. Just sad sad sad all the time... I can't really help it. It is who I am ... a sad, strange old man.

Please let me at least get promoted to a respectable rank so I can at least tell people I am someone important. that would make me feel more valuable as a person. As it is... I feel like a complete and total loser.

Or, well, I'm not at all good. I was, until a couple of hours ago.

I'll allow myself to start from the beginning: my ex-girlfriend and I broke up about half a year ago. It was mutual, and we tried staying friends after. Of course, I'm a dickhead, and I get extremely territorial about the people I love, so in the end, being friends didn't work out either. So I did the only logical thing: pushed myself out there again. Started dating, flirting, hooking up, and all the other great things about being young. I started feeling better. My mood improved, I could function socially again, and I even got myself a female acquaintance, who I'm quite fond of.

Cut to today. I was on a dating site I started using after my ex and I broke up, and I saw a picture of my ex. The photo was very recent, and the second I saw it something happened that I was so not prepared for. The photo was so ""her"" - it just conveyed her entire personality, the personality which I loved extremely; and upon seeing it, I just broke down. My body started aching, my eyes got heavy, and I really just wanted to rip out my lungs so I wouldn't have to worry about breathing. All the previous emotions started flooding my mind, and it occured to me once again what I had lost. 

I have called it off with that other girl because I'm obviously too unstable to handle something like that at this time. This girl and I are still friends - and don't get me wrong, I have great friends, a loving family and at least some options for girlfriends.

I have a best-friend. Let’s call her Gabby.

Gabby and I met on the first day of school and we’ve spent very little time apart since. Even now whilst I’m at university and she works full-time we visit each other as often as we can.

Over the years we’ve shared sleepovers, birthday parties, secrets, make-up, clothes all the stuff typical girlfriends do together. I’m like a second daughter to her parents and vice-versa, forever welcome in each other’s homes. Gabby stayed up all night with me when by now ex-boyfriend hit me, she held me when I cried and was there for me like no other friend I had. I even introduced her to her fiancé.

Gabby has a little brother, Nick. He was always there, sort of in the background, he used to annoy her when we were younger, and follow us about like younger siblings tend to do. I never really paid much attention to him over the years.

But when he was 15 and I was 18 I started to realise that he was developing nicely. I mostly ignored it until one afternoon when I was over their house, he was in his room on his own and I went to borrow a DVD he had that Gabby and I wanted to watch. I realised rather quickly that I had accidentally walked in on him masturbating. I thought it might be best to make light of the situation, it started by me apologising for spoiling his “fun”, I don’t remember the exact details of our conversation but it ended with me tossing him off (hand job?).

I remember trying to catch him in such a situation again, going into his room unannounced; I even flashed him a few times.

I guess it worked because a couple of months later I gave him a blow job and about a year later we had sex, which his girlfriend at the time found out about and dumped him.

Gabby doesn’t know, she doesn’t have a clue, I remember asking her why her brother got dumped and she didn’t even seem interested.

It’s been 3 years and I still really like Nick, we still get together when we can and I really like him, I think he likes me too but I can’t even imagine how I would explain the situation. I don’t want Gabby to find out really, I’m scared that she would never forgive me.

It's even kind of tedious for me to listen to people who are upset at the whole thing because it's like listening to someone go on and on about how you should eat your broccoli because kids starve in Africa.

None of these kids were special.  Not even human life is special- there have been over 100,000,000,000 people so far so to claim someone is special seems kind of ridiculous.

The honest truth is that nothing of value was lost.  Most of these kids would have grown up to do nothing with their lives and the few that *may* have will just be replaced by the other million people who would do that job better.  And as for the teachers... seriously, they're teachers.  There are a thousand people, College Grad to seasoned teacher, who can fill those few spots.

And as for all the ""Well what if it was someone you knew?!"" I keep hearing... that's different.  I recognize that I'm biased and sentimental to the people I'm close with.  I would be destroyed if my mom died, but objectively she's not special.  She was a stay at home mom and after we grew up she took a civil service job.  She's not exceptionally creative, smart, clever.... or anything.  She's absolutely average.  Just because she's special to ""me"" doesn't mean she's ""special"" to everyone.

I really feel that when people try and talk about it, wear a ribbon, or whatever ""in memory"" of these strangers they never ever met... they're being phony.  I can not fathom how people would be genuinely upset over these strangers.  If it were genuine, they'd have so much empathy that they'd be a wreck all day every day.  Because people die all the time and nobody cares.

I googled it just now:  A child dies every 8 seconds.  So the equivalent number of kids dies faster than every three minutes.  All day.  Every day.  And nobody cares.  There's no facebook ""like this if you hate child murder"" posts, no ""everyone wear blue today at school to show support"".

And as for that matter, who are they showing support **to** when they do that?  Themselves?  It's just a circlejerk.

I'm sure any thieves on here would know Black Friday is the best day to steal because of the crowds and lack of caring from the clerks. 

This Black Friday, I left before I wanted to.  This past month I've bonded with a guy (long story) and we steal together, to put it simply. Anyway, he told me all of the stores were open at 8, and when I got dropped off, I discovered none were, except for Sears.  

So we went there.  We basically spent 30 minutes waking around being bored and willing the mall to open, but it didn't.

After a while, we came upon the electronics section. And the glass case that held all of the tablets, gaming stations and ereaders was open (I'm guessing the workers didn't want to unlock and relock it over and over again). I kinda lurked around, and he thought about buying an Xbox for his brother.  Then, I saw it. A kindle fire. 

Little backstory: last year for Christmas, I wanted a kindle. What did I get?  A kobo. Do you know what that is?  No?  Exactly.

Anyway, I had to have it.  So I grabbed it and walked around the store. I ripped off the stickers (which I didn't have to cause sears doesn't have sensors) and ripped it out of the box. Me and my friend went outside and he immediatly asked me to get one for him. So I hid mine in a bush and repeated the process. 

I think that's when I hit bottom. I stole $400 worth if things in 10 minutes.


So I quit.

When I told three managers who were approaching hour two of their break that ""maybe one of you should open a register so she doesn't get attacked by that mob out there"", the fattest, laziest manager said ""I'm not going to do that.  I work too hard to help cashiers."") and yell at the skeleton crews for having such long lines, people would often gripe that even though they worked fulltime hours they weren't classified as fulltime so they could be denied benefits, and so on and so on.

So when a rude customer called my coworker a nigger and the managers fired him for refusing to help him and saying ""Get the hell out you racist asshole."" I was done.

It started slow and small.  I'd steal slices of pizza from the food court (~$3) and sodas (~75cents).  After a while I'd steal huge packs of batteries (~$20) and those Pom pomegranate drinks (~$10) and cookies and brownies (~$2 ea.) and books (~$10) and I'd sneak into the meat department and mislabel pay $1.75/lb for rib-eye steaks (They're about $15/lb).  I'd open cases of power bars and slim jims (~$20) and leave with my pockets full.  I stole packs of disposable razors (~$25) and shirts (~$20).  The biggest thing I ever stole was a few ~$199 external hard drives.

And I only got away with it because the only security guard quit (because the managers were such assholes.  He once ranted to me about how only three of the security cameras actually worked and the rest were fakes) and the GM didn't see fit to replace him for about two years.

And I was by no means the only one who did it- I know of 6 employees who still work there and steal stuff.  Though I think I might have done it the most.

And it was all because the managers were douchebags and their Loss Prevention numbers were tanked by yours truly.  I'm pretty sure I've cost them hundreds, if not thousands in their bonuses.

And I got fired because one day I overslept and showed up two hours late.

And I know they didn't know anything about what I'd done because a women who got caught stealing candy out of an open bag in the returns pile at customer service was fired on the spot.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_wwigj,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/wwigj/i_stole_thousands_of_dollars_worth_of_stuff_from/,

Sometimes the sex is fantastic, sometimes it's terrible, but the rush in the beggining makes up for it. 

As soon as I met my wife, I flat out stopped screwing hookers. I've been with her for two years and recently I've got the itch to back to the streets where the ladies of the night gathered.

Basically it started out with me convincing myself if they changed where they hang out or if there are any new nationalities. And in the beggining I'd just cruise with my car, take a look and to back home. Sometimes I'd jerk off, sometimes not.

Recently I've been getting the same rush, and I feel extremely horny, I'd park in a dark place where I can see them and just jerk off in the car. Occasionally, I'd talk to them from the car, ask how much she charges and where she's from.

I feel so ashamed of myself, I know it technically may not be cheating, but I feel like I have a problem that I need to fix. I'm not worried that I will sleep with any of them because I would never cheat on my wife, I love her dearly and I don't know what to do about it.

I was living halfway across the country and decided to go home after I realized I was really losing it. I began hearing voices. The television would talk to me and I had 3 people at any given time sitting cartoon-anatomy style in chairs in my head telling me to do things and who I could trust. at any given time they were kurt cobain or a boy I had a crush on for years or a guy I used to work with or my long deceased grandfather. I also thought my cat was trying to tell me things. I finally went to live with my mother telling no one anything because even at my most unhinged I recognized that telling anyone would result in at best going to a doctor (which I loath) or getting psychiatric treatment.  I was absolutely convinced there were 3 levels in people comprised of angels and demons and that greek gods from mythology inhabited everyone and were looped through native american folklore in a way I can only barely remember enough to comprehend unless I really tried which I am reluctant to.  Essentially every mythology or folklore I ever read interwove and made a very very detailed web of heightened belief in my head. I was never diagnosed after about a year I was together enough to get a job..for the next few years I still would have conversations with the people in my head and to this day still struggle to disregard what they say.  No one ever tells me to kill anyone or myself and they don't try to warn me that someone else is killing me anymore.  I'm aware thanks to google fu that this is probably some schizophrenia related illness but to be honest I have it under such control now that what I have left I enjoy and I don't want it gone. The most bizarrely comical of it all is that when I wasn't afraid of being assasinated it was actually pretty wonderful.  Feeling connected and powerful and part of something greater thats rooted through the universe.  The part I hold on to the strongest still is this belief that there are really only a handful of types of people in the world (again, based largely in greek mythology...we're talking hestias and perspehones, athena's and zeus and hades etc) and all of them have large contributing factors as to the nature of the person..and it really helps me get a line on people I think.

im a female in her early twenties from a middle class upbringing, supportive family, studying for a law degree, good circle of friends both at home and at university. and in relation to the confession, have slept with 30 people (safely!), enjoyed every experience and discovered my seemingly high (in comparison to friends) sex drive.

I see nothing shameful about consensual safe sex between two adults who are participating for no ones benefit other then their own.

I have a huge deep down urge to be a prostitute/sex worker. 

I'm not stupid enough to mean I want to be beaten daily by a pimp and trapped into selling my body to pay for an addiction. I literally wish I could use how I look to garner attention and lavish pleasure upon men. I understand how strange this is and hard to understand hence me making this on a throwaway, I'm trying to explain and understand this the best I can.

Maybe it's because I don't have a significant other, sometimes feel disconnected from friends and want a man to look at me and want me.  Maybe it's because deep down I want attention from men, though I am told I am good looking.

I honestly don't understand it. If I told family or friends, clearly their reaction would be a stern talking too. Literally I often think of joining an escort agency and fantasize about it.

I probably haven't given enough detail for anyone here to react with anything other then ""...whut?"" or ""go get educated on the real world.""

The very same night I confessed to her, he started texting him about when we would hook up again, and the very next night, I was with him.  I've been with him at least once a week since about the middle of February.  We have dirty, forceful sex and we don't tell anyone.  He slaps me around and hurts me, and I love it.  He likes to sex-text me while I'm with her because the fact that I feel so guilty about it turns him on... and I think it turns me on too.  

I hate him, and I think that also fuels the fire.  I fucking hate him so much...

In times when bad things could happen, like right now when I might fail a class and wouldn't be able to graduate from college until the end of the year (another semester of tuition), I (seriously) pray to god that things work out well. This only happens when I have no real control over what happens, or feel I have no other choice. When I do pray, which isn't often, I feel like a hypocrite on multiple levels. I deny the existence of a god but pray as if one does exist, and I only pray when I need something. When the time of crisis is over, I stop praying and resume denying. When the results I want happen, I don't say it was God, I say it was luck. But in the back of my mind I can't help but think maybe it was more than luck.

This same delivery method was how I found out about my great grandma and my cousin.

When I went to my great grandma's funeral I was 16, and had been out of the church for close to 5 years so I had not seen or spoken to anyone in my family besides my Mom, Dad and sister since then. Everyone was happy to see me since they viewed us leaving as something my Mom had done to me, with me not having any choice. I was very naive at the time and thought it would be just like old times when I asked my uncle if I could catch up with them after the funeral, and he said yes.

So the evening comes and I come over still in my suit (I lived an hour away so I couldn't have just gone home) and my uncle proceeds to subtly hint that I was going to go to hell for various reasons, one for example was when my phone (which was an iPhone) rang. They asked me questions about the iPhone and then he mentioned how they don't put value into earthly goods, even though he had recently sold a ton of farmland and moved to a really nice house. Even though I was really naive I could see what was happening and decided to leave, and he told me to ""have a nice life.""

I was in tears the entire way home because I couldn't believe that someone in my own family could have been so awful to me for no reason. I was so happy to see them and they crushed everything that I remembered in my childhood. 

Just a few months ago I came back from a vacation with my girlfriend to find out that one of my elder cousins who had recently left the church had died from a drug overdose. He had schizophrenia, and in the church they decided that he had demons so nobody would talk to him. Going to the doctor for anything isn't allowed, any medication is off limits. Olive oil and prayer is how things were done when I was growing up there, and it's still the same way. Many people have died from easily treatable conditions.

The only way I'll be able to see my grandpa is if the funeral home will tell me when his viewing is, and I'm not sure if that's something they're allowed to say. I'm hopeful though

Enough rambling, growing up there and having my entire extended family turn their backs on me have really fucked me up. It's hard for me to really express myself to anyone because it's easier to just shut them off and never speak to them again.

Even my best friends have mentioned that I may drink too much.

I have gotten into legal trouble by getting a DUI last summer at the tender age of nineteen. It wasn't my first time driving under the influence but it was definitely the last time I have driven since. Even worse I attend a Christian University in Southern California where I have incidents of being reported for drinking. Since I am under 21 and on contract as an athlete they try to hold me accountable. 

The DUI has cost me almost 8,000 in legal fees, attorney fees and other miscellaneous costs. If I get caught with another alcohol related incident at my school before April 28th I will most likely be kicked out.

Yet despite all of this I cannot for the life of me put the bottle down once I pick it up. My Irish father's mother was an alcoholic and my Korean mother's side is filled with alcoholics - one of her brothers died a few years back of liver failure. I can say no to drinking until I start and from there it all goes down hill.

I didn't start drinking until I was a senior in high school - my parents never kept alcohol around the house nor did they drink and kept me pretty busy between church, school and sports. The first time I drank I did not get drunk, only slightly buzzed but for some reason I decided I did not like it and it was over a month before I started drinking again. I got extremely drunk and found out a scary fact about myself: I love the feeling of being drunk more than anything.

Ever since then I have been out of control. As I have mentioned above I have faced legal trouble and school punishments. I have disconnected with a few close friends because of my drinking habits. I have cheated on my now ex because I got too drunk. I have passed out in anywhere imaginable from Denny's bathrooms to outside in the freezing cold with only a tank top and shorts on. I was denied an almost guaranteed dream summer job of working in a music shop because of my DUI. My blackouts are becoming more and more frequent. The worst part is I feel as if my problem is only beginning to escalate.

Recently I have started ""double-dipping"", mixing alcohol with prescribed drugs. I know how dangerous this is as I feel as if I should have died a month ago at my friend's after conference party. I spent the earlier part of the day in Malibu with friends and I railed (snorted) a Vicodin and a half and day drank on the beach. When I got back to my school my other friends were about to go out so I went out with them. I felt extremely tired and railed an adderall before finishing off 3/4ths of a handle, some shots were shared with friends but I nursed that bottle. I blacked out that night and passed out in the driveway. One of my friends swears he could hardly feel my heart beat and that it was extremely low and it didn't even look like I was breathing. If anything I was in a state of comatose from alcohol poisoning and my friend said that when some girl tried to call 911 he immediately moved me inside, with the help of a few other of my friends to the garage and covered me with blankets before going home. 

Strangely I woke up without a headache, just a feeling of being extremely weak and apathetic towards the night's activities before. Thankfully I don't get headaches from drinking often; my hangovers are usually just a feeling of being extremely tired and not hungry. 

Recently I met a girl who I like a lot; she's a straight edge (goody goody) but I know that's what I want in a future spouse. If I married someone like me I doubt it would go well. Anyways she has shown some interest back aside from her constant reminders that I ""need to be a good kid and stop doing bad things"" and the crazy thing is I'm considering it. Nothing before in my life has made me stop and consider if I need to stop drinking yet for some reason the thought of being with her for the rest of my life makes me want to change. Even my friends say that she's worth changing for. 

If anyone's made it this far thank you for actually taking the time and reading a clueless idiot's rantings. They say the first step to recovery is admittance and I have heard this a million times but I've never heard what the second step is. I know most of you are shaking your heads and I would be too, I've just needed to get this off my chest for sometime. Maybe putting it in writing will help. I tell my friends as at times but it's hard to explain how they respond. Maybe this will explain it.

Almost succeeded too. 

When I was about 7 and my brother was 4 I was mad at him so I pissed on him to show dominance.

I have a deviated septum from a fistfight I got into in 8th grade, with this 6th grader who was literally 50 pounds heavier than me, and it was all muscle. I lost the fight, got punched in the nose, both of us suspended.

I broke my foot playing Dance Dance Revolution.

I've generally committed a shitload of petty larceny from communal fridges, of both alcohol and foodstuffs, to the point where people have gotten pretty pissed off about it (I bring many passive aggressive notes into the world). 

I was a pretty accomplished shoplifter of random shit in this small town I moved to- mostly small stuff in the stores with no cameras, random objects I sort of wanted. Took a t shirt from one store, still my favorite shirt.

I stole probably $200 worth of beer over the period of a few months from a couple of organic grocery stores. Got caught by loss prevention though, had to pay them $300. Worth it at the time though because I was underage.

Also stole a couple hundred bucks worth of weed growing nutrients and general supplies through crafty ass shoplifting. 

I stole 1.5 ounces of weed and and ounce of shrooms from a celebrity's daughter at college.

Only sold drugs once, like an ounce of weed over a week to a group of ""friends"" of mine who didn't have a hookup, and I shorted them on their 8ths so I could smoke some. 

I transported 50 pounds of weed in my car's trunk for about 10 miles for $100 once.

I don't even feel bad about a lot of this stuff. I don't think I'm a sociopath though, probably just kind of a dick. I like to think of myself as sort of a force of nature, bringing general shittiness into the world, which stirs things up a bit, gets people out of their usual routines.

I've jacked off in my fair share of weird places like airplane bathrooms. Also while driving long distance in sweatpants (not too common a situation but it happens) I will slow jerk it with one hand on the wheel to stay entertained. I've jacked off under a blanket in the same room as my parents while looking at my laptop, in the same hostel style dorm room (think wall to wall bunk beds) as a bunch of other bros walking the Camino de Santiago in Spain. Also in middle school I used to sometimes to the same porn as my friends/brother (no eye contact therefore not gay), also once in a church... 

When I was 7 I had a girl friend, she was awesome, we would make potions together and shit by like throwing random leaves in water. Fuck yeah, being 7. I spent the night at her house and there were bunk beds. She was on the top bunk and came down to me and we started exploring each other. I discovered that girls were, well, girls. Then the lights come on, and her parents come in, and sit us both down and have a talk with us, telling us we can't do that kind of thing until we're older, which 7 year old me didn't quite understand, but the shame came through, dawg.

I ""wrestled"" naked with my female cousin when I was about 10 and she was like 8. It *was* pretty much just wrestling though, because I didn't know what to do with my dong yet, and it was OK because it didn't get really sexual. 

This girl and her friend flashed me their pussies when we were at this party with our parents at like age 10. Ended up trying to get with one of them in middle school and she rejected me.

 I have a fetish for jacking off in broad daylight, or more specifically, fucking a girl like animals in the woods, mating, breeding, but I have never found a girl who's up for that. I used to live in a rural area and would go to national parks and stuff, and find a clearing, and strip naked and whack it to the fantasy of rutting like beasts in the tall grass. I don't think anyone ever saw me but it was pretty thrilling. Wouldn't do it here because being seen is too risky.

I lost my virginity at age 20, to a 17 year old girl I had gone to high school with. She was a freshman when I was a senior, and I had come back from college for the summer. We fucked in the cramped ass bucket seats in the back of my shitty GM early 2000s four door. I was the 5th dude she'd ever been with, but her pussy was damn tight. Not illegal either because I was in one of *those* states. Have only been with one girl since and that was a long time ago.

I have saved folders of fucked up porn on my computer. Nothing illegal. Just kinda weird and socially stigmatized by people who weren't raised on the internet. Tentacle hentai, bi porn, BDSM, yiff... And I don't really hide it well, like I'm just asking for someone to see it.

Generally I identify as a straight male, love women, and usually play the dominant role during sex. But sometimes I finger my asshole and think of being fucked. Desired, wanted, taken. I would want a woman in that role though. I am not really into dudes. I've even posted a bunch of pictures on imagefap of myself fucking my asshole with my fingers or a buttplug. I wanted to know what the girls on /r/gonewild feel like, except I have to make due with my profile being commented by gay bros telling me I'm hot instead of dominant bitches. 

I once compared dicks with my friend from elementary school. His was way bigger, which made me sad until I learned about growers v. showers, but he straight up only had one ball. I mean he'd told me that before and I was like whoa dude but this made it real. It was like twice the size of a normal nut. This same kid's little nicaraguan adopted sister also caught me fucking the shit out of this stuffed animal they had at their house. I was there for a week because I had a broken leg, but that doesn't clarify much. Long story.

When I was in Spain I encountered a dude just standing next to a ditch on the Camino de Santiago, watching people pass by and masturbating slowly, staring everyone down like he was daring us to challenge him. I just kept my distance.

When I was in India I stood and watched a cop use his cane to beat the shit out of a rickshaw driver who accidentally bumped his rickshaw into the cop at like 2mph. I only mention it because I think it's fucked up that I didn't do anything, even though I didn't know what to do. 

On the same trip this ""hijra"" (dude who tucks his sack back and wears womens' clothes and is considered a third sex in India) flashed me because I didn't give her money.

I didnt date much through out high school probably because of this and have had a hard time dating ever since, I lost my virginity when I was 20 and was so nervous about the whole situation that I had to stop her and forwarn her that I was different down there.

So I have this girlfriend.  She's wonderful, except when she's not, which is often.  She's an alcoholic, loves popping pills with it, which is a step up from where she was 5 years ago, I guess.  But I am getting to the point where I don't know how to handle it.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will marry this woman.  I love her more than life itself.  But it feels like I'm walking into the abyss when I think about it.  It could go beautifully, or we could tear each other apart.  I try to be supportive, to monitor her legitimate pill intake, limit her exposure to alcohol, make sure that she's doing ok.  But it's taken its toll on me, physically and mentally.  I've been doing this for two years, and it's tearing me apart.

I just got out of jail tonight.  Why was I in jail on Christmas Eve, you ask?  Because, last Thursday, while in one of her ""states"", she became belligerent and violent for no reason I could discern.  I tried to take her pills away from her and she went all catlike, with the claws and the hissing and whatnot.  I subdued her the best way I could without hurting her and took them away from her, but alas, our ruckus had alerted the neighbors that something was amiss, who, in turn, alerted the authorities of the same.  She gets up, falls down, gets back up, falls back down....just an endless cycle of self harm.  This is the point at which I usually try to get her to bed for a while.  Comes a knock on the door.  It's the police.  I answer and a cop tries to shove his way in.  Well, I did what anybody would do and shoved back, informing him as I did so that I did, in no way, invite him into my home, and if he would like to speak with either of us, he could remain outside.  That didn't sit well, but neither did his overly forceful attitude.  I then open the door, call my girlfriend in so we can all talk about what's going on, she walks up behind me, and the cop reaches in, grabs me, and handcuffs me.  I'm a little shocked at this sudden turn of events, until I turn and see that her nose is bleeding.  Now I had to get forceful to take her pills from her, but never like THAT.  I assume she got that by being too blitzed to stop falling over every 3 steps.  Didn't matter, off to the clink I went.  My mother bailed me out today, and the State has taken the case out of our hands and is prosecuting me for domestic battery.  Great news for the holidays.

Her constant drinking and drug abuse have lost us our newborn son, and for every step forward I take in getting him back, she sets me back two.  We both want him back, she just continues to make stupid decisions that harm our case.  Like this.  Now I have a violent charge against me while I'm trying to fight to regain custody of my infant son.  She subsequently gets even more fucked up, gets arrested, can't hack it in jail, and ends up being sent to a mental health facility for a period of time.  I have seen to it that she will not be coming home, but rather will be taken directly to a long term rehab facility where she can try to get the help she needs.  This picture paints her as a horrible person, but she's not.  She's the most wonderful woman I've ever been around.  But this monkey on her back has other plans for her.  

I live in a small town, repairing computers, and I just lost my job over this, I get back home tonight to a note from my landlord telling me to get out of his apartment by the 26th due to police disturbance and drug use.  I don't even own a car.  I walk everywhere, and now have no job.  I have no idea how I'm going to find a place with no money, no idea how I'm going to transfer my belongings to said place.  On top of everything, the Christmas we had planned for each other is utterly ruined, she won't be here, I'll be here alone.  I don't even have the money for a deposit on a new place, if there even is one.  Small town, not a lot to offer.  I have no idea what to do, and everything is spiraling out of control.  My sole means of (reliable) communication is my old netbook, and it's dying rapidly.  Barely runs at the best of times, so it's hit or miss if I can even get out communiques that I really need to.  I have absolutely no idea what to do here.  Everywhere I look are obstacles that I cannot overcome.  I don't even have familial support on Christmas, because they all live so far away. 

I have no idea what to do.  I'm scared, because I'm on the edge of losing everything I've worked for, and there's nothing that I can see that I can do about it.  I feel like everywhere I look, I've failed again at something.  It's killing me, and come Wednesday, I'm homeless.  I don't have any idea what to do.

We decided to take them home and our other friend headed on home. We arrived at the guts house and let them inside because it was snowing and cold, so we couldn't just leave them there. Then Russle decides we should go on inside his trailer which was right up the hill. We did and to this day I regret it. We went up and went inside and saw all this stuff just strewn everywhere, like no one even cares about it. We took some stuff, I only took a buck knife and a hat, which was even too much because it started. Russle on the other hand took a lot more, which later turned out to carry sentimental value to its rightful owner. Later that night guy shows up, he knows someone was in his house, and being 6 ft with huge feet my tracks in the snow were obvious. Nothing came out of it, I was ashamed for the longest time until eventually my mind blocked it out. 2 years later I get word that si ce that incident he became an alcoholic and killed himself. At that point I shut down and stopped feeling emotions. I think it's due it part to having a man take his life be ause of my stupid choice.

**TL:DR A long time ago, while young, vulnerable, and alone abroad, I think I was raped(Was I?). I was also robbed and jailed on false charges.**

**Is what happened to me and the associated trauma the reason why I've failed miserably in life? Or is this me looking for an excuse to justify my failings? If you were me, and knew the person who definitely did rob you, and most likely raped you or helped somebody else rape you while you were asleep, would you seek revenge if there were no legal recourse?**


I graduated at 17 at the top of my class, got accepted into a ""top"" school, and aced my freshman and sophomore years there. My dad thought it would be good both for my resume and ""character"" if I had practical experience abroad, so he pulled some strings and I got a plum job at age 19 in a foreign country with a corrupt police &amp; judiciary system.

I woke up one morning in my rented room with my rectum throbbing in the worst pain I've ever experienced and a bit dizzy and disoriented(drugged?). The locked door to bedroom was broken; I would lock it from the inside every night. Everything was stolen: laptop,  personal journal, family album, yearbook, childhood photos, passport, birth certificate, social security card, high school diploma, all of my salary and savings. I reported the robbery(but not the rectum pain) to the police and was thrown in jail on unrelated trumped-up charge(please don't ask; take my word for it). My dad blamed me for everything; yelled at me when I called him even though I was clearly traumatized; And although he arranged for the bail(bribery) and airfare back home, he refused to talk to me throughout the whole ordeal. All of my family and friends welcomed me at the airport; Not him tho, the bastard.

After arriving, I sunk into a 2 year-long depression where I did little but eat, sleep, and fap. Man alive, was there some serious fapping going own. I was so ""far-out"", lost in the recess of my mind, that I would fap everywhere, oblivious to decorum or even the risk of prosecution. I would discreetly(or so I thought) fap at the public library(no filters, high speed interwebz). Just to clarify, I'm not some sorta exhibitionist. I would fap for the some reason you have to urinate: because I just had to and couldn't help it. My shrink says I had a temporary ""break of sanity"". I think I was doing it to escape my reality: pain, anguish, depression, pitch-black darkness.

Oh, and I gained 80lb almost overnight. Literally in less than 6 months after I came back. People who knew the old-me were so shocked at my transformation that it was evident in their face. Not even social politeness could hide it.


At the time, I kind of went into auto-pilot ""shock"" mode over the break-in &amp; robbery and was panicking wildly over the loss of every single important document in my life, being thrown in jail, and being yelled at by my dad. When I think of that traumatic time-period, that's what stands out. Not the ""my ass is on fire"" pain. For reasons I still can't fathom, my brain merely registered it, like, ""Ok, so my ass is on fire. Why is my ass on fire? I don't know. More important matters to grapple with."" I swear on my honor(whats left of it) that it never occurred to me, until recently(few years ago), that it might be rape. Not even a fleeting thought.

Let's be real: an ass doesn't just catch fire. Asses don't have a spontaneous combustion mechanism. It's very likely that I am/was in denial. So let me just put it out there: Was I raped? I have zero recollection of the night before that morning. All I can remember is that I woke up to a throbbing pain in my rectum and being a bit dizzy and disoriented. Looked up, saw the broken door, checked my stuff, and found everything gone.

Some circumstantial evidence:

- When I went to said foreign country, let's call it Pandora, my dad introduced me to a business associate of his who was probably in his 40s. That guy helped find a place to stay and I would socialist with him from time to time. He exuded a creepy vibe but since my dad introduced me to him, my guard(usually alert) was lowered. Anyway, come to find out years later that the guy was accused of sexual assault which when I dug further found out was attempted rape of a young man. Of course he got off; wasn't even formally charged. $$$ speaks.

- A mutual acquittance would tell me that he personally heard the creepy guy boasting about the robbery(only robbery) and how he had everybody fooled.

- A few years ago, a friend of that ""trusted friend"" who I met and hung out with a couple times when I was in that foreign country, and who I strongly suspect of having something to do with the break-in/robbery, saw me online and started a chat with me. We got into some irrelevant tiff(It's called soccer, cabron. No, futball, maricon), and after cussing each other out, and in order to (presumably, pure speculation) humiliate me, he emailed me a random porn picture of a teenage male on all fours getting railed from behind. Ever heard the phrase, ""jumped out of my skin"", well, as soon as I clicked on the email and saw it, I still vividly remember doing exactly that, jumping out of my chair so hard that I almost fell and rushing to delete the email.

Finally, I have other very strong specific evidence(that I won't share here) that I'd be willing to bet my life on, that the person who broke-in and robbed me was that creepy guy and his friend. And logical deduction would follow that, since they broke-in and robbed me, it's very likely that they committed the ""incident"". How? I don't know. Was I drugged? How come I have zero recollection of what took place? Wouldn't/Shouldn't I have woken up? I'm a light sleeper.

After I got back, all this good stuff happened

- Pops wouldn't talk to me for weeks; he clearly could see I was depressed out of my brain, but no, he thought(and said) that I was being ""spiteful"" and that the only person I was hurting by laying in bed 20 out of 24 hours was myself. The last time I tried to mend fences with him(all I wanted was an apology and for him to tell me that he loved me) was 3 years ago and we almost got into a fistfight. Radio silence ever since, not a single word.

I don't know why I crave the approval and love of a man I literally consider to be lower than dung, but I do, even now. 

- got fired from every job I had. Literally. Just got fired from one 3 weeks ago. Why? I was so antisociall that I dreaded coming into work, dreaded having to be around other people; but for the most part, it's because the only way I could get out of bed was for basic survival needs:eating, using the toilet. Showing up for work and having a work ethic didn't rate high compared to ""just keep on breathing"" and ""god is there no end to this darkness"". 

- ripped almost every relationship I've had (family, friends, romantic, fwb) to shreds. I'm commonly referred to as ""obnoxious"" and ""difficult"". I don't deny it. While I can be charming and funny when I ""have to"", I quickly turn into a manipulative a-hole at the slightest hint of conflict. My motto: Hurt others(if they give cause) before you get hurt. Preemptive a-holery

- was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder type II by two different psychiatrist(nobody knows the diagnosis but me). Which explains the brief bursts of energetic and charismatic ""highs"" I had when I would ace job interviews, woo and bed girls, impress professors; as well as the much more lengthy depressive periods where I pretty much lived in bed, dropped out college(multiple times), got fired(multiple times), relationships ended(multiple time)

- Cheated on my ever-patient ex-gf. Twice. She doesn't know. 2nd time it was with a married mother of 3. Husband found out, marriage broke up. Some people like to blame their (insert reason) for their shortcomings and moral failings. I don't simply because I can't. I refuse be a victim and to have any aspect of a victim mentality, even if I am, technically, an actual victim(hope that makes sense). I take full responsibility and will be feeling the guilt for the rest of my life.

- Not sure if this is psycho-babble or not, but every social encounter was a opportunity for me to assert my ""masculinity"". If you were walking towards me from the opposite direction and you're a dude, I'd walk directly into your path while staring straight at you, in order to ""force"" you to side-step. I ""won"" because I'm more dominant than you and forced you to change your walking path, even though you had right-of-way. I know it's pathetic, but I counted those as victories.

- Was raised in a very religious, very repressed Catholic culture(if there is such a thing). Nobody knows about my cheating, my bipolar diagnosis, or the ""ass on fire"" incident. No one, except maybe a counselor, will know. I will take it to the grave with me. Thems the breaks.

- became a high-functioning alcoholic which i still am. luckily for me tho, no drugs, no DWI, and no criminal record. I hide my drinking very well.

If you were me, and if you had strong circumstantial proof(lets assume it's a confession), and if the culprits were beyond the reach of the legal process, and you had the ability and the means to take revenge(whatever it may be) and get away with it, would you take revenge? I am under no illusion that revenge will bring peace or closure or change my life for the better;No; For me, this is almost clinical: I want to inflict the same pain and trauma that shattered a young man's innocence on those responsible; The perpetrators, quite simply, must pay the pied piper.I am the Pied Piper. I am the one who knocks. Pied-Piper-Who-Knocks

Please be blunt and honest. Please don't filter your thoughts. And Please don't ask me about details that I've kept vague for obvious reasons. But if it's something that will help you understand me and my confession better, ask away, if I can, I will answer.

1376049616.0,21,self.confessions,1k0r8r,i wish my father would divorce my mother and disown my brother so i wouldn't have to deal with their mental illnesses,I_Do_Nothing_All_day,30,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1k0r8r/i_wish_my_father_would_divorce_my_mother_and/,"Both my mother and brother have severe anxiety, depression and anger issues. Unfortunately, this in combination with their personalities make them very difficult people to live with. My mother is a slob. She refuses to clean and will leave trash and miscellaneous clothing littered around the house. She constantly complains about her work and weight/appearance and flies off the handle at any suggestions you give her. Perhaps the most irritating habit is her casual hinting and even blatant statements of suicide and loss of will to live. She also refuses to see a therapist. As a 17 year old having your mother say she wants to die makes you feel like a huge disappointment and ultimately unable to comfort someone you love. She will spend hours on end playing random games on the Internet or planning vacations we can't afford and frankly don't want to go on. This sounds horrible and selfish but she probably hasn't said ""how was your day?"" in well over a year. She lives in a perpetual state of sadness, anger and feeling sorry for herself. She constantly tries to manipulate me into believing my father is a horrible and neglectful person which, ironically, makes me more distant towards her. 

My brother has sadly picked up a few of these tendencies. He is also gay. His anxiety amplifies feelings of being an outsider and abnormal, making it difficult for him to interact with people, let alone accept himself. He spends 13+ hours a day on his computer in his room in the same spot. In the past 4 months he has left the house 3 times and showered only 5. He has not gotten his high school diploma because he failed almost all of his classes, all 4 years. Not because he's stupid, but because of his uncontrollable use of video games. His school is really trying to help him and are doing so many things they don't need to to help him move on, yet he refuses because he feels like he's not worth it. He's attempted suicide 8 times and has made 2 serious attempts of killing me out of rage. He's been to therapist after therapist, been suspended from school for making violent threats once to a teacher and another time to a student, and put on various medications. All 8 attempts at suicide were through cutting. When he was 9 he tried to drown me and when he was 11 he attempted to slit my throat for having the tv too loud. Any little thing will send him into a frenzy of rage and hatred of everything that ever dare have the audacity to exist. He has screamed and almost beaten me because i watched Netflix or used the microwave. He is a total hermit. 

My father works long hours and works extremely hard to keep our family above water. He's my idol. Sadly, his long hours and my mother/brothers inability to clean or cook leaves me with virtually all of the housework. It's been like that for years. The only person who acknowledges my efforts is my dad. Having to juggle school, friends, all of the house work and trying to find a job (only to spend less time at home) is making my life incredibly taxing. My dad resents my brother completely because he knows my brother will never be able to live on his own without a high risk of suicide or rampant substance abuse. Also, because he spent the better part of $45k on an education my brother threw away.

i love my family but because of their adamant refusal of professional help it makes it miserable to interact with them. Talking to them is like walking on eggshells, never knowing what's going to make them angry. i am actually so afraid of my brother i do not let myself be alone in the house with him. The constant barrage of filth, drama and emotional abuse drives a large and bitter wedge between my mother/brother and i. My father feels the same way but still loves them with all of his heart. He also knows my mother does not get paid enough to support herself. 

Saying these things makes me feel like a hypocrite but i just need to get it out there. 

Don't get me wrong, i love them but they won't let anyone help and are falling further into ruin every month and my father, as wonderful of a man he is, should not have to deal with this anymore. Constantly worrying about whether or not he is going to come home to a dead son or raging wife is not what he deserves. 

i feel like a horrible person, but only the strong survive and it's been too long for my mother and brother. It's time to cut them off. 

So there it is. i wish (selfishly) that my father would leave my mentally ill mother and brother so we can move forward with our lives.  

TL;DR: My dad needs to make my violent and emotionally abusive mother and brother gtfo.

It started great, and to this day I love her very very dearly. About a year, year and a half into the relationship, she found out I had been lying to her about drug use (Nothing crazy, but I had been hiding it a while). As time goes on, she beings to tell me I'm abusive, and explaining that my friends are dirtbags, my parents are awful parents, etc. The worst part is I agree with her, and I would throw them all away to be with her. My friends, parents, therapist all say shes abusive to me, but I've hurt her a lot. So I feel like its justified that she lashes out at me. But sometimes I feel like I'm being manipulated and controlled.  She tells me that she hates me, and when I do something to upset her, she'll say awful things to me. (""Fine, lash out at the only person who gives a fuck about you. I hope you die in a house fire""). She tells me shes not happy, that she doesn't like me, that she wants someone else. Then, a day later, she'll tell me that she wants a family with me, and dreams of the future. I'm scared, and lately, when I'm convinced I'm this awful human being, and that she'd be better off without me, that theres only one way to end it. I tried walking away a few times, she calls me and cries and I can't say no. I eat all my words, tell her that I could never leave...I can't stand to hear her cry. It's crossed my mind more and more, and I don't know how to make the thoughts go away. I'm a terrible person for even considering leaving her alone.

I attempted suicide about 5 weeks ago, and nearly succeeded. If it weren't for being discovered at the last minute, I would have died. Spent 4 days in the ICU, then another two weeks in the psych ward to get started on meds. The meds work a little bit. I don't feel that crushing sensation in my chest that used to accompany my depression, but I still am depressed. I just want to sleep. I have no desire to do anything.

Anyway, I don't have insurance (America), and now I owe about 45k in medical bills. At least, that's what I owe so far. The bills just keep coming. And even though my employer was notified of my absence, and I presented a doctor's note, I was still fired. I just got hired part time as a line cook, and I'm trying to find a second job. I withdrew from college last semester because I could feel myself spiraling down and decided that having W's on my transcript was better than ruining my high GPA. The plan was to go back in the fall of 2014 and finish my degree, I guess.

My account is negative. All of these bills are due NOW, in addition to some I have to pay to my university because I withdrew. And in three months I'll have to start paying back my student loans. They just keep coming. I have literally no family, and no friends I feel I can confide in. My girlfriend has been really supportive in that she's been picking up the bills and stuff, but that just makes me feel even more guilty. And I cannot talk to her about any of this because she just shuts down and doesn't know what to say, so I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. It isn't her fault, though. If you knew more about me, you'd probably shut down, too. My county gives me free meds and about 30 minutes of therapy a month. 

Life is worse now than it's ever been, only I am on drugs that block most of the emotion. Still, I can't do this. I don't want to do this. I know this is all my fault, and I should stop feeling sorry for myself, but I just keep thinking about how nice it would be to end it and have it all be over. Every day I get a new bill in the mail. Every day I feel worse. I have no energy, no sex drive (it used to be really high before I was put on these meds), no ambition. 

I just feel like shit because even though I know I love my girlfriend, I just feel so numb towards her lately. It's like I care, but I can't feel it. And I know it will devastate her if I die, but the honest truth is I don't feel like this life is worth living, and hasn't been for the past 21 years I've been alive. And she will get over it. She deserves to be with someone who isn't mentally ill, someone who can get her shit together.

I know I'm selfish. I won't deny that for a minute.

I am emotionally drained from things at work. I am emotionally drained from my relationships with men. These things are beyond my control at this point. I am sick and tired of seeing my fat body. 

My weight was taken out of my control when I was in middle school. I was never thin, but I wasn't considered fat. And then I went on anti-depressants. I blew up like a balloon. Literally. One year I was going between a 10-12 and the next I was an 18. I didn't lose friends, I wasn't bullied for being fat. Really, I never have been until the last year, two friends of friends (both body builders) have bullied me relentlessly behind my back. My best friend stuck up for me, but the other let it slide.

I have also had a problem with self mutilation in the past. My chosen method was razor blades. I cannot wear shorts. There are numerous fat scars on my legs and arms that should have been stiched up but never were. Things have been much better since I really started taking my couseling seriously. It has been nearly 5 years without an alarming cut (small nicks here and there, but nothing major).

This brings me to my actual confession. I have traded one form of mutilation for another. I am attempting to control the one thing that I can take back. My body. Diets haven't worked, exercise just turns me into a fit fat person. (I'm 5'5, 230lbs) I have tried throwing up in the past but it never really worked for me. It hurt and just took too much time, I couldn't get used to it.

Last week I did it. I figured it out. I am trying to drink more water and have a 100oz mug that is great. I drink one a day. I had drank a lot of water over the course of an hour so my stomach was pretty full from that. I then ate about 8 small eggrolls for dinner. (frozen ones you buy from costco, so when I say small I mean actually small). With all the water in my stomach and adding those eggrolls, I felt as uncomfortable as most people do at Thanksgiving.

I knew that it was going to take hours for my stomach to not feel so bloated and horrible. Then I got a thought. What do you do when you're sick and know if you throw up you'll feel better? You know you're going to throw up, so you make yourself and just get it over with.

I went into the bathroom, ran my fingers under the tap (something I saw in a movie, never done it before) and this time used TWO fingers instead of the one.

My stomach was empty in a matter of two minutes. 

Drinking that much water helped so much. It didn't hurt. It came up easily. I couldn't believe it.

The next night I had a burrito for dinner. I wasn't uncomfortable, but I knew that if I was going to stick to this, I needed to be consistant. I downed a ton of water and within an hour my stomach was again empty.

I stuck my fingers so far down my throat that now my throat is sore. And I like it. I'm not trying to make light of people who have been through this before. I know what it is. It's me going back to self mutilation, only this time there will be no scars for anyone to see. I will hopefully lose weight by starving myself slowly.

We were all using a very sparsely populated bike lane next to a four lane road in the suburbs.

I noticed a lap-sized dog in their vicinity and thought nothing of it until I realized that it was chasing and harrassing her as she trembled and tried to get away.

I just hope she'll be okay.,awayIthrow555,29,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/171ckn/i_physically_hurt_my_exgirlfriend_and_i_dont/,"A week ago, my girlfriend(21F) and I(22M) broke up after 2.75 years.  She was my first girlfriend, first kiss, first everything.  The break up was a causal affair, though.  We grabbed lunch and watched tv after the breaking.  I was sad, but breaking up was a long time overdo as I've been dealing with depression and anxiety problems that have strained our relationship from the very start.  

We don't see each other for a few days after that, and I gradually get sadder and sadder as the days pass.  This past Friday, we are at a casual event with a group of friends.  She invites a ""friend"" (who she met 2 weeks ago) as well.  The evening goes all right, but eventually her friend begins to make passive aggressive comments to me, insulting my intelligence and making fun of my slight stutter.  I was already really upset about the breakup at this point, and his comments push me over the edge and I leave the gathering.

Later that night, after spending a lot of time crying and generally feeling bad, I go to her place to speak with her.  I knock, no answer.  I knock again, no answer.  Then, I try the door and she holds it closed.  She squeezes herself out of the door and pulls it shut, fixing her hair and shirt as she glares at my feet.

""Why can't I come in?  I want to talk with you."" I ask.  

""You know why.""  

He was in there.  In the place we would kiss and hold each other and tell each other how much we love one another.  I just couldn't handle it.  I leave and return to my place.  I pace my room, furious.  How could she already be with someone else?  How could she so soon after our 2.75 year relationship?  Why doesn't she respect my feelings like I do hers?

She knocks on my door shortly after.  I open the door and **physically shove** her out of my room.  I slam the door shut, lock it, and hit it a few times.  After a few seconds, I unlock the door and beckon her inside.  When she comes within arms length, I **grab her wrist and pull her inside**.  All I remember now from that moment is the look of terror on her face.  

We talk for awhile and I beg her to stay with me.  ""What's wrong with me?  Why don't you love me anymore?""

The typical post-breakup questions.  Two weeks prior to this event, I started Zoloft to help with my depression/anxiety and have been seeing a licensed psychologist to  do the same.  I made a lot of progress over those two weeks, so I told her that.  

""I'm really getting better!  Why can't you see?  Why won't you give me another chance?""  

But who would give me a second chance after what I did?

There's not much else to say.  She left, called the cops, and I spoke with them for awhile.  No criminal charges will be filed, thankfully, but I feel like a criminal.  I feel horrible for what I did.  I hope one day she can forgive me, but I know that probably won't happen.  I can't even forgive me.

1351759114.0,21,self.confessions,12g6wk,Just some random simple confessions. I have lived with these for years. I want to tell someone.,throwaway57593,28,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/12g6wk/just_some_random_simple_confessions_i_have_lived/,"I am a 22 year old woman with some secrets. Typed in this subreddit to see if it existed, and well, here I am.

My Skype friends and (now long distance) IRL friends think I have a job. I just sleep all day.

My family, my doctors, and all of my friends believe that I hate children (in a non violent way). I always 'accidentally' volunteer and end up babysitting their kids/relatives. Not because I am a masochist, but because I got over that hatred years ago, and actually enjoy being around them now.

The same is true with spaghetti. I secretly love it, but can't tell anyone due to embarrassment (I hated it as a kid. They would never let me live it down).

I don't know how to drive. I have a learner permit, but that is it. I have no idea how to operate the vehicle. I don't know the rules of the road. I have no idea how streets even work. But all of my friends think I can drive. The only person who knows is my mom. I always conveniently get rides from people when I socialize, and always plan events so that I end up not driving. I will even play the ""I won't drive someone elses car, especially if I am not on the insurance"" card. 

Growing up, I hated being touched roughly (due to traumatizing events in my childhood (not abuse, just school kid stuff that some kids took too far). I secretly love being touched now. By accident, on purpose, whatever. Casual touching sends shivers down my spine. I love it. But people are always weary about it because they believe it is killing me inside when they so much as graze me with their clothes when walking too close to me.

And now the biggest of my secrets

I sometimes fantasize about being in a physically abusive relationship, where my SO just decides they will use their fists to do the talking in the relationship, with me never telling anyone out of some sick love for them. I don't mean the occasional hitting of me when I 'misbehave' either. I mean, they walk into the room, and just start beating the hell out of me for apparently no reason, and then making demands of me (cook dinner, go shopping, basic domestic things) I would never seek out this type of relationship, and would end it if it happened, but it is still fun for me to fantasize about in the safety of my bed. Sometimes I think I need therapy, because in the heat of my fantasies, I sometimes think that ""yeah, I am going to seek this out I don't care how dangerous it is!"", but that thought lasts all of a second before my brain yells at me. So I don't know.

I miss her a lot.,KortedalaMoonlight,26,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/11tmbb/short_little_unsent_letter_to_her_i_miss_her_a_lot/,"I’m scared because I don’t know what it means to be alone. I don’t know what it means to be without my best friend, who I’ve been thinking about dearly on a daily basis, and waiting to see so that I could love her and be with her. I don’t know what it means when you like me enough to speak to me but love him even more. I want to cry a little when I realize that you have wonderful evenings with him, cooking and watching TED talks and then going out with your friends. I wish I could be a part of your life. I wish I could do everything I dreamt about doing with my dream girl.

I want to be a part of your life. I don’t want to have to wonder why it is that you don’t connect with me. You used to – how is it possible that we’re not getting along like we used to? What is it, something that we did? Or did we just change? Who got tired of whom? I don’t want you to leave my life. And you’re not. But look, I’m still in love with you, girl. I want to be your friend, but I don’t know how to get over you like that. You seem to have been over me since a little while after we said our last I-love-you’s to each other – at least mutually, because I could never stop telling you that I loved you for who you were. 

Perhaps I’m just attached and not really in love. Perhaps I want someone a little better than you were, at least in how you treated me. Don’t get me wrong, you treated me fine. I love you, and I love the fact that you were always completely honest with me and tried your best while we were seeing each other and talking to each other on a regular basis to be a sweetheart. But you never let me get close to you, once you decided that you didn’t want me to be your boyfriend. You never let me back in all the way, and you never really wanted to open up to me. Maybe I didn’t ask you enough, but after awhile it was difficult feeling like I needed to provide all the energy for what I wanted to be our relationship. I wanted you to meet me halfway, and it’s okay that you didn’t. I’m just a little upset, because I still have that as my ideal. It’s not directed at you. It’s not even directed at me, really. I just wanted a little more before you let go, because now I’m not sure if you’d ever come back, even if I knew that I really wanted you to.

I don’t want to get over you, but I know I need to. It’s unhealthy, and it makes it difficult for us to relate on a normal level. Everyone says I should just move on and stop talking to you. I can’t do that. You’re like my little sister and you (used to be and) are still one of my best friends. I don’t want to let go, especially when you’re fine with things the way that they are. You’ve always been my friend; I’ve been the one that’s been in love with you. I know it’s tough to deal with me, and I’m sorry. I’m focusing back on myself, trying to make my life into something for my own sake.
 
I’m getting over you, and eventually I will be. But some days, I just feel like I’ll miss you forever.

I love you.

My confession: my husband of 7 years doesn't know.  His family is extremely racist, and he was raised that way.  As the years went by, he shed that bullshit, and became the man he is now.  Recently, the idea has been brought up about having kids, even though we were pretty up front with each other that it was something we weren't interested in.  When he brought the idea to me, I must say, I wasn't put off by it, but of course, the black issue was something I hadn't counted on being exposed.  My dad's been dead for almost 14 years, and I have one sister, whom I haven't spoken to in years (she, on the other hand, has many beautiful black characteristics.  The 1 child I know she has, a son, is with her husband, a pakastani man, and he is very dark, with traditionally black hair)  My Mom is out in the world, living her own life, and I haven't seen or spoken to her (aside from a few letters and cards over the years) since before my Dad died, so I kind of thought it would never come up.  First and foremost, I don't know how my husband would take this.  A lie? A betrayal? Not give a shit?  I know, without a shadow of a doubt, his family would shame me, but on that count, I couldn't care less.  In fact, a fantastic reason *to* tell them.

I used to have a crush on him in high school, but now, 2 years out of college, remembering nothing but his indifference, I found it strange he wanted to go out with me. Then, he said, ""let's go out all of us, you and your friend M."", a girl from my work who will remain nameless.

*Sigh*. Ok. I haven't been out for over a month, busy with work and housekeeping. My mom and I live alone, and we have to take care of the house all by ourselves. My deadbeat dad left us over a year ago and hasn't provided a cent since. My mom has never worked, is over 60, never finished school. I have to pay for everything. I need a night out.

Anyway, this guy shows up in his car, half an hour late. M. and I are waiting for him. ""Sorry ladies, I had an inopportune customer"". He brags about his business all night long and shamelessly flirts with M., buys her drinks, pays for her dinner, but not mine. Near the end of the night, I ask him, ""you should show me your shop one of these days"", and give him a flirty look. ""Ok"", he says. He takes me home, then takes M. home. I feel used and angry.

So, yesterday, I call him on his mobile. ""Hey, can I come over to your shop?"" Sure, he says. I het home, shower, and change into the sluttiest outfit I can find. No panties, no bra? check. A sleeve-less t-shirt that fits me tight and shows cleavage? check. A mini-skirt that only covers half my ass? check.High heels? check. Seductive make-up? check. I really didn't have a plan up to this point. I was just angry and jealous and was acting on it.

I take a taxi to goto his shop. The driver can't stop staring at me. Gross! And yet, effective. I hope this outfit has the same effect on him than it did on the taxi driver. 

I show up at his shop at closing time. There are no longer any customers and his last employee is just leaving. ""Why don't I show you around?"", he says. Sure, ok. He starts talking about business, processes, costs, products, and I pay no attention at all. Whenever he points at something, I look somewhere else. I just make sure that whenever he looks at me, he can see a little bit of skin.

He closes shop, ""so, what should we do now?"", I ask him. 

""Do you want to watch a movie? I just bought this blu-ray and we can order some food"", he offers. I agree.

We step into his car, he turns the air conditioning on to the lowest temperature possible. I'm freezing, and my nipples stand out. I can't stop thinking how much I hate him.

We get to his apartment. He lives alone. We order food. He keeps talking boring, until he finds the movie. His house is such a mess! Are we really going to watch ""The Last Airbender""? What are you, 5?

We sit in his couch, and he starts touching my leg. I don't do anything. He then puts his arm around me, and I look at him, into his eyes. He tries to kiss me, and I push him. ""Don't"" I tell him. I just wanted to tease him. He doesn't stop. He starts kissing my arms. I don't stop him. He touches my breasts and starts playing with my nipples, on top of my shirt. I don't stop him. By instinct, I grab his thigh.

He tries to kiss me again. I push him, look into his eyes, and tell him ""I told you to stop"", but my hand is now on his crotch. He looks at me, unsure what to do. I suddenly realize where my hand is at, and I start stroking his penis. I look at him flirtly, and he finally kisses me. I don't stop him this time.

He carries me to his bedroom, and throws me to his bed. He starts to take his clothes off. ""What are you doing?"", I ask him. ""What do you think?"", he replies.

I decide to just go with it. He keeps touching me and kissing me, and eventually, we fuck. About a minute later, I am not kidding, this guy is done. We didn't use condoms, I wasn't on the pill. And worse yet, I didn't even get to orgasm. I look at him and ask him, ""was that it?""

Finally, the food we had ordered gets there. He puts some clothes on and runs off to pay. I lie there, unsatisfied, and upset. I feel worse than last saturday when we went out. 

After that, we ate and watched TV in silence. He offered to take me home, but I refuse. He apologized, and I didn't say anything. When I leave, I tell him, ""don't seek out M. Don't call me again"".

I take a taxi cab and go home. My mom is there. She sees me dressed as I was and judges me silently. I take another shower and lock myself in my room. I tried to sleep, but couldn't. 

This morning, I went to the pharmacy and got a ""day-after"" pill. But I'm not telling him. I haven't called him, nor do I want to call him. He texted me this morning. I erased the text. I feel like a whore, a slut that fell into his game, and completely demoralized. I don't know why I did what I did. I don't know why I ruined M.'s chances with him, either. It appears, she really liked him. I feel like I've betrayed her, and betrayed myself. I feel like such an idiot.

I just needed to post this here to get it out. I'm such a mess.

I have four siblings, but I've only lived with one of them... my younger brother. My dad has always been a huge basketball fan, and when I stopped playing basketball in middle school, he stopped talking to me for months. He and I never really got along, and when my younger brother started playing basketball, my dad made it clear that he had a favorite out of the two of us. He would bend over backwards for my brother, but will hardly give me the time of day. 

Quite literally thousands of dollars are poured into my brother and his basketball dreams... but he never takes it seriously. Whereas I have played the piano for almost nine years and have begged for him to let me go to the city for lessons on the violin and cello, but no. 

It was my dream to go to music school, and my dad threw that out the window by flat out saying ""if you major in music or theatre, I'm not paying for it"". And every application I filled out he would tell me things like ""they'll never accept you there. You're not good enough."" He didn't let me go to one of my auditions and has made it explicitly clear that if I wanted any kind of financial support, I would have to have a 'real' major. 

My major now is computer science, and I'm happy for that, I enjoy working with computers, and I hope to become a web developer, but my passion is still music. 

As for my little brother, he knows he is the favorite, and frequently flaunts it by doing things I am still not allowed to do (I'm 18, but live at home for the moment, so I still have to follow my parents' rules). He will drive to a friends house without a second thought where as I have to beg to be allowed to drive to my friends house, and even then, my brother begs my parents to let him go with me... so I have to take him. 

When he goes with me, he commands attention and is generally a prat. My friends have said that they think he's cool, but they do want to just hang out with me sometimes... but I have no control over that. 

My dad has repeatedly told me to ""get over it"" when I am depressed (clinically) and makes constant threats to disown me if I ever date, marry or associate with non white races. He is disgusted with the LGBT community and says that ""they deserve to burn in hell"", all the while not realizing that I'm as gay as a fashionable rainbow falling over a pride parade.

I hate the two of them so much, they made my youth and teen years miserable and I can't wait to move out. But I fear it won't end even then.

I honestly feel like I don't have a home anymore. In fact, I feel like I haven't had one in quite awhile.  

Now I don't mean this in the traditional sense of four walls and roof. I mean this in the sense that your home is the town you live in, the friends you hold close, and the connections you make. The thing is though, I don't have any; I almost failed out of college, I moved back home where I learned that my parents sold my childhood home and moved somewhere new. All of my good friends had moved away and I had to give up playing baseball which was the one thing I was really good at, was passionate about in order to focus on school, where all I can seem to accomplish is average.

It just feels like I’m renting a room for the time being. I don’t really have anywhere to go or any meaningful connections anymore; I don’t have any here where I’m living now. The closest thing I had to something like that ended when she packed up and moved back to Canada on a days notice. All I really ask for is something or someone that can help me feel like I’m not just drifting through.

I feel silly for letting this bother me so much. I mean I have a lot to be grateful for. I have a wonderful family, and my life is starting to get back on track, as slowly as it feels. I just wish there was someway to feel as though I belong again somewhere. Really, it just feels nice to get this off my chest.

1349531861.0,23,self.confessions,111huv,After gf cheating and a break I sexually exploited her while manipulating her and her partners for my own sexual pleasure. Got back together and took her along a downward spiral for my dark fetish.,freakyflag,33,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/111huv/after_gf_cheating_and_a_break_i_sexually/,"[verification](http://i.imgur.com/Aekdp.jpg)

While dating and rooming my girlfriend cheated on me while most of my time was consumed by working and going to school, leaving little time for her. We were high school sweethearts and together for 4 years (21yo). We broke up for a while. I was devastated but wanted to work it out. 

Back then and to this day guys say she's a 10. She's fair skinned, beautiful face, big blue eyed 5'4, slender hourglass body with huge 38DDDs tits. Most guys noticed her in the reverse order since she's always dressed sexy in revealing outfits. She's fun to be around, loves sex, plays video games, is big into movies, and is definitely a guy's girl.

2 years after the first breakup I was unemployed / working odd jobs while she supported us both. She was getting rides home from a guy who put the moves on her. I was pissed but she told me not to get involved, that nothing happened. It put a strain on us and we broke up. We agreed to remain friends and she'd let me take a neighboring bedroom until I get on my feet. I agreed because I still wanted her back even though I feel like an idiot for wanting it. I later found out that the guy refused to take her home if she didn't give him a blowjob... she was mad at me from a fight so she did and made out with me when she got in.

Still unemployed I had nothing going on and no control over my life. Even though we were good friends I and enjoyed each others' company I tried to get back with her and failed each attempt. Rather then get her back I began manipulating the situation. 

I started with building her confidence in my advice as a friend and a guy. Soon I helped her shop for clothes on a date. She was shocked that I didn't go for something less revealing but went extremely sexy with my suggestions. I befriended whoever she was seeing at the time, gave them a mix of solid advice mixed in with my own sexual fantasies and did the same for her to support those ideas (and vice versa). After my advice was solid I had many great conversations with them... some talked about her big tits, things they liked about her or sex, and things they wanted. She opened up to me with details and brought the guys home to her room. I became a middle man for her sexual encounters and complete living vicariously through her escapades.  

Controlling the one thing I had control over at the time I was taking her along my downward spiral of what becomes my cuckold fetish and exploitation. She and the guys she was with were unaware of what role I actually played.  A year and a half I saw an in, gave the last guy bad advice, and moved in to get back together. I'm not proud of what I did and am not the same person.

When we got back together it was a lot of great times but my sexual fantasies in the bedroom involved her both enjoying and being exploited by other men. I told her about my fetish and she was reluctant at first because because she was oblivious to it this whole time. I told her it came about from her telling me all those sexual details and she felt part responsible. We started with threesomes with an ex. Soon just enjoyed watching and a few other exes came into the fold. I encouraged her to meet them on her own. Things got complicated and emotional for her so we took a break for a few months. 

We went back to it trying a pickup bar where I posed as her friend at first and then we'd come clean. It was working out great. Our day up until getting intimate was perfectly normal. Soon I planned arranged meetings with other men through the internet who come by to pick her up. Occasionally I had her find someone through chat or websites. It started as a fetish and turned into obsessive behavior.  

My spare alone time was soon consumed with finding ""meets"" for her that went into extreme detail. I'd buy outfits for her according to what the other men were into. I was witholding having sex with her for months at a time while she meets other men. It soon affected our everyday and I took a break from it while leaving our relationship open on her end.

We're happily married and have been together at some level for over 12 years. I'd say we are monogamous 2/3 of the time. I go into these cycles where my fetish resurfaces for months where she meets others. I try to go for what she's into too (new experiences, guys much younger or much older).

I'd say my main age of attraction is 9-13. I really like girls at all ages of development from pre-pubescent to post pubescent. I think they're all beautiful. I don't undestand why people pretend children aren't sexual. Its a silly myth you non-pedophiles seem to push. That isn't to say I think adults and kids should have relationships, because I don't. I don't think that sexual relationships (going to the extreme) are inherently damaging to children. Its just that I don't believe its possible for a relationship between an adult and child to not have a negative impact. There are so many many many reasons why, and its pointless to get into them. Suffice to say, I don't advocate for child/adult relationships. I wish it were possible, though.

I'm attracted to adult women, sorta. I prefer women with child-like features (petite, big eyes, tight pussies.. just kidding. i mean, i like that but that was a joke). Its all very confusing. 

I've never done anything wrong with a kid. i fantasize about it, but I don't ever have urges to go out and snatch a kid. I've self-isolated my self from all friends and family. I live in almost complete isolation. My only contact with people is at work, where I am also pretty isolated. I get very uncomfortable around people. I feel like everyone knows I'm a pedophile. I don't know if anyone actually knows. I once had some questionable, but not illegal, images on my monitor when a housemate walked by my open door (I just happened to stumble upon a gallery of artsy photos. Most were adult women who looked younger, but some where children). I also have dropped numerous hints.  I don't mean to, but I think its the sexual repression. People think I'm gay. I'm not. 

I hate life, and I will most likely be dead in the next five years. Ive already tried suicide once.

While she was devastated, I was only sorry she wasn't in it.",pedantic_dullard,25,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/zobpm/my_motherinlaws_car_caught_fire_last_weekend/,"My MIL has lived with me and my wife for 4 years, since the week before our first son was born.  She's been watching our boys (4 and 5 months) since they were born, which is a huge money saver for us, as we're constantly broke due to other financial issue that came up years ago.  

She just won't shut up, she's never been wrong in her entire life, and if I challenge her, she threatens to move out and not watch our boys.  My wife is at her wits end, because all I want to do is kill that woman.  I've more or less stopped talking to her and rarely acknowledge her presence any longer.  There are numerous reasons why.  Here are a few.

1. When my oldest turned one, she insisted on giving him 2% milk, because we didn't really want a fat baby, did we?  I came home from work daily to have lunch with my son, and almost every day she'd taken him to the store to buy just enough 2% milk to give him for lunch.  I found it one time and tossed it, then she started trying to hide it in the fridge.  Since then, I searched that fridge daily and tossed it all the time, which she got completely pissed about because I was wasting her money.  She tried to make me get studies done by people she approved before she'd give him whole milk.  I called the pediatrician in front of her and explained the situation, he damn near freaked out because of how dangerous that could be and said to toss any remaining 2% and only give the baby whole milk.  Now, and only now, was my demanding met with acceptance.  

2.  She's contantly treating me like a damn kid, and all I want to do is dig a hole and bury her.  Recently, she took the time to grace me with her knowledge and told me what it meant when soda was flat. She constantly tells me that I have to use diaper cream to help diaper rash.  She told me last night why I can't give my 5 month old a slice of peach or a grape (which I was making for my 4 year old's dinner fruit bowl).  

3.  She doesn't know how to be happy, and doesn't like it when others are happy.  She had a shitty childhood, abusive parents, ostracized by others, no respect from teachers, etc.  She's never thought to try and be better than that. 

4.  She told my 4 year old it was better to not try to do something so he wouldn't be sad if he failed.

5.  She smokes.  A lot.  Then she'll come inside and rub my five month olds ear to make him smile.  Ear infection two just went away.  

And on, and on, and on, and on.....

Back to the title.   She was actually supposed to move into her own place two weeks ago.  She had her car in the garage to unload stuff when her ashtray fell over and started a fire inside the car, inside the garage.

I'm not really interested in fingering, eating out, or even penetration. The porn I watch is pretty much exclusively blowjob/handjob or sexually suggestive without being explicit. I'm afraid, because I know there's no way I'll be able to sustain a sexual relationship like this.

Also, I dislike seeing anuses as well. When I see pictures of girls spreading their cheeks, it's more disgusting than anything. I can't separate the fact that that hole is where poop comes from. I'm surprised people find it attractive at all.

She was a few years older than me, but we were both nerds. We were close friends and used to play a lot of video games and board games together. I honestly had a little bit of a crush on her, but she was my cousin (though not by blood) and when you're young a year or few of age difference seems so insurmountably large that nothing of any significance ever happened. It was just a friendship.

Anyway, when I was around 14 or 15, I was doing what most boys of that age do, trolling the internet for porn. Being naive and stupid, I believed that it would be less morally wrong if I were to look for porn of girls my age. I'm sure you see the problem with this. Yes, that means child porn. Lord knows how I didn't manage to get arrested or something.

Well, I found some. I found a lot, actually. Not all of it was what I was looking for, but the tools were crude and you mostly got what you got.

Among the pictures I found a picture of my cousin. Child porn. Of my cousin. She was maybe about 10 in the picture. I can tell exactly where the picture was taken, for extra confirmation that it is in fact her. It was not any of the hardcore child porn with adults fucking children or anything like that. In fact I never saw any porn like that, not that I would've wanted to. She was just posing, totally naked, on a beach. 

But still, it was and is completely fucked up. It was a teaser picture, advertising some website that promised more pictures. Were there more? I don't know, I'll never know. I can't imagine, from what I know of her, that the picture that I saw was taken with her consent. Most of the adult men on her side of the family were vile, miserable people. I beat the everloving shit out of one of our uncles at one point later in my life, and destroyed my stepdad's car with a golf club, but that's a different story.

As far as I'm concerned any of them could have been responsible. It of course raises questions about what else might've happened to her when she was young. I felt sick. I still feel sick. That something like that could happen to a person I care about.

But I just didn't know what to do after I saw that picture. I didn't do anything, I didn't tell anyone, I never even tried to talk to her about it. I deleted it, I deleted all of it. That picture is still seared into my mind though, I doubt I will ever be able to forget it.

I kind of lost touch with her branch of the family some years later. I keep track on facebook a bit, she's now got a PhD in Chemistry and seems successful, though still single.

There are so many unanswered questions. I still feel like I should've done something, said something... I was afraid of what would happen. I didn't want to get myself in trouble so I said nothing. Am I a horrible person?

Almost 6 years with the ex. Lots of fighting and a generally shitty relationship. Went on for too long, trying to ""stay together for the kid"". We broke up last October and continued to live together until March this year when I called the cops and evicted her. 

Now that I'm single (and a dad), I just want to sign away my parental rights. I resent my ex for still being able to get laid and find a new LTR while I've had less-than-stellar results (one crazy who I dated for a couple months that ended up wedging herself between me and my son/my ex/my family).

Back in elementary school my two best friends were a red-headed girl who I always had a crush on and a boy I had been best friends with since I was a toddler. 
When I was about 11 I found one of my parents old camera phones in a drawer and started photographing everything. Not long after I found out that my male friend had a camera phone and had the thing loaded with pictures of his dick; so naturally I wanted to do the same. I must have had several dozen albums of those pictures and we would show them to each other frequently. I fucking loved it. I couldn't even ejaculate but I masturbated to the thought of it, and then usually took pictures. Well one time during one of our showing sessions my red-headed female friend caught us... and she liked it... We started taking pictures just for her and one time I actually felt guilt and a little regret and told her I didn't want to show her the latest set of pictures I had taken. She  demanded that I show her and told me that if I didn't she wouldn't be my friend anymore (that was some serious shit back in the day). So I caved in and showed her. Not long after we stopped and i made sure that all of those photos got deleted permanently because it felt so dirty.


I just wanted to get that off my chest.

1372519406.0,21,self.confessions,1hba9z,"I sign into my friends Facebook every day and read his PMs - he's very much actively trying to cheat on his fiancé and I'll probably never tell her (Long post, TL;DR at the end)",A_funny_user_name,27,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hba9z/i_sign_into_my_friends_facebook_every_day_and/,"So, one of my not-so-tech-savvy friends hadn't been on Facebook for a while. I had his number, but most of our communication that wasn't face-to-face was via Facebook, and he hadn't replied to a message I'd sent him about a possible job opportunity (he was looking for a new job and I said I'd help him out). He hadn't even read the message (Facebook tells you when a person has read a message you've sent them). So I text him after a few days about the job, and after a few messages back and forth, asked him why he hadn't been on FB recently. He told me he'd been ""hacked"" - someone had changed his password and he couldn't get logged  in.
I asked him if he'd tried resetting it via his email address, he said he had no idea that he could do that. He had no 3G coverage left for the month (limited data plan) so asked if I could do it for him if he gave me his email password. I said sure. He wasn't bothered, apparently he never uses that email account. So, I requested a new password for him, went into his email account, changed his password and text it to him. Job done...

I wasn't done, however. In his email inbox were emails from various dating sites saying he has private messages, people had commented on photos etc. So, being the nosey git that I am, I signed into those sites (had to get new passwords via his email account) and checked out his profile. He's very obviously trying to cheat on his fiancé with whom he has a son that is less than a year old. I don't know her other than through him and have only met her a couple of times, so it didn't phase me much.

However, what I did next was worse. I signed into his Facebook after he'd been back on (when he got 3G coverage again) and read his PMs. He spends pretty much all day every day trying to get girls into bed. He does NOTHING on Facebook other than send girls messages asking them for sex, phone sex, naked photos, you name it. He isn't even remotely shy about it, he literally just says ""Hi"", tells them he's horny and/or jacking off and asks if they're interested. I now sign in to his Facebook everyday and read his PMs to all these girls - he doesn't know (or at least hasn't asked me) how to change his password, so it's the same one I changed it to back when he'd been ""hacked"".

Luckily, it doesn't seem like any of the girls have taken him up on his offer, but he lies when they ask him if he has a girlfriend or fiancé. None of the girls seem to be up for ""no strings fun"" with him, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time until he finds one that will. A few have engaged in very dirty talk with him via PMs until he shoots his load, then he just moves on to the next girl.

Anyway, it's been 3 months now and I still sign into his Facebook everyday. In fact, I keep myself signed into my Facebook on the Facebook app and keep myself signed into his on my phones web browser. I don't read any messages until he's read them, just in case he notices messages not showing up as new when he hasn't read them yet (though I doubt he would, he really is that much of a technophobe).

He deletes Facebook everyday when he's done with it. I asked him why and he told me it was because his fiancé didn't like him being on there and he sometimes leaves his phone lying around, so he doesn't want her to know he's back on FB (she doesn't have FB). So, for this reason, before I sign into his Facebook, I check mine to see if it shows his name (profile active) or ""Facebook User"" (profile deleted). I only sign in when his profile is active.

I don't plan on doing anything with the information I have, I don't know his fiancé well enough to talk to her and I don't want him knowing how I know he is trying to cheat on her. That said, it does suck for her what he's doing, and I do feel a little bit bad for not acting on this information, because I guess someone should let her know what he's doing behind her back.

He's come very close to meeting up with girls (he works nights and his fiancé works days so he's home alone a lot), but the girls have always backed out last minute saying they'd been told he has a fiancé and a son (faith in humanity partially restored).

So yeah. That's my confession, just wanted to get it off my chest. Not using a throwaway because I know for a fact that he won't even know what Reddit is, and no one I know uses Reddit (as far as I know).

TL;DR My friend is trying to cheat on his fiancé and I know because I sign into his Facebook everyday (and have done for the last 3 months) and read his private messages. I don't plan on doing anything with the information.

I'm afraid to disappoint her so I do all of this life-checking stuff and reorganization.

One thing however, sometimes she's too direct. Sometimes, she really wants to tell me what to do, how to live, what is good, what isn't, how to raise my kids (she's never had kids), how to deal with my ex, my family, my home, etc. etc. etc.

If I stick with her I see myself continuing to make life improvements - to a degree - but I don't think I could really fall in love with her.

He's 29, is extremely intelligent (except for math), has Aspergers, and is mostly a shut in, living with my 58 year old mom. He's a little awkward, but generally very sweet, and he is profoundly lonely.

He had a nervous breakdown at a high school party about 10 years ago, and that led to him dropping out and beginning this stretch of 10 years of achieving almost nothing. A few months ago, he made the first real progress in years, obtaining an online high school diploma. He wants to go to college, and to have friends, and to have a life, but no one in my family seems to know what to do to make any of that happen.

My mom doesn't think he can work. He's incredibly smart, but not good at keeping a schedule (he eats when hungry, and sleeps when tired, with no regard at all for time). I think he could hold a job, but I don't know if he could get one that would be fulfilling for him. The great tragedy is that he's disabled enough to not really be fit for a lot of work, but he's unquestionably smart enough to know that he'd be deeply unsatisfied with a job sorting screws or stocking store shelves at night (not to disparage on those jobs).

He has also never had a girlfriend, and is a virgin, a fact that recently has begun to trouble him very deeply. He makes constant reference to what he calls ""involuntary chastity"", and makes unsettling remarks about how involuntary chastity is a major health risk, as it leads to high rates of suicide. Now he even avoids watching TV at the risk of a show making light of someone's virginity. He has talked about using a prostitute, just to get his virginity out of the way, but I really don't think that will satisfy him. I think the heart of the matter is that he sees that his life isn't going anywhere, and he is unbearably lonely, and this depresses him.

It also really depresses me. I wish I knew of a way to help him. I'm his 24 year old little brother, and I have mostly been very successful in my life. I drive, I have tons of friends, I went to college, and I have a job, all things that my brother doesn't have. He needs friends and a life. The city we're in has no public transit, so I wish I could move him and my mom to a city where he could at least use the subway or the bus.

I don't know what to do for him. I honestly worry that he might kill himself one day. I wouldn't say that he's an immediate suicide risk, but he is definitely deeply depressed.

I'm also terrified that one day, when my mom dies, I am going to suddenly become responsible for him, and this will make my own life's progress come screeching to a halt. I don't want to have to take care of him. And that fills me with a deep resentment. And then that makes me feel terrible.

It sucks.

We basically split into groups of ten and throughout the week I grew closer to everyone within my group, one woman in particular. Her and I always sat next to each other at meals and when we rode a roller coaster at a theme park we visited she held my hand very tightly. She did the same when we visited a haunted house. Our company had to take two flights home due to the size and she was on a different flight than I was but she came down to breakfast in the morning to see me off and once we had both landed (the airport we landed in was 2 hours away from where we lived and we took a charter bus home) we texted until well past midnight. 

When I got back home I was very lonely as my girlfriend of a year was still on a trip of her own with her family, so I called up my group from the trip and asked if they wanted to go see a movie. The woman who I had become very close with was the first to respond and I offered to pick her up as her house was on my way to the theatre. We sat next to each other in the theatre and afterwards I drove her home walked her to the door and we hugged. That was it. 

My girlfriend got home and I told her none of this as I still loved her and wasn't entirely sure of my feelings for this co-worker. 

When I returned to work on Monday my group and I milled around the office just talking as usual. The woman whom I had developed feelings for and I were much more ""friendly"" than my other co-workers were used to. One of my friends in the office who was also friends with my girlfriend took notice and confronted me about it. I told her that nothing was going on and that we were just friends, but my conscience was heavy. 

In the middle of the week my team had to come back later in the night to work on a project and the woman whom I liked informed us that she had been offered a promotion. All of us were ecstatic for her and offered her our congratulations. She then proceeded to inform us that her and her boyfriend had celebrated before she came in to work.  I was crushed. 

That night I confided in one of my co-workers that I knew would offer advice and who wouldn't judge me. She told me that I should tell her how I felt. And so I did. 

I told her about my feelings and she told me that she felt the same. From that point on we flirted quite a bit. She confided in me that she hated her boyfriend and that she only stayed with him out of fear. 

That weekend I told my girlfriend that we were having a guys only movie marathon, and once again picked up this woman. We did go to a movie marathon with co-workers and afterward I drove her home again. When I walked her to the door she told me to stay with my girlfriend and not to risk my relationship. She kissed me on the forehead and we haven't really talked since. 

Me and my girlfriend are great now and the co-worker has since left her abusive boyfriend. I still feel bad about having feelings for this woman and I still find her incredibly attractive. 

TL;DR
I had feelings for a co-worker even though I have a girlfriend. Co-worker told me to stay with gf things are better than ever. 

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest. ",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_v1ys6,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/v1ys6/after_a_trip/,
1337986831.0,20,self.confessions,u57n0,Unloading my brain. Secrets of a 29 years old man.,trowaiz007,21,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/u57n0/unloading_my_brain_secrets_of_a_29_years_old_man/,"Hey r/confessions. This is the first time I've been to this subreddit. I saw it tossed around in another thread and decided that I needed to share myself with you (I'm using a throwaway as well). 
 

In my 29 years of living I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of (ashamed works here too). I'd like to get them off my chest and finally hone up to them. I'll keep everything short and sweet in an effort to curtail verbosity. Feel free to ask me anything, too.
 

* When I was younger I would expose myself to my younger brother. He was around the age of 3-4 while I was 10. I don't know if he remembers this. My dad caught me once and had a talk with me. He didn't come down on me, he just wanted to know what was going on, and why. I couldn't give him an explanation. I still think about it from time to time. Really though, WTH was I thinking?
 

* I started masturbating really early, I'd say around the same time I was exposing myself to my brother. Good ol' channel 98/99, Spice/Adam &amp; Eve respectively. It was a chronic thing (it still is actually but you can add porn addiction now). I don't remember being exposed to anything sexual when I was younger and I wasn't molested. I don't know where all these sexual urges came from or why I would elicit them to my sibling.
 

* I started becoming sexually attracted to my cousin towards the end of middle school/freshmen year of high school (so like 13-14 years old). Not sure how it happened but I suddenly realized she was hot (GG puberty? She wasn't even developed @_@). Right around this time my masturbation was at an all time high. I lived with her, and other family, for a year and during that time I would sneak into her room and sniff/lick her panties. I'm not talking about clean ones either. My cousin's pussy was the first taste of vagina I've ever had. I liked it. Sometimes I would wear her panties/lingerie and jerk it. Cross dressing isn't something I'm into, I just felt that by doing it I was closer to her vagina or something.
 

* I continued to do this for years, well past high school.  In the interim, I had a series of girlfriends. I dated real loser types, the kind that couldn't finish sophomore year of high school. Coming from the blood heritage I do, losers were not accepted. Secrecy was my friend.
 

* While dating the less than desirable and the subsequent dry spell that followed, I would lie to my father saying I was dating this person, or seeing this other girl, oh I have a girlfriend but its not serious enough for you to meet her. Etc. You see, my dad was a real playboy when he was younger and he casts a rather large shadow. I was more socially awkward and very shy. I felt really insignificant and never told him. I mean, he dated some powerful men's daughters from his country of origin, whereas I dated powerfully dimwitted daughters.
 

* While all this is going on I was using my cousin's hamper as my personal spank bank. By now I'd say I was around 17 years old. I would pilfer some of her panties and keep them with me so I could enjoy them whenever I wanted. I still have them to this day and it's been over a decade. I don't ever want to give them up. Funny thing is, if I had the opportunity (even now), I'd totally smash her. I'm pretty sure she knew what I was doing. One of the biggest indicators of interest (IOI) I got was rather inadvertent gesture. She had just finished showering and I was waiting for her to get out so I could take a dump. As I walked into the bathroom she said something to the tune of, ""Oh, let me get my clothes first."" She picked everything up except for the thong she had just taken off prior to showering. I could see it was loaded with juices. I looked at them, then looked back at her. Saw her eyes fixated on my bounty, she stood up and left. I jerked it while eating those panties with voracious, ravenous hunger. I then took my morning glory. I was sure to leave them exactly how I found them. As I left the toilet I could see she had a smirk. I still spank it thinking about her once in a while (even break out the old underwear box). You know what's funny is that she would say things like, ""You have a cute butt. I tell all my friends how cute you look."" I never knew how to respond. If she were to say them now, I don't know, I'd probably run some pickup on her. Fucked up, I know.
 

* Sometime in my late teens, early twenties, my sexual proclivities turned a bit darker. I got into anal play. Started with pens being shoved up there. I got the idea that one pen was great, but 10-15 pens must be way better. Then the handle of the vacuum cleaner while it was running...anyway. Finally bought my first double dong, then a few other dildos. It wasn't the dick that turned me on, it was the fact that I was doing something taboo, something wrong but also exciting. It was the same feeling I got when using my cousin's panties. It was exhilarating. Over the course of time, I was able to take the entire 12 inch double dong and essentially hide it in my rectum. This persisted for a few of years (not all the time, just once in a while, like once a month). There was a period of time I went on a spree and ""performed"" for a few days at a time. I ended up getting appendicitis. I read that it can be caused by fecal matter being stored in the GIT. So my penchant of the anal kind may have played a major role in my illness. After a year or so I returned to it and realized it didn't have the same effect anymore. I basically figured I had enough and trash canned everything. Haven't had an inkling since.
 

* I never had a relationship that lasted longer than a few months (most of the time it was less than 4 weeks). I'd lie to people and tell them I was still seeing my now ex-girlfriend even though we had already broken up. College kind of broke me out of my proverbial shell and I became outgoing and sociable. I got more comfortable with the ladies and started to use them for my own desires. After a couple of years doing this I ended up meeting a girl. She was a real winner let me tell you. Our first week together she had her phone shut off, car broke down in font of my house, overdrew her accounts at the bank, and had credit card bills that were passed due. I don't know why I didn't run for the hills. Instead I helped her get back on her feet (She's actually a top notch person these days. Graduated school, got her finances in order, still has a pretty fucked up affect still but everything else has lined up nicely).
 

* I was totally infatuated with this girl from the start. I stopped talking to my friends, taking anything in life seriously, grades started slipping in college, and I was essentially going broke. It was all about her. She was a walking drama man, let me tell you. Her family was a train wreck. Step-father was a real douche, mother was a ditz to the 1000th power, sister married a drug dealer, none of them had education beyond middle school (except for her mother - high school). All the while I was settling for her. My dad knew immediately she was bad news. He said to just use her and get out. I didn't listen. We were together for a few years (note to self, listen to playboy dad instead of thinking I know WTF i'm doing).
 

* I hated being with her but was too scared to leave. I didn't want to be alone again. She was sexy as hell but had ZERO prowess in bed, zero ambition, couldn't hold a conversation past, ""I had a sandwich for lunch,"" and always expected us to go out and spend money to make her happy. Worst part is, when I would treat her out she would treat me to a BJ and by BJ I mean, she'd gnaw on my unit like a goddamn rat chewing on a nut. She cheated on me, broke my heart on several occasions. I was really unhappy. I felt this way after the first year. Extrapolate this over the course of a few years. I never told anyone this. I told everyone that everything was fine and that I was happy. I wasn't.
 

So r/confessions, I lay this down at your feet for your amusement, scrutiny, bewilderment, enlightenment, and even reflection. If you want to ask me a questions feel free. I'll answer them as I get them.

1325466157.0,21,self.confessions,nz5v2,My parents used to degrade and molest me in odd ways. (long read),JbzzJnes,40,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/nz5v2/my_parents_used_to_degrade_and_molest_me_in_odd/,"I am currently a twenty five year old male from Anderson, South Carolina who is now living in Manhattan. Though I consider myself normal at this point, it's a miracle, given the strange sexual acts my parents used to perform on me. I can't remember everything as my mind shut off a lot of the things that happened to me before they were arrested shortly prior to my fourteenth birthday but I will try my best to share what I recall without having an anxiety attack.

My first memory of being molested was when I was five and my mom caught me innocently touching my ""winky-baba"", as she had so moronically labeled it. Though she wasn't religious and never went to church, she considered this to be ""sinful"" and against god. To punish me, she made me sit in front of my father while he masturbated onto the linoleum tile in the kitchen, she watched as well. Upon finishing, I was told to clean it up using a paper towel before I was forced to smear it on my mothers vagina while she shouted something along the lines of ""This is what your ""seed"" is for, not for playing with and this is how you were conceived!"". From that day forward, I had a corrupt view on perfectly innocent acts of masturbation that all normal humans engage in.

The next major thing I remember was when I was nine years old. My equally fucked up and grotesquely obese aunt with diabetes and her daughter, who was only a year younger than me, came over for supper one night. Being innocent little kids, we decided to play ""doctor"" and got a little intimate with it. My mom and aunt found me cramming the part of a stethoscope that goes into your ear into her vagina as she giggled playfully (Maybe this was wrong, but I really didn't know any better and had already been perverted beyond belief). 

Immediately, my mother lifted me up by the hair as did hers, where we were dragged into the basement, stripped naked and the AC was turned down as low as it would go. We were told to stay where we were until my dad got home, upon which he came into the basement to find us crying. He then proceeded to set up a video camera in front of us and turn it on, then filled up two metal basins of ice water before ordering us to stand in them until we were shivering and frozen to our core. This is where it got rough.

My dad brought the water hose in through the basement door and adjusted the nozzle so that when he pulled the handle on it, a high pressure blast of icy cold, mid-winter water hit us like bullets. At the same time, my mom and her aunt put a carrot in our butts before subsequently belting the crap out of us. This lasted just long enough that we were on the brink of hypothermia. 

When the terror finally ended, our parents had simply *forgotten* why they were ""punishing"" us in the first place (as they were sufficiently trashed at this point). We were able to take a hot bath when they passed out but were never allowed to see one another again from that day forth.

The last thing I can remember was probably the strangest. We lived on a large plot of land on the outskirts of Anderson that was surrounded by trees, so no one could see or hear what went on over at our property. My father took complete advantage of this and one day after making me take shots of his, my moms and my own urine while naked and strapped to a chair at the breakfast table, made me stand in the yard with the water hose up my butt (turned off, god thank you). I was then told to take a water bottle and squirt water into my mouth every thirty seconds and then spit it out like I was a rotating sprinkler. I had to be as realistically like a sprinkler as I could and every time I failed to do this, my father would ""penalize me"" by peeing in my mouth instead of using the water. If I still failed he would whack my penis with his large, leather belt. This specific task lasted the better half of a day while my parents sat on the porch and laughed at me and hocked loogies on me.

I was made to do other strange sexual acts like stimulating my mothers clit at the age of twelve while a well hung, black biker sodomized her as my dad sat tied up in a La-z-Boy recliner nearby and watched. I had to tuck my genitalia between my legs in a ""fruit bowl"" with my arms extended outwards to my sides and ""sit on an invisible chair"" as my dad called it. I had to masturbate my dog several times as well as apply peanut butter to my parents genitals for him to lick off and on several occasions, I can remember my dad putting a balloon, balloon knot first (no pun intended), between my butt cheeks. He then took pictures and sent them to his friends claiming ""I had blown up a balloon with my poo gas"" (my dad really called it poo gas because he was an immature weirdo, obviously).

Of course, tons and tons of other sadistic acts happened until I was finally liberated at the age of fourteen, when a police officer came onto the property over a complaint of what sounded like ""multiple women being savagely beaten"", it was just the sound of my dad using a chainsaw to euthanize several wounded swine in the pigpen. One thing led to another and the police discovered that my dad was running an ""illegal pig farm"" on land that had not been zone for agriculture and livestock.

My parents were quickly arrested and it was soon discovered that my father had been running an illegal pig distribution ring for years, he had even sold several pigs to a man who used them to devour the bodies of several of his ""failed business associates"" according to some information found during the raid of my home. 

Among other things found in the house was a bag of dildo's, stunning amounts of porn, an entire wall of stolen ""Atlanta Journal Constitutions"" that my father had intended to sell illegally and dozens of stolen ID's that my parents had acquired from a human trafficker. All of the people on the ID's were grimy illegal aliens from New Guinea who had been smuggled into America to have their organs harvested in turn for living arrangements and really unconvincing fake ID's that were all registered in Arkansas (go figure).

The worst part about all this, though? My dad had sold all of the child porn to a shady ""porn guru"" from Atlanta only a month prior and when I told the cops about it, they told me that I had probably just imagined most of it and was told that my parents were nothing but petty criminals who were ""too small time for something so sinister"". Supposedly, the chief of police for Anderson, SC at the time, was dumber than Chief Wiggum and Officer Barbrady combined.

I was put into foster care after this and lived most of my life in and out of miserable homes where I was molested and beaten from time to time. Most of the people I'd been paired with were your stereotypical pieces of trash from around the local area. They had less teeth than they had morals and were all wrought with emphysema and COPD. Most of them were in their early thirties and looked like they were on deaths doorstep. I remember not getting much sleep during this time due to the sounds of my foster parents violently hacking themselves to sleep every night.

When I turned eighteen, I ran far, far away to Manhattan, got a shitty job at a pizza place and saved up money while I lived in a small, windowless supply closet in the Bronx that had been seemingly neglected. During this time, the only thing I bought was a lock to put on the heavy metal door. I didn't even buy a cot or a blanket because I had to sit down to sleep.

I finally got a second job, saved all my money and at the age of twenty one, was able to put some money down on a tiny studio apartment above a meat processing plant next to a well lit boat dock that was always buzzing with noise. My floor had a huge hole in it that looked into an abandoned part of the meat packing plant below. Though it was miserable and smelled awful, I got the place at a steal. I only paid nine hundred a month, which is incredible for New York. My landlord was an alright guy but I eventually had to move when he was shot dead by suspected Russian mafiosos over a poker dispute.

I wound up moving back into the broom closet for a while until I could afford another room in a steel Con-ex situated next to what was a dilapidated, old ""kill-house"" the mafia had previously used at the mouth of the Hudson River.

I eventually got a job at Balducci's groceries and eventually became a department manager and at the age of twenty four, was able to apply for student loans without my parents consent. I am currently attending college and trying to put my odd past behind me, but it's kind of hard and I have tried my best not to use alcohol as a means to suppress my feelings of rage. I recently got into touch with my female cousin who'd experienced some of the insanity with me and after a long, consoling chat, we found that we're both very attracted to one another. I will be going back to South Carolina soon to visit her. As well, her mother died after slipping in the bathtub about a year ago. Supposedly, she was so fat that she got crammed dead center in the tub and was too weak and fat to pull herself up. When she grabbed the soap holder, it actually broke off. She tried screaming, but as she was alone, no one heard her and after three days of not being able to get to her insulin, she died. Neither me nor my cousin really miss her much, as she was a horrible person.

Now I am just hoping to move on, live a normal life and have a family. So, wish me luck guys!

I wanted to know where they're from, but didn't have the balls to ask him. I did some scouting on the internet and found that they were from ""my little pony, friendship is magic"" (and the purple unicorn is the main character, twilight sparkle. A name which I think has been stolen from a certain book series.) 

Anyway, I thought I'd watch the first episode just to see how much I could stand. That's how it began! I ended up relating to the protagonist quite quickly, she was someone who prioritised reading and alone time over friends. Something I shamefully understand. I was curious as to how Equestria was going to be saved from what seemed to be a pretty certain visit from the evil night-mare moon! It involved these mystical elements of harmony? Also, the awkwardness of friendships was something I could relate to again. The story, though designed for children; it actually taught me to be more open, face my fears with laughter, and how to be a good friend. Skills someone as depressing and cynical as I usually am certainly need to improve on.

The story isn't all that moral however. Princess celestia, the glowing ""good"" horse who rules the day. Celestia shunned her sister for 1000 years, banishing her in the moon, just because she decided to not let dawn break because she was a little sad at everyone being asleep during the night which she ruled. What a bitch! I mean, a thousand years! However, When Luna (the shunned princess) got her freedom, she took the ""two wrongs"" approach, so she's not exactly innocent either. Kudos to Luna for forgiving Celestia in the end.

In this real world, so cold, cynical, harsh, lonely. Where all I'm encouraged to watch on TV is stuff about serial killers, getting drunk, a million different ways the world might end and a bunch of shit that rednecks do (the discovery channel +nat geo basically)... I guess friendship really is the magic we all need. The magic I've been missing. Plus something so colourful, happy, sickeningly sweet, is just what I needed to pick me up in these hard times. Thank you, my little pony. Now on to episode 3.

1376432557.0,21,self.confessions,1kb4wc,I feel uncomfortable around my brother,frowabay,31,10,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kb4wc/i_feel_uncomfortable_around_my_brother/,"My brother and I are 12 years apart (I'm 23; he's 35). We lived together until he left for college, and then I saw him very sporadically for the next 4 years until he graduated and decided to move to cross-country, where I now hardly see him at all. However, this summer, after having not seen him years, we decided to live together for a month, and it's been a really interesting experience so far.

When I was younger, I really looked up to him, thought he was cool, and always wanted to hang out with him (though he didn't want to). I remember that whenever we'd visit family friends he was always the center of attention and I was envious since I'm more introspective and shy. He was never great with grades or set to get a great job or anything, so I never thought he was perfect, but I always looked up to his passion with computers and his charisma. 

It's been a long time since those times now, though, and... I'm feeling really uncomfortable. It's not just that I idealized him and am realizing he's just a person. It's that the person who he is is completely incompatible with what I thought of him. He's high functioning and kind but mentally very childlike, and he talks in a really nasally and odd-sounding voice. I can't really have a meaningful conversation outside of asking about his experiences in away from home, because when I try he doesn't seem to be able to say anything other than really shallow observations. And he makes a lot of jokes that I just don't find funny, and so I give a pity laugh and try to avert my gaze because it's uncomfortable for me. Normally if I felt uncomfortable with someone, I would just let distance grow between us, but it's complicated because he's my brother and I have a lot of emotional baggage.

I can clearly see it's not that he's changed; it's that I've changed. I knew him only when I was really young, but when I hit puberty and started growing up he was out of my life, and so my mental image of him grew up with me while it seems like he didn't. The rest of my family acts normal around him, and I just don't know how to. It feels like the older brother I had was a lie, and that I'm the older brother now.

What should I do? I feel absolutely *terrible* (I started crying while writing this). It's not his fault he's different than what I thought he was, and I want to be able to get along with him. He's *such* a nice person, but when I interact with him it's just so uncomfortable for me and I'm constantly judging him. I'm also afraid to talk to anyone about it because I feel like the things I'm thinking are terrible.

**TL;DR: I only really knew my brother when I was really young, but I always looked up to him. We are finally living together for a while after years of having not seen each other, but I feel really uncomfortable trying to interact with him. Mentally he doesn't seem very mature, and so I just can't relate when I talk to him. This hurts a lot, because I love him, but it feels like my older brother is gone and now I'm the older brother.**

Alright. I was a really chubby, nerdy teenager. I'm OLD so I was in middle school when the internet started becoming a thing. I found a lot of solace online and liked talking to people. I ended up actually joining a poetry forum (Yeah, I know) and befriended a bunch of great people, but there was one good friend who stuck with me over the years. We'd fall out now and again (we could both be very stubborn and opinionated) but we always had a good connection and friendship. Sometimes we'd get busy and go months and even years without speaking much, but when we started up again, it was as if no time had passed at all. 

We were friends like this for over a decade. I'm female and he's male... there were times when I had a crush on him, particularly when I was younger, but the friendship was always the main thing. We both had other long term partners and it was never really an issue. He helped me through my divorce. He helped me keep the faith when I felt like I was losing everything. I hope that I was a good friend to him too. 

I'm not sure what happened, really. I divorced and took a job in another country. We were always hundreds of miles from one another.. now it is thousands. As suddenly as we started talking, we stopped. I had become serious with my now-boyfriend around that time. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. I wondered, sometimes, if there was something more than friendship between us... I didn't know, though. I always thought he was the sort of person who would be frank with me if he wanted something to happen between us. I felt that he knew that I'd be willing to explore that.. but maybe I was wrong. I guess that part doesn't matter now, since I am very happy with my boyfriend, but I just wonder if that is why he stopped talking to me. He deleted his facebook. I have his email, but he doesn't reply when I send him messages. He's always tended to 'disappear' sometimes, but I have to say that I miss my friend. 

Everything in my life is great. I've been with my current boyfriend for a bit over a year. The job and everything is amazing... but I wish I could share all this with my friend. I wish I could know what he is doing. I hope he is ok. I hope he is happy. 

B, I miss you. I know you reddit (you introduced me to it!) so on the off chance you read this, I'd really love if you got in touch. If I hurt you or took you for granted, I am sorry. If I annoyed you or asked for too much, I'm sorry. I can try to be a better friend. If you'd rather not speak to me again, I hope you are happy and well.

Back in the day, whites fraudulently enrolled in the Dawes Roll to get Cherokee land and today my Native American nation which is the biggest tribe in the country, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, is close to 100% white. And we are federally recognized by the government. 

Here are five posters that shamed me. 1) http://i.imgur.com/UCIA2qS.jpg 2) http://i.imgur.com/euunb61.jpg 3) http://i.imgur.com/1tDXvak.jpg 4) http://i.imgur.com/081P0be.png 5) http://i.imgur.com/6PbF6BE.jpg

What shames me even more is that my tribe has been close to 100% white for several generations. And no one even knows about it. Even all our Chiefs have been white. We white Cherokees also owned slaves. That is even more shameful part of my tribe's dark history.

Can anything be more shameful? Yes! A few days ago, my 100% white tribe threw all Black slave descendants out of our Nation and deprived them of their citizenship. If America threw all Blacks out of America and deprived Blacks of US citizenship, there would be a global scandal. But when my Cherokee Nation threw all Blacks (descendants of former slaves by Cherokees) out of our Cherokee Nation and deprived them of citizenship and all benefits that come with citizenship, the world didn't even notice. I am truly ashamed to be part of a racist white tribe that gets government benefits because we are federally recognized. This is a huge fraud we of the Cherokee Nation are playing on American taxpayers who support us financially. Of course, the Cherokee Nation will send out this link on a listserv and all my white Cherokee brothers and sisters will downvote me for speaking the truth.

These things don't get coverage in the national news, so thank you Reddit for allowing me to bring such scandals to national attention. America needs to discuss a few things like should we whites get preference and affirmative action just because we have a piece of fraudulent paper called the Dawes Roll that says we whites are Indians? Should hardworking American taxpayers support us whites who are Indians on paper financially to the extent that many of us never have to work at all? Do we deserve to get preference in law school, medical school, dental school and college admission even though we are white?

By the way, we have been a white tribe for several GENERATIONS! All the Cherokee Nation Chiefs have also been white. Here, check them all out - my former Chiefs and the present Chief:

I'm just going crazy.,awaythrown3656,26,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1gj6yf/confession_about_the_last_week_that_i_have_to_get/,"I did this in the form of a very poor short story for some reason. I don't know why. I'm just dying for some response, even if you just call me a dirty whore, it's eating me up.

I don't even remember when we started touching that night. But it was going to happen. We left the house party and went to go eat with a few other people and we held hands on the way there. The others ignored it  We played footsie under the table. We exchanged meaningful glances but we mostly avoided eye contact. The eye contact can be the worst. With the eye contact you know there's more than just lust or drunken fumbling.

After dinner it got bad. I don't know how or why we did this. Our friends were walking ahead, talking. He pulled me behind a bus shelter and pressed me up against it. He kissed me. I could have stopped it. I even briefly resisted. It was better than I remembered it being last year, so much better. I don't know how long we stayed there and I don't remember when he led me to a side street, into some office building entrance where we sat and talked and kissed and I curled up against and into him.

I think I said it all. That I loved him, but I also loved my boyfriend. That I didn't think that we stood a chance as a couple, and that it seemed like a terrible idea for me to leave someone I do truly love and see a future with to have what would most likely end up being more of a fling with someone whose goals are incompatible with mine. He said the same thing that she did, questioned my commitment and motivations for staying with the boyfriend if I have that sort of view. He suggested we go back to his and promised we wouldn't do anything more than we already had. I'm usually not great with promises to myself, but I needed to keep this one.

We got a taxi back to his, went to his room. I took off my bra but stayed in my skirt and top. He got down to his boxers. He held me, he kissed my neck, he played with my earlobe. As we lay together, he wrapped his arms around me. He moved under my top, which had a tie around the waist and his hand stopped there. When I untied it he made a noise I feel I've heard him make before. It was a bit of a moan of pleasure combined with a groan of resistance and imminent regret, though his hand didn't hesitate. He tenderly cupped my breast and played with my nipples. I don't know when we fell asleep, but it wasn't the same restless sleep of the week before. It was comfortable and warm. For me at least, I may have been pushing him off the bed a bit. I find that funny, because with the boyfriend, I'm the one who's always pushed and he always takes up all the space.

When we woke in the morning we spooned and took turns being the little spoon. I rested my head on his chest with one arm laying against him while he wrapped his own around my shoulders, lightly gripping me and slowly running his hand up and down my arm. He kissed me on the forehead. I kissed his chest. We had glances of eye contact. After a while he got up, grabbed a towel and put on his robe. While he was out I put on my bra and brushed my hair. It had remained relatively tangle free overnight, which I was thrilled with. Maybe my new conditioner works. I did stay in bed, though. After a while, he returned.

""Cold light of day doing anything for you?""

It wasn't. We agreed breakfast was in order and he dressed, in the same clothes as the previous night. When he emptied his pockets we joked about the volume and oddness of their contents. I put on my shoes and we went outside. We walked, probably 15 or 20 minutes. And we talked, but not about the thing that was just sitting there, waiting to be brought up. But it was so enjoyable. If we had been on a first date, it would have been ideal. It was slightly awkward, but interesting and fun and lighthearted. We bonded a bit while keeping it very casual and we avoided touching. I had left my coat at the party and I was cold. We found a place for breakfast that was so much cooler than we were. All the tables were reserved, but we took two seats at the sharing table. There were two women there, one of whom was very American and talked the majority of the time. She took a picture of her food, which was an absolutely normal-looking breakfast. Shortly after we arrived a woman on her own sat down with a magazine. She looked slightly nervous about eating on her own, but she carried it off well.

We ordered and talked and ate. It was brilliant conversation. I don't remember the last time that we talked while sober. We don't even text or chat online. There were times he would say something about ""don't think I haven't noticed that…"" and I realized how incredibly in sync we are for people who rarely converse. Everything we did was completely obvious and known. We really never had a chance of hiding from each other. It took a long time for our food to arrive and it took me a long time to eat. Everything was so perfect and there were fleeting times that I was able to forget the situation and just enjoy being with him. I'm so grateful for that. But of course it couldn't last forever. At one point I said it.

""You know we have to stop doing this.""

I don't think I needed to say why. We'd never really addressed this before apart from that one time last year. But that was when he had a girlfriend and I was single. And it wasn't in person. I know how much I am to blame. I didn't try to make it stop because I just didn't want it to. I enjoyed it too much and no one was really getting hurt. But we went too far this time. And we have to stop. The potential for pain for everyone involved is too great. The one thing I couldn't read from him, was what he thought was coming, what I was going to conclude. Thank god that we were at that sharing table, sitting side by side. I'm proud of how forthright I was, how I left no room for doubt, but I couldn't have handled it if we were sitting directly in front of each other. Though, there was one thing that I desperately needed him to know, and I looked him in the eye to tell him.

""You said something last night that cast doubt on my relationship with him. But this isn't me being bored in my relationship and looking for something else. This is specifically about my feelings for you and nothing else.""

He has such beautiful eyes, and whenever they meet mine it cuts right through me and I feel this excited jolt that both scares and excites me. It hurt so badly to have to draw that line in the sand. We assured each other this wouldn't mean a retirement from public life. We would just be careful getting too close or too drunk together.

The long walk back together to my car was a relief. I didn't want to be alone. I wanted to be with either him or the boyfriend, but I didn't want to be alone. Alone was painful, so much replaying in my head, so much wishful thinking. And I knew we may not have this kind of time together ever again. I swear that I could feel the physical tear in my heart.

We said goodbye and we hugged. We tried not to linger, but still, I was able to touch him. Part of me wanted to touch him, to hold him, to be held by him for as long as possible. To breathe ""Oh, fuck it"" into his ear as I grabbed him and kissed him and we stumbled back to his. But I knew I could not and so I let go.

After what felt like an exceptionally long and fraught and traffic-filled yet empty-feeling journey, I arrived home to my boyfriend. I saw him and smiled. I couldn't not. He smiled to see me as well. I didn't forget everything, I couldn't. But there, warm in his arms, I felt happy, safe and comfortable. I thought about him and how happy I was with him and until he had to go to work, I was okay.

Then the loneliness and the doubt and the thoughts came rushing back.

The strange thing about loving two people, that I really didn't understand before, is the lack of overlap. To speak in terms commonly used to describe love, it is as though each of them occupies an entirely separate space in my heart, devoted just to himself. Apart from actually being able to be with me, they are in competition for nothing. I don't know what it is in my brain that allows me to physically feel the pain, as though a piece of my heart has been closed off and blocked but is wriggling about desperately trying to reemerge, but I hate it. Maybe it will go away. Maybe it will be like this past year and a half and I'll be able to push it out of sight, out of mind, but only temporarily.

I want him to find someone who he loves and who is good for him. I want him to be happy. It will happen and I will be insanely jealous and I will be terrible, but we'll get past it. And I'll just be here. Staring just a bit too long a bit too often at the picture of us from that night. Still happy with someone I love.

I always provide my animals with the best possible care, helps to be a bio major. They eat better than I do. I have self sustaining food sources for them, but those sources have been short on what they need right now, and my dog desperately needs to stay in his training course to help his extreme anxiety. Basically, no money to feed myself, all goes to animals.

 
My boyfriend I met shortly after moving here lives an hour away And is as broke as me. To top it off, his car got totaled and the new car keeps breaking down. He's had no luck job searching (he's not in school) and the job lined up for me in my schools bio department went away. I don't have enough time for a full time job, so I went to Craigslist for odd jobs I can manage (like pet sitting, or help landscaping).

 
Recently I found another thing that I thought would be pretty decent for me. Another student at my college said he was looking for someone to help him recover from a bad car accident that didn't seriously injure him, but left him in pain that only continued to worsen.


I thought to myself ""why not?"". This guy sounded like he needed help bad. I have moderate experience with physical therapy for rehabilitating injuries. I also have a fairly good knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and try to learn what i can from my own excellent chiropractor. It was 15 dollars for 20 mins; reasonable imo.


So we messaged back and forth for a bit; he asked if the price was ok, to which i said yes and that i know how it can be to be in a lot of physical pain from injuries. I think thats when he realized i didn't quite get it. He brought up that i didn't seem to comprehend the entire job. He was looking for a ""quick tug"" at the end, typical guy he claimed.


He was right in that i didn't get it all the way; i can be rather naive sometimes. However, it was no foreign concept. In the past, i had given massages as favors, but never with that kind of addition. It was late at night when i was responding to it, and i didn't think much about it. i replied, ""oh, well not for that price!"", to which he responded with an offer of $40 dollars for 20 mins instead.


I dont know about the rest of the world, but $40 was not a small sum for that little time to me. That would feed me for two weeks in some situations! i thought about my reptiles, my bf, his car, and my dignity. Then i said i would do it.


I'm a very sexually open person, but this was uncharted territory for me. The prospect of touching some random dude like that both frightened and excited me in multiple ways. Though, i think id have the same reaction if it were a simple massage, but at a much lower magnitude. The one thing i couldn't stop thinking though was that, in essence, i was selling myself. I felt disgusted with my agreement and resulting feelings about it. We arranged it for the next day where we both hand an opening in our schedule of classes.


The next day, my anticipation and the like were no less, and i concentrated a little less in class. I made the hike to meet him out front of his dorm/apartment thing. He ended up being a pretty average guy, on the fitter side. I don't know what i expected really. It was clear that we were both a little nervous, it didnt seem to be something he did often either.


In his room, after typical small talk, he proceeded to undress awkwardly and lay on his stomach on the bed. He apologized for his body hair, mentioning that he cleaned his room and groomed himself to prepare for my massage. Truth be told, i tried to not look so gross myself. It felt eerily similar to a first date between two geeks. His awkwardness reminded me of my first date with my current bf, which made me feel disgusted with myself with renewed vigor.


I straddled his back (clothed, not making me uncomfortable), oiled my hands, then got to work on his ligament and muscle damage. I asked questions about where his pain was, located the tight muscles that would correspond with the pain, and work out the knots. Thinking of anatomical models and remembering what my chiropractor had told me distracted me from the situation. I talked with him about what i was doing, why i was doing it, and how he could help fix it. We also talked about our lives. In retrospect, it very much reminded me of talking to a hairdresser.


When i got to particularly painful areas, he would clench in pain, which resulted in squeezing my leg. I then remembered what i was expected to do. I ended up working knots out of muscles for almost 2 hours. I think it was partially because i felt bad about all his injuries (e.i. it hurt to breathe) and also because i was stalling unconsciously.


Eventually, i accidentally mentioned my breasts when talking about water polo. He used that as a launching pad to ask about them and if they got in the way (DD's). I have no issue talking about my boobs to strangers, but i knew where it was heading. At some point, he craned his neck around to look at them (as he certainly ""hadn't"" before).


I feared this situation would arrive, and dreaded it. For some reason, i have a huge aversion to telling people ""no"" (though i can when i absolutely have to). I don't know whether its a form of seeking approval or what, i could never figure it out. He proceeded to awkwardly work toward the final objective. ""Can I touch them? Can I see them? Oh, they're so warm, can you put them on my chest?"" By that point, he dropped the pretenses and began touching me in various places; sucking on me, squeezing me - all the while i only sat there in self loathing and guilt.


After a bit, he asked me to help him along by removing my pants and throwing in some manual stimulation. I retreated farther inside my head and did as requested. At some point not far in, he slipped his finger inside of me and promptly finished. Continuing the awkward theme, he thanked me and complimented me some more (as he had been throughout the whole time). We got dressed, i took the money of the dresser, and we both went our separate ways to class.


Now i was completely unable to focus properly. I thought about what i had just done, how terrible i am for it, and how i had agreed to continue.



TL;DR- Broke college student (me), with a bf, got paid for a massage with a super happy ending, and agreed to continue. Basically, feel like a prostitute of some sort.
 
It feels a bit better to get it off my chest.  

I can't stop thinking about if the money is just some justification for some weird sort of affirmation or rush i get out of the encounters. and i can't decide what level of horrible i am for doing this.

I'm not sure why, but I did some things that I can't explain why I would have done them:

I threatened to kill the neighbor kids. I have no idea why I did this.

My sister and I took nude pictures of each other when we were kids. 

We wanted to get married when we were too young to understand what that meant, we've kissed, played ""doctor"" several times, watched our parents porn together, performed oral sex on each other, and attempted to have sex at one point. I tried cuddling her a few years later, and she wasn't interested. We have never talked about any of this.

We are 21 months apart, and we were in 6th and 7th grade at the time. I wonder if/how this has messed either of us up. I don't think I molested my little sister, but I do think we were exploring each other.

Our parents spanked us if we misbehaved, but never seriously abused us. I used to think spanking was acceptable, but have recently decided that it's an unacceptable use of violence against a person who can't defend themselves. They stopped sleeping together around the time I was 8. When my sister and I were 9 and 12 respectively my mom was cheating on my dad and he moved out. A year or so later they divorced and we've never talked about it much. After I moved out at 18, my mom's ""cheating boyfriend"" split up with her and went back to his wife. There was later sour grapes and my mom went to get some money he owed her, he assaulted her. I can't help but feel she brought some of that on herself, but that's another topic.

I have been touching and penetrating myself anally since before I was a teenager. Now I enjoy receptive anal toying, and anal masturbation. My favorite porn is also anal, it's probably 75% of my porn consumption. Extreme anal porn is the best. Gay porn doesn't really do it for me, bisexual is alright, and t-girl pron is good too. Some of them are extremely beautiful. I'd probably sleep with a t-girl, but probably not another man.

I don't really talk to my family much. My sister and I share a pretty strong bond because our mom left us alone so often (her boyfriend lived 2 hours away). I wish we could talk about the incest stuff, because I want to be sure she's ok with it, but I doubt either of us has the courage to bring it up.

I would almost kill my ex wife if I could get away with it, but I couldn't do it because of the emotional damage it would do to my daughter.

1340396276.0,19,self.confessions,vg9tw,I've been obsessed with one of my classmate because I have daddy issues ,THROW_AWAY1lol5,20,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/vg9tw/ive_been_obsessed_with_one_of_my_classmate/,"My dad divorced my mom in December. He left us (4) to live in a small apartment, I'm in the same room as my mom, also the living/room where we eat, sleeping in a mezzanine above one of the benches for the table because there isn't enough room. You have to wait for the other to pass because the room is so small in the apartment. He left my mom to work 3 jobs now, because she hasn't been working for 17 years and couldn't find a job that can pay the rent. We live near Paris, so the rent is super high. We're staying here because it's next to an international school and my mom wants us to have a good future.
My dad cut off all contacts. He sent one letter, which his own mother forced him to send because she doesn't find it very acceptable. Do note that she was the one to make me and my sister sleep in a closet (yes, a closet) when she begged us to visit. Oh and she ""forgot"" to serve me and my brother at times during dinner.
Anywho, I never get to see my dad (I'm kind of relieved, but still looking for a father figure. I suddenly realize how hard my mom is working for us) and my mom is constantly working, wether if it's being a ""surveillant"" at school or translating things at home, earning just enough money to have food on the table.
Fast forward a bit. So the international school has a lot of rich kids in it, including this one kid who's dad is one of the famous reporters on channel 1. Big deal, we don't really act on it. It's not like we'll meet him if we're friends with her or something, we know better. I try to act indifferently to the fact that her dad is famous. Feel somewhat bad for her, as she still has to doubt everyone who's friends with her. I still hang out with my friends, and watch half the class almost lick her boots. I can see she's trying to ignore it. She's a nice girl, doesn't like to doubt everyone, but you can't help but notice the way she acts when her father is mentioned. Nevertheless, at one point I overhear a conversation with her and some other people about her dad. She says she really hangs out with him a lot. She goes along well with him, and she has a ton of pictures with him. He really takes care of her. 
At that point all the memories of all the excuses my dad gave me flood back into my mind. I remember all the ""I have too much work"" or the ""the whole section is depending on me"" even the ""if I don't do this, the company'll fall"". I remember the excuses he threw at us explaining why we had to spend hours helping him on a Napoleon project even if it had nothing to do with his Job. I remember him trying to prove why we always had to help him yet he never took care of us. I remember him leaving his own daughter sleeping outside on the ground because he was busy with an important call. She had to wait for my mom to come back. I remember him locking my sister in the dark, muddy, damp basement for a whole night, preventing us to come help her because she had acted badly. He never hit us. He knew that my mom wouldn't accept it. But he still was a bad father.

Anyway, I become obsessed with her and her dad's relationship. Suddenly I see them on every corner, simply shopping together or taking a walk. When I walk around town, I find myself looking for them, possibly seeing a family moment. I start imagining what it would be like if I had a father like that, I start thinking that all the excuses my dad gave me was bullshit. I start thinking that if a famous guy like him can take care of his daughter, why can't my dad take care of his daughter too? I start wondering about all the moments they could of had together, what it would have been like if my dad did it too. 
Then I remember a single phrase my dad said: ""when I come home now that I'm divorced, at least my furniture doesn't bother me"" 
I'm worse than furniture to him. I'm worse than fucking furniture.

I still have class with that kid. The last day's Monday. Then I might move over the summer, my mom is trying to get us out of this hellhole. She never talks to me. Well she does.

To say I feel like a piece of shit is an understatement. Just thinking about these events again makes me sick to my stomach. I'll rehash the story in as much detail as I want to bear:
I came to their place at night, it was me, her, and two of her friends. We were going to go to a bar and drink a bit if we could get in. I had no intention of doing anything with her before I got there, but basically when I walked in she was being flirty and sexual from the outset; this caught me off guard and I really wasn't expecting it at all. The last I'd seen of them, they were very close and sexually monogamous. She'd revealed to me later that night, essentially without my asking, that they were now sexually open(with the exception of friends, which was never revealed to me but in retrospect I should have figured out before I'd tried anything), while continuing to flirt with me all night. For some stupid reason, it had never occurred to me what I was doing or why I was following through with it but I went along with it. I had spend the summer back from school working on various large tasks that had to be done as well as doing most of the cooking and cleaning for my family, so I was exhausted and to be honest, lonely. We had been drinking quite a bit, but we'd got back to their place after walking around for a while going to bars and everything had died down. Her two friends had gone to bed, and we were alone. I was being incredibly shortsighted, and when I'd gone for a hug goodnight I'd regrettably followed through with a decision that would kill a friendship. The morning after, I'd left, and I started to feel sick to my stomach. I've been force-feeding myself to make sure I don't wither away, as I've had no appetite since. I'm working damage control right now, and I'm figuring out how the hell I'm going to apologize. I don't expect him to forgive me in the slightest; I just hope they can work it out and get back to (somewhat) normal circumstances, and I can clear my conscience. I don't need advice persay; I've had incredible support from friends who have listened to me and accepted my mistake, and who have helped me make it through an anxiety attack that could have proved disastrous. If anyone on this sub has ever been in a similar position I'd love to hear from you; while I'm certainly calmer now that I've had time to discuss the issue with friends and family members, I'm still afraid of what could come about as a result of this.

Well, beginning of the school year, we decided that we were a bit too fat for our liking. We're about 5'10 (me) and 5'8 (her). So we started ""The Diet""...which we had done before, but we kind of forgot about it after a while. Well we were serious and stuck to it. I was 160, she was 140. At first, her goal weight was 120, mine 120 too. Basically The Diet entails that we stay under our BMR...way under...around 500 kcals a day. There's some misc. rules, such as hardly any carbs, lot's of protein, minimal fats, vitamins. At first we knew the consequences...now we've seemed to have forgotten them, each day, she says ""there's no visible consequences, it's worth it"" and I nod and agree. I went from 160 to 148 in just 3 weeks of restricting. I've been doing it for a long time, but I've been yo-yoing. The Diet seems to bring out my binging side, and once I binge I can't stop for days. I'm at 153 right now, and honestly plan on being 110 by summer. She does too, but she's 112 right now. And it's taking a toll on her health. She's passed out and hit her head and had to get stitches. She's cold all the time, her immune system is depleted. And, even though that's happening to her, I can't help but be jealous. I see her, and I see skinny. Thigh gap, flat stomach. But it's not enough The Diet mentality makes it so it's never enough. She still sees fat. 

Not only that, but The Diet makes me depressed as all hell, and I've started cutting again. My grades are going down the shitter, my every waking thought is consumed by calories, what I'll eat, what I won't eat. I haven't started purging. She has though. 

Part of me knows that it's not just a diet anymore. Part of me knows that I'm beginning to get a disorder, and she has a disorder. We promised we would rat eachother out if we get too out of control, but...I can't. Because then she'd rat on me, and I still have weight to lose. I still have so much fat on my body.

I have no idea who they are or what their backstory is. I just easily feel sorry for people. Sometimes to the point of where I'm actually crying for them. 

A few things that trigger me are older couples, bullied people, children, disabled people, etc. Helpless people, more or less. 

I work in a craft store so I see older people all the time buying sewing necessities and whatnot. Just watching them struggle to hold their bags or take money out of their purses and wallets just really makes me sad for them. I always think it must be horrible to be in pain all of the time. It has to be sad to not be able to remember, hear, see, or move like they once could. Fuck, old people make me sad. 

Another thing is disabled kids and adults. People with Downs Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy. Since my job ""reaches out to the public"", we hold free crafting event every month and it attracts a lot of people like this. I, personally, think it's beautiful that these people get to enjoy this little thing but it makes me so sad to look into their future. They may never get married or have kids or travel or whatever. I have a special place in my heart for special people. I want to one day work with special kids but I'm afraid my  ""too much emotion"" issue with interfere with my future career. 

It's so bad that I actually cried in a drive through line. I was waiting for my food and this person came out with a child (about 2-3 years old). He was holding a balloon and this balloon was the greatest thing ever to this kid. He accidentally let it go and he started crying. You could tell that this kid was devastated. It tugged at my heart at how much this kid was hurt. I even shed a tear.

I became fascinated with vaginas and promptly started reading/learning everything I could about them. Down the line this has turned into a full blown obsession with pleasuring women. During sex I no longer care if I even cum as long as they do. I've perfected my skills to the point that several women have told me they can't even masturbate themselves as well as I can for them. The negative part to all of this is that I have become obsessed with sleeping with as many women as possible simply for the fact that all vaginas are different and I want to experience as many as I can. Sadly this has resulted in me stacking up a rather embarassing list of previous lovers that kind of eats me up inside a little. I always wonder if I'm some kind of freak...

   	There are so many things I want to say to you everyday. But there’s no place to start. No where to end. No way of breaking this cycle, this continuum that has stretched us so far apart.  I’m sorry I made you cry the other day. If it makes you feel better (karmatically anyway), you make me cry all the time. 
     	I’m surprised to say this. My hands tremble as I type this because I hope it’s true, and if it is, then I’m sad it’s come to this. After years of decay in our once pristine relationship, I don’t need you anymore. Please don’t look back at those pictures of yourself as a lonely, motherless girl and see me. It’s not as bad, but just as true, and what’s done is done. The last thing I really want is for you to suffer. We stand, not mother and daughter anymore, but sisters. Tied by blood and sacrifice. And we belong to the same sorority of suffering. 
	I’m so sorry you never had a mom. That you never had anyone to braid your hair. That you never had anyone to dance with you, make you cookies, or tell you that you’re a gift. I feel lucky because I had that with you at first. I had you for ten good years.  I wish I had known when I was ten that it was over. I don’t remember the last time we spent together without this aching pain somewhere in our relationship. I would’ve treasured it. And although you’ve been selfish and have destroyed my trust, I miss you. 
	For years I was just waiting. I waited for you to come out of whatever it was you were in the middle of. Waited for you to come back to me. Waited to be able to talk to you again.  So many times I would try, tentatively, to reconnect. To heal the deep wound our distances has caused me. But whenever I’d reach out, there was no hand to grasp mine. There was no caring. No laughter. No talking. I was just alone. Reasoning with a stone wall. It’s been ten years. And it doesn’t hurt as badly anymore. But it still hurts when I think about you. That’s why I don’t call. That’s why we don’t talk. That’s why I don’t stay over when I come home on break. Because it’s painful every time.
	This letter isn’t about blame. That’s why (hopefully) you’ll never read it. It’s about being honest. It’s about saying the whole truth. Saying that I miss you. Saying that I’m sorry for wasting the time we had together. I was a child, and I had no idea. Saying that your past isn’t unimportant to me. That it hurts me everyday to think of all of the things that happened to you. Saying that through everything we’ve been through together, and everything I’ve gone through alone, you’re the only person who’s truly broken my heart. And although I know I will eventually heal, and the pieces are regenerating and reconnecting as we speak, it’s hard to believe that I will ever be whole again. 
	I’ve spent the last ten years experiencing and coming to terms with our separation. The last five years have been the hardest for me. I still needed you. I needed a mom. And you were so starved for one of your own that you failed in being mine. I can forgive you for that. I always have. But I’m here to say that it’s over. I’m no longer interested in a real relationship with you. I no longer need a mother. I hope there is a God, and a Heaven, if for no other reason than that I want to see you when we’re gone. I want to be with you when we are both absolved of pain. When we know the peace this life has denied both of us. But until then, this is goodbye I guess.
I love you Mummy.
I’ll be seeing you.
Love, Sweet Pea

I was a nonbeliever as far back as I can remember. My family went to church every Sunday (not only on holy days of obligation like most Catholics I know) and I went to catechism twice a week. Luckily, my parents couldn't afford to put me in the Catholic schools. One day at catechism we were required to spend 1 hour of uninterrupted prayer in the adoration chapel by ourselves. Our teacher stood just outside the chapel where he could hear and make sure we were praying. Our teacher was a priest in training. (I forget what those are called.) He was attractive. He was about 20 I'd say. I would fantasize about bending him over the altar and  lifting his vestments. The ""sin"" of the thought excited me. I often wanted to shout ""bullshit"" during class but would fantasize about blaspheming with the priest instead. When we had confession with him, which shouldn't have happened because he wasn't a priest yet, I'd get a raging boner and would fondle myself knowing that he couldn't see me in the confessional. The day that we went to the adoration chapel I was about 12. I'd had him as a teacher for 3 years. I was in mid prayer when I started thinking about him. I stood up and let my pants drop to my ankles and started masturbating and fingering myself. I came during the lords prayer which got louder and louder as I neared climax. This was also the first time I think I actually made semen. It went every where. I cleaned up all the semen with my sock, some of it having went on the giant crucifix in the center of the room. When I was younger (I started waking it quite early) I would masturbate to Jesus's rock hard body. I even once used a crucifix as a dildo. I don't have a religious fetish though. I was just a really horny kid with a vivid imagination. When I wasn't in church I never fantasized about doing it there. When I was in class I fantasized about doing it in class. When I was riding the bus I would fantasize about doing it on the bus or in a car. When I got a computer Jesus was no longer the hottest guy in the room. But I guess the most ""perverse"" fantasies were had during those long hours of catechism.

What ensued after this point was basically everything short of fucking. He teased me, ate me out, made me come so many times that neither of us could keep count. Things would have continued if I hadn't started getting sore (and tired..).

There was 2 black girls, 1 chubby latino, 1 ugly white girl and 1 10/10 white girl.

Anyways, it's always very easy to score cocaine at the bar on the other side of the street so I went there. When I come back I find out that my friend, who is in a relationship with a very hot and very smart girl that has a good job, is gone with the 10/10 girl. Oh well, I'll just go with the chubby girl then. Fast forward to 2:30 am, I'm very drunk and high on cocaine. I haven't seen chubby girl in a while, and I see a new girl who is even hotter and 10/10 girl (which I will later learn that it was the same girl in a different outfit).

So I jump at the occasion and we go in a cabin. I'm too high to get hard so I tell her I just want a few dances. I ended up doing some lines with her, eating her out and kissing her. (OMG WTF WAS I THINKING).

On the way home I found out it was the same girl that my friend went with. The only difference is that he fucked her and he came in her mouth.

We talked for a while until about feb 2012. Then everything fell apart when she got a new boyfriend. 

She deleted me off Facebook (and blocked me), even though we had stopped talking. The last thing I sent was a joke, before that, I was wishing her a happy valentines. She thanked me with a smilie. 

I had her on Skype for a while, and I guess she deleted me but didn't block me, as I could see her online when she went to use it. One day I decided to message her. After a while, it went blank, and I'm certain she blocked me on there too. 

Why blocking me? Who knows. I never did anything forward. Only general chatting, or saying hello. We had kept up friendly for a long while before that. I never got the impression she wanted to stop talking, or that I was annoying her. She would always ask me how things were on my end, and was excited about stuff in my life before that. 

I look through her pictures once every couple of weeks. It doesn't help, but I miss her a lot. 

I can tell she's not with that guy anymore. Seems it was a short lived relationship. I'm fairly certain she's single now. 

I tried sending a text about a month ago. Just saying how I hope all is well and would love to hear how she's doing. It went instantly to *read*. So I don't know if she saw it, or if she changed her number. No response. 

I really want to talk to her. But I don't know how. I keep hoping I'll run into her one of these days, seems like she goes to a lot of the bars I used to. Also, her work email is readily available online, but I think that's a step too far.

    4. Where superiority complex comes in
    5. Where sexism comes in
    6. Enough is enough
-----------------------------------------------
^1.
I'm engaged to a wonderful woman and am starting to come to terms with some very fundamental limiting beliefs I hold, including sexism that stems around our gender differences, as well as a superiority complex. Let me explain.

^2.
**Personalities:**
    *Me:* extroverted, relies heavily on my intuition, in touch with feelings, obsessed with my perception/diagnosis [ENFP](http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFP.html). 
    *My fiancée:* more like an [ISTJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISTJ.html) personality.

^3.
**Example situation:**
I catch myself having a one way conversation when I want to discuss something I think is important. Fiancée becomes stressed and is incapable of speaking her thoughts or feelings without becoming upset. Sometimes I have empathetic body language and things to say, other times I sit stoically and cold in frustration. I believe she has low self-esteem but my concern is I have worsened it in my behavior whenever she asserts her opinions or feelings.

^4.
**Where the superiority complex comes in**
If I'm honest with myself I realize that I often think I have the best answer/opinion, a ""superiority complex,"" which is a precursor to insecurities I likely have. My reality must be heavily reliant on trusting my intuition and stubborn skepticism of others' thoughts and opinions. This applies occasionally to other men but largely women in my life.

^5.
**Where the sexism comes in**
I treat women and men differently -- I accept more thoughts/opinions from men because they challenge my complex with confidence or argument, and also because I more often understand how men think. Whereas for women, I doubt them more because most women do not challenge my ""complex"" through argument; women are trying to share a discussion, not win an argument right? It is one thing to consciously understand this -- but unconsciously? **This is where reddit comes in.**

^6.
**Enough is enough**
I refuse to subject my fiancée to this stuff and wish to seek help. Why settle for topical treatment (conscious efforts) if there is a way to attack the root (unconscious changes)? I think I need a therapist or hypnotist to fundamentally alter these limiting beliefs.

So, the mother I once had is ""dead,"" her grave is the body of a manipulative, delusional, abusive woman who tried her best to ruin my childhood and tear my family to shreds.

After I lost my job, I couldn’t afford my most basic living expenses and I needed somewhere to go.  With much persuasion, you convinced me to move back to Chicago, and live under your roof.  I sold everything that I could, my car, all of my furniture, my guitar; I would have even sold my motorcycle, if I didn’t owe more than it was worth. I was grateful that you had allowed me to use your credit card so that I could rent a moving truck to come up here and I more than paid you off for that expense. When I got here, I immediately started employment, faster than I could get my State Drivers license, it was Starbucks, it was horrible, but I needed some sort of income to pay you off. I continued to help you around the house; I did MORE than enough for you. I took care of you through your surgeries, hell I literally wiped your ass once.  Months went by, I got a much better job working as a Legal Assistant and now you started to charge me rent money; on retrospect it wasn’t right. I have paid you $500.00 a month for over three years all I have is a bedroom, you never once provided food for the family and actually you more than one occasion ate all of my food. The rent although was bad, and I would like to remind you that not once have I EVER was late or missed a single payment. I continued to help you with things you needed around the house, often I’d clean house, take care of your dogs, maintain your yard and even run errands for you from time to time. A few times I was even charitable, you don’t even remember the time I paid off your mechanic for that brake repair, transmission flush or how about the numerous oil changes that you needed help affording. What is worse is you are a completely self centered person and since I have been back with you all I have seen you do is shop at expensive department stores and go out to lunch/dinner with your friends. What is worse is you are always defensive about everything in your life and you have been lying to me. From day one, I was never supposed to be charged rent money, I was only paying you back on your loan, and then it somehow evolved into rent. Now that you are going through a divorce with my soon to be Ex-Step Father, you are planning on me sticking around and helping support you all over again in a new living arrangement for “the family”. I choose not to be leached on any further. I am writing to you because of last night. I know for a fact, you constantly lie to me regarding the smallest things. I asked where you where when you came home late, I already knew that answer was “dinner and a movie with my friends”. Do you want to know how I know this? You Share Your Google Calendar information with me. Where you told me you happened to be? Working. Why did you lie to me? Why do you use my money, why aren’t you helping me grow as an adult? I am supposed to be the person who is financially stable enough to care for you when you grow old, and I seriously doubt that will ever happen. When your divorce happens and your house sells, I won’t be living in Chicago anymore, I plan on moving back to Florida, and I am not for sure if I can be around someone one who doesn’t respect her son but only suck him dry and lie to him.

It goes like this:

So a guy is digging for treasures... or in real life I am putting my spoon into my cereal and eating it. The brown cereal is dirt. The goal is for the guy to dig up rare ""stars"" (star shaped marshmallows). Unfortunately he runs into ghosts, lightening, and bats instead of stars. I kind of think of that as losing, like in a video game. When I get the star, I win. So here is what I have to say in my mind when I get each marshmallow (I apologize for the stupidity of this.. but I don't know what else to do with this strange confession):

lighting bolt ""AHH! a lightening bolt!"" (imagines electricity noises. guy dies and fails.)

ghost: ""AHH! a Ghost!"" (hear a ""booo!"" I lose the ""game,"" but don't really die?)

Bat: ""AHH! A bat!"" ... no real imagination with that one.. accept maybe some flapping.

Star: ""ooooo! a star!"" He has found the ""gold"" and has won the game!! This will make the boss happy!

And it is ESSENTIAL for me to end my last bite of cereal with a star marshmallow. there is no other way. The thought of ending with something else just makes me feel totally uncomfortable.

perhaps they should make a real video game out of it, Idk..

Edit: spelling (probably more where that came from)

I am on a man binge right now.  I think this is because I know deep down that I am a lesbian, or at least that is what I want to pursue right now.  I am making up for it with a lot, lot, lot of unnecessary entanglement with cute boys.

I just spent a weekend with a guy from out of state who I've had a bit of a long distance thing with, who knows nothing about my other boys.  He doesn't even really know much about me.  I don't really know much about me.

I get off on the power of being paid for sex.  At the same time, it is becoming draining, and I think I might stop soon.

Perhaps I am trying to drown my worries in casual sex and concerns about trivial relationship things.  I need to find a job soon AND move across the country, both things that I have made no solid moves on.

I am beginning to feel like too much of a liar; I am playing with too many peoples' hearts at once.  

-B
-E
-N

plus multiple other people who have expressed interest.  I am discreet with my hookups, no one knows about anyone else. 

I approach sex unemotionally and enthusiastically.  I tend to do first, and think about whether it was a good idea later.  I get off on making boys get off, sometimes against their will.  I like nothing better than seeing a light kindle in their eyes, and knowing that I'm making them infatuated with me whether they like it or not.

No one in my life knows about all of the men I'm involved with.  Only me.  The secret gets to be too much lately.

I used to be a fatass from age 8 onwards. I've toned my body and am now in stellar shape but I have fucking scars all over my skin. You literally cannot find a spot on my lower torso - front, sides, back - that doesn't look like it's stitched together like Frankenstein. My stomach skin is still saggy.

Being a fatass, I was never once asked to dance, never was approached by a girl, never had the balls to ask girls out. My secondary school experience consisted of hearing about my friends experience their first kisses, first loves, first hand-holdings, losses of virginity, etc etc. Sure, they all broke up eventually but they still remember those times fondly, while the only thing I remember is wearing a jacket during summer because I was too ashamed to show my manboobs in public.

Fast forward to senior year of college. I'm now in very good shape but I think being involuntarily celibate for so long has taken an impact on my personality and behavior. I try to flirt with girls but it's like I have an aura of repulsion around me. They usually force conversation and then move away quickly at parties. No girl has ever willingly been alone with me in any context.

I think this is because not experiencing teenage romance has severely fucked me up in the head. I get depressed and frustrated at myself, thinking about how my first sexual experiences will probably not be that meaningful to the girl in question. The sense of exploration is gone. The mutual nervousness and excitement of the journey together is gone. For the girls around me, it's all about picking up a guy with a tolerable dick and then seeing if things work out for a few months, enough to be in a relationship. Relationships are a factory now. People settle.

I don't want to be someone's 10th or 20th lover. I want to think of kissing and sex as a special thing. I want to share my ""firsts"" with someone who's inexperienced like me.

I try to play it cool. Go and say hi to her, one of my friends is obviously trying to make a move on her. She is acting like she is going along with him just to keep him from hitting on harder, but when I arrive, her attentions turns completely to me. We start chatting, which was more of what I was expecting. Chat turns into a complete conversation, at this point my friend realizes she is not paying him attention so he leaves.

She told me she is tired of standing up, so we have a sit. Never sit down with obvious feelings and booze. Shit goes down.

We sat, and immediatly start talking of the past, and what it could have been. It is all ""casual"", until she screams at me: ""I HAVE TO REMAIN FAITHFUL"". I tell her what is that supposed to mean and she tells me: ""If I didn't have a boyfriend right now, I would have jumped on you the moment I saw you."" Shit. Got. Real. I sat worldless.

You were so funny, nerdy, sweet, and generous. I fell in love with you so fast, you seemed perfect. I was, am, head over heels for you. I still get butterflies in my tummy mixed with the ache of my broken heart.






When we first were together you told me I was perfect, too. You told me how sexy I was and how lucky you were. You told me how I made you completely sexually satisfied, like no one ever has.... But as the weeks went on, you decided I was less than perfect. You became frustrated with me, and started picking at my insecurities. You told me everything that was wrong with me and my body and face.. You cut me deeper than I've been cut in a long time. You started hurting me physically, too. It's been more than once and you don't even pretend to be sorry you did it anymore. You just tell me how it was my fault, how I was asking for it, and how I could have prevented the injury. You're sorry that I got hurt while you were pushing, shaking, throwing, shoving, or grabbing me, but not sorry you did it.
I'm at war with myself. On one part of my brain, I see your side perfectly. I feel like the worst girlfriend ever, and feel its no wonder you explode and treat me poorly and don't want me around. On the other hand, I see me trying to fix myself and help out, and be a better girlfriend, and it gets discounted. You get mad at me for the same stuff you do, and you're so judgmental, I'm afraid you may get hurt if you fall off your high horse.





I'm not sexually satisfied, I'm not emotionally satisfied. Im scared to tell you my feelings and give you criticisim for fear of sparking an argument where I end up with another bruise or sprain or broken bone, or maybe worse this time. I know I'm in an abusive relationship, but good god, you and I when we work, we work perfectly. We can go so far together. I want to hold out for therapy and see if it gets better, but darling, I can't. I'm going to end up committing suicide if I stay with you, I'm sure. I believe all the bad things you say about me. And when you told me that I'm the cause for the lifetime of abuse I've had... Well maybe you have a point. I am the reason. I got you to hurt me when you've never hurt another girlfriend physically.




You are my sweetest, and most bitter, downfall. My first love, my greatest weakness. The man who's made me cry the most, and who's saved me. The man who throws me to the floor, tell me its my fault you did it and my fault that it hurt me, only to tend to my wounds later, wrecked with guilt, and having me tell you that its okay, don't feel bad. I shouldn't have done what I did, you were right. Oh, god.. I have to go. I really do. It's not healthy for either of us, and I don't want to hate myself anymore. I know you don't understand that, and you probably never will. You never get hurt by other peoples words, do you? You've always had such a healthy self esteem.





Well, I guess this is goodbye. I don't know if i'll ever be okay though. If I'll ever believe another man when he tells me I'm attractive. You told me how only teenage boys and drug addicts find me irresistibly sexy. I believe that. But I would rather be alone than with someone who makes me feel like I'm twelve again. That was such a dark and depressing time for me, and the only connections are, I was being abused then and it was ignored and I'm being abused now, and I'm ignoring it.





I love you is not enough, but God, do I love you. This is hard. Harder than when I quit meth, harder than anything I have ever done. I feel like a failure, and that I'm walking away from the best thing that has ever happened to me... But you're also the worst and I can't fix you. 



So, goodbye, my love. I'll miss you so much it'll be a physical ache. I'm not sure Ill get over you, but I'm only 19, so I probably will. I hope you get help, and fix whatever is hurting you so much. Maybe, someday, when we're both healthier, we can meet again and it'll work that time, but I doubt it.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_158v3l,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/158v3l/to_my_sweetest_most_bitter_downfall/,

I do not believe that race, religion, sexual orientation, sports team preference or favorite ice cream flavor has any effect on anything besides the color of their skin, who they like in bed and which god they do or do not pray too. I don't give a flying flipping flap about it. Stop making such a big deal out of it. (this isn't a confession, its more of a preface for later statements)


2. I believe politically correct bullshit only further emphasizes that we are different. ""Oh shit, that guy is white, I have to call him European American and be sensitive to the fact that his skin is a different color."" It's a constant god damn reminder that I am different from him and he is different from me. You know what I should say ""hey dude, how's it hanging."" To which he should make a wise crack about his penis. Hilarity ensues. Stop worrying about this and stop bitching about terms for people. Humans are humans, fuck trying to figure out names that ""correctly and politely"" explain their differences.


3. Progress is slow, stop whining that its not fast enough. Gay marriage. Guess what non-homos, its GOING to happen. Get over it and stop bitching. Guess what homos, its GOING to happen. Get over it and stop bitching. A mass population is like a child, you have to let it come to its own conclusion and mature. If you try to force it to mature, you just make it fight back more. Anyone that has ever tried to feed a child vegetables can attest to this. Full human rights for all people is a vegetable. It's healthy, we need to eat it but by damn a lot of people are going to huff and puff and cover their mouths. Guess what, those people are mostly OLD and will die. Right now you are pissing off young people, the ones who will be voting over the next few decades.


4. Religion. The only reason to EVER tell me your religion or your religious beliefs is if I ask, which I most likely won't do. Don't look smug atheists, some of your bunch are just as bad if not worse than the damn religious types. I don't care about your lack in belief in god. I simply don't care. You are as ridiculous to me as a religious person and the more you talk about how dumb religious people are the more dumb you look to me.


5. STOP WATCHING FUCKING BAD MOVIES AND BAD TV PROGRAMS. They keep getting made because you keep watching. Then you fucking bitch about how bad they are and start watching when the new season debuts. Think a remake will be bad? Then why the fuck are you lining up to pay 12 bucks to fucking watch it and bitch. You are just feeding them!


6. On that note, why the fuck are people always talking about how awesome tv shows or movies were when they were kids compared to today. Guess what, you were a kid and stupid. I don't care how awesome he man was when you were 8 and how nostalgic you get when you watch it now. If you tried watching that shit for the first time ever as an adult, you would hate it as much as you hate everything made for children today. I mean really, have you seen the shit you used to watch? I remember how awesome ninja turtles were, I totally smurfed with the smurfs, but guess what, they were fucking awful shows. Honestly, I'd rather sit with my kid and watch spongebob at this point than some old turtles episode.


7. People should be required to take tests on parenting before being allowed to have children.


8. Pot should be legalized, taxed and force to display the same hazard type warnings as cigarettes.


9. Suicide. Just fucking do it. Stop threatening.


Either you are serious about it then you disgust me. Have you seen what suicide does to a family? To your friends? Don't care or think that no one likes you. Fine, gene pool is better off without you. Sound harsh, too bad. You think your life is so awful? You think you have it so much worse than everyone else? Well maybe you do. Maybe your life is shit. But guess what, there tons of people who are living your life, have lived your life and dealt with your shit. Guess what, some of them bitched, some of them slit their wrists and some of them nutted up and dealt with their shit.

You think my life was easy? You think that guy next to you on the bus had an easy life or all the other kids in your class. Guess what, some of their lives are great, some of their lives suck. Deal with it or remove your pathetic ""I can't manage"" life out of my gene pool. I give a shit about the future of this world and you are tainting it.

Chemically imbalanced. Yeah that sucks, get out of my gene pool. A lot of AMAZING talented people who have changed the world for the better have been chemically imbalanced and dealt with that shit. You think I don't know what that's like? Try me.

If you aren't serious and need attention then jebus claus this is the most pathetic disgusting attention ever. You wouldn't be more pathetic if you threatened to shoot up a school. 

Suicide is not funny, its not cool, its disgusting and pathetic. It RUINS families, it HAUNTS your loved ones and friends for years. It's one of the most selfish and awful things you can do to the people that care about you.

Now i feel guilty having any sort of friendship or leaving home for anything besides work or school for fear of being suspected of doing drugs or whatever.

Never mind the fact that i work as an intern for an aerospace engineering company. It's always going to be the same.

 Just earlier this week i was invited to a bonfire by a few friends, and the first thing she does is tell me that maybe i shouldn't go, because there might be alcohol, and that she doesn't trust me.  I know these are people who don't drink and are basically kids who have the same classes i'm taking now. I don't have any intention of drinking or doing anything of the sort at all.  What she said just brings all the waves of guilt back, and it makes me feel like shit. Nothing i say will make her think otherwise. The irony is that she asks me why i have no friends, and why don't i do anything outside of school.  It makes me want to just curl up in a ball and die.

It all started about 10 years ago when I was still young and realized that it wasn’t that hard to find girls online that wanted to chat about sex. So, instead of watching porn I had cybersex partners and we did some online roleplaying and I didn’t think much about it back then, but as the years went by I realized that I was never satisfied. I always wanted more and more, I was always on the lookout for new girls to chat with and the things I wanted to cybersex about kept getting more and more disturbing. 

It all reached a breaking point when I realized that I would actually kill myself rather than do the things I would cybersex about, it ranged from rape to incest and everything in between. I don’t know why this happened; I guess I was just bored with normal cybersex after all this time so I kept pushing the boundaries even further. 

I’m suffering from something called post coital tristesse, which means that I feel sad after ejaculating and I think this is one of the reasons why I got hooked on cybersex as well. Because after ejaculating I always wanted to be alone, and that made cybersex really convenient because I could just turn it off when I was done.   

This addiction is extremely time consuming, I could spend entire days doing it and always feel horrible afterwards, knowing that I’m wasting my time and my life with a habit I don’t want to keep. Cybersex can’t be a part of the life I want to live, I want to be married with children and not to lock myself in a room in front of a computer for hours on end trying to find some emotionally disturbed girl I that wants to pretend that I’m her parent/master/rapist/etc. 

I’ve tried to stay away from it for months but I end up relapsing if something though happens. Like if something goes wrong with a girl I’m seeing I turn to cybersex for comfort, to know that somewhere out there somebody wants to have sex with me. 

I want to end this on a positive note though, because of this I can last really long in bed, which I like, and some of the girls that I used to cybersex with became  real life sexpartners, so it wasn’t all bad, but now I want to move on to the life I really want to live. 

**TL,DR:** I was a cybersex addict for 10 years but now I’m trying to quit. I got disturbed by the things I used to cybersex about and decided that enough is enough.

I remember the first time it happened, it was around the time I was in 1st grade and my parents had a party with a pineapple.  I couldn't get enough, the citrus was amazing I just wanted more and more until I finished the entire thing and my mouth was raw. When I was growing up at my parents house I couldn't really get my own lemons so I settled for extreme sour candy, besides that a few times a week I would sneak a cap fulls of lemon juice in the middle the night. I would actually add water to the lemon juice to cover my tracks, seems so ridiculous now. Used to think that it must be similar to being addicted to drugs; I wondered ""doesn't everyone have these urges?"" can I sell lemon shots and get other people hooked? Of course it wasn't long before I realized that the whole thing is weird.  I've done everything to hide this habit, sometimes the people I'm living with will find lemon seeds or wonder why I buy so many lemons every week.  It didn't take long to figure out it was easier to be sneaky than to explain.  After college, when I had a job and more freedom it got really bad.  I figured the purr orgasmic bliss of salt and lemon, you dip a lemon in salt and relish it. I can feel the chemical reaction in my mouth just thinking about it.  Fast forward and I'm in my mid 30s and I limit myself to 5 lemons a week. Sometimes it's more or I'll go through cycles of binging followed by withdrawl.

When I was 20 years old I had to get circumsized. Not because I wanted too obviously. I was born with ( as far as I am aware of) extremely tight foreskin. When I say this I mean it wasnt until I was 20 years old that I had actually seen the tip or whatever. So of course not really knowing there is anything horribly wrong with myself I was sexually active and it wasn't until I was with this one girlfriend. Things were really messed up, but i got called over for a booty call like thing and we decided to go at it. Big mistake. For a couple years I had never had a problem. Well mid fuck I felt something rip. It hurt like a son of a bitch. When she asked what was wrong I just pretended like it was a cramp and just went on. Well it really hurt, but I stayed hard and I finised. Pull out, head to the bathroom to now check things out, and I panic. Like a inch and a half or so rip and blood, everywhere. I freak out, she says it could be her blood cause I may have hurt her inside. Fuck no it was me. Anyway I decide I need to see a doctor about this cause I never want it to happen again. After many bookings, and appointment I finally see a doctor. He figures it will happen again. So i decide to go through with the surgery. I never told any of my parents about what happened and the doctor said it wouldnt take long to recover, so I think I can do this. I get a couple good friends to take me to and from the hospital, its not big deal. Go in and the doctors make me feel at ease and put me out. Bam I wake up feeling fine, they load me up on painkillers and away I go. Gave me T3's btw. So I am taking these things when I am supposed to and feel fine. However it is like 12 hours after and I have a reaction to the painkillers. I start vomiting violently. After puking for what seemed like hours, and trying to have a little water to keep hydrated, my friends decide to take me back to the hospital. I feel barely concious. So weak from all the vomiting, people want my name and address there and I thorugh my wallet at them. My friends figure they can't do nothing for me so they call my mom and tell her to come. Fuck, now she has to know. They tell me to never drink if I am having a reaction like this, just let it all out and try eating in a day or two. In the mean time they give me something to calm my stomach and also give me some much needed nutrients. I am so drigged out by the time my mom comes by that I don't realize what we are talking about. She asks what happened, and I tell her about the circumsion. Says it is okay, but why I didn't tell her before. I responded with the worst thing ever. ""Mom, derpina and I were fucking and it ripped okay?"" The look on her face will stay with me forever. No more questions were ever asked again. One of my most awkward stories of my life.

My birthday is on the 5th, her's is on the 6th. We live in the same city with our respective spouses and we had been planning on celebrating our birthdays together. We were sitting around, talking about what we wanted to do when I offhandedly threw out that my wife and I had a groupon to a rather expensive restaurant. It was just an idea, but it's coincidentally my wife's favorite restaurant in the world, and my sister knows it.

My sister and her husband are hard working but they're a single-income teachers'-wage household with two kids. I know that they pretty much live paycheck to paycheck as it is and that going to a restaurant where you'd spend $125/couple would really be a stretch.  However, my sister insisted that it would be ok. I felt badly about it.

Shortly afterwards, my mom announced that she was coming to town and wanted to come to dinner with us, which was more than fine. When my mom asked if there was anything that I wanted for my birthday, I told her that I wanted my sister and her husband's half of the meal to be covered. 

The big night comes and we all have a wonderful time. My mom insists on paying the entire bill, which I had a feeling she might do, but it was certainly not what I intended. My sister, oblivious to the arrangement I had worked out with my mom, begins to protest and my mom replies, ""relax, this is your birthday present!"" At that point, it completely dawned on me that my actions put in motion a plan that made it so that my sister didn't even have a choice. I chose her own birthday present for her, from start to finish.

I feel horrible. My dad is a big-time manipulator and I'm becoming very self-conscious of any behavior that I exhibit which echoes this.. I really didn't mean for any of that this to happen.

He's my best friend, a good man, but I'm not even sure I want a man.

I'm a coward and a lazy piece of shit.  If not for him, I wouldn't even wake up when I'm supposed to, get some breakfast to eat, or get to work on time.  I'm thankful for that, and I love him for that, but my biggest fear is marrying him and realizing years from now that it's not what I wanted.  I can't take time back once it's gone by.

Our sex is not fulfilling.  I'm dreadfully kinky.  I have a massive bondage fetish.  Vanilla sex cannot get me off.  God, I hate myself for this.  I feel trapped in my own sexuality.  All I want is to enjoy sex and intimacy like normal people do.  If I could change anything about myself, it would be this without a moment's hesitation.  But, I can't.  I'm stuck with this.  After years of trying to explain, he sort of knows what I like, and he'll do it for me, but I have to beg and barter for it.  I don't blame him for being bad at it.  It's not his thing.  He's never going to be a natural dominant. I'm always going to have to stand there and tell him what to do.  I'm never going to know a true submissive role with him.

But like I said, I'm a coward.  I'm afraid to roll the dice. I live in the Bible belt.  The s&amp;m community here is very small and steeped in shame and secrecy.  The odds of me finding a suitable partner, who I love outside of the bedroom like I love him, are astronomical.  I already spent years trying to explain my desires to my partner and I don't want to have to face starting over.  Please understand, it's very uncomfortable and  baring to sit in front of someone you want intimacy with and have to explain what kinky shit gets your rocks off.  It's embarrassing when it turns into a goddamn psychology lesson.  Every funny look, every failed attempt hurts deeply and you can't show it or else the whole show stops.  Why does it have to be so complicated?  Holy fuck, I wish I were normal. 

And I know I prefer women.  It's taken me years to admit that, but it's true, it's so fucking true.  I look at lesbians in porn and I crave the soft, pretty curves of a woman so badly.  I like his hair long because sometimes I close my eyes and just nuzzle into it, pretending.  I hate myself for this, too.  All I have to do is marry him and I'll have a nice, normal looking family.  I know pride is on the rise but I've already had my ass beaten once.  I remember the blood and the pain and my mother's sour face.  It's hard to let go of the fear. I don't think I can.  

Sometimes I want to just pack up and leave.  I want to go somewhere far away from here where the LGBT community and the leather community are alive and thriving. Maybe the girl I want is out there. But honestly, I don't think I can keep my shit together on my own.  I don't know what it is in other people that keeps them motivated to do things, but I don't have it.  On the days I don't work, I sometimes don't even leave the bedroom.  My roommates make fun of me and they should, but it hurts.  They don't understand what it's like when the world outside becomes stale and unappealing.  

I went to a bridal open house.  We watched a wedding fashion show and it just hit me hard.  I don't want to wear the dress.  I don't want to be the bride.  Later, we had sex.  He was trying to make me come and I just shook my head.  He knew what it meant.  While he was cleaning up in the bathroom, I just laid there, wondering what the fuck I am doing.

Well, I have a confession.",crazyjavi87,22,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1aftju/so_this_is_a_first_time_im_doing_this_well_i_have/,"Reaching out to complete strangers on the internet. Heh. For starters, I hope no one I know see's this. 

I'm twenty-one. I'm a student at BCIT, and graduated from two years at VCC, have good friends, and a happy family. So what is there to confess?

I'm alone. I have good friends, but deep down I want them to shut-up. I have a good family, but they can't get their shit together. Each day I put on a fake smile, I lie, and pretend nothings wrong with my life and worry. Worry about tomorrow.

Worry about what going to happen to me, and my family. Each passing day my mom slowly becomes more depressed with this failed marriage of my dad and her. My dad is an asshole who cares more about himself than his wife, and lies constantly. We need to pay rent? Shrug it off, say he has no money, and have my brother come home from Calgary after a month and tell him he has a savings account with fifteen thousand dollars in it.

Which brings me to my brother. My brother is a genuinely nice guy. Blunt and rough, but a good guy. He has great friends, and tries to do the right thing when it comes to my family but gives bad advice, and, like everyone in this family, adds fuel to the fire when there's an argument.

Then there's me. The cheerful, lazy twenty-one year old hoping to get a job in IT after BCIT. The cheerful guy who has an inferiority complex towards his brother who's better than him at almost literally everything. The cheerful guy who keeps everything to himself and just smiles so people don't have more to worry about. The one who worries constantly about his school, future, and family at the same time. 

The one who feels he's always alone because almost everyone he knows is better than him in every way. I'm not a good person. People tell me I'm a good person. I'm not. I lie every day, I'm a terrible student, and I constantly ignore things that don't involve me directly. When I was younger, I was bullied alot. But I'm sure alot of people have been through that, probably worse then me so I never complain about it.

But it's the fact for almost my entire school-life, I was compared to the significantly smarter older brother. Wherever I went, he would be there doing better then me no matter what. My teachers would compare me, ask why I wasn't like a student like him.

My mom would say stuff like that in an argument when she got angry, but took it back after things calmed down, but it remained in me all the same. I went to a different high school to escape it, it followed me. I went to an entirely different route of life, it followed me. My friends know about this and try not to do it, but sometimes it slips and it upsets me. But all I do is smile and say it's okay. It's okay.

It's okay. Always with the 'It's okay.'. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of saying it. I'm tired of lying about it. It's not okay. It's never okay. I fear each day for tomorrow. But I don't have anyone to complain to, or tell my worries to. 

All because I don't want them to worry. So I made myself into the cheerful guy who never get's upset or angry. Who always smiles, who hasn't a care in the world.

I wonder what would happen if I was never here. Maybe my brother would've gotten his shit together. Maybe my mom, and dad wouldn't have been arguing this much. These thoughts, always at the back of my head, have been slowly increasing over the years. Even recently, I feel that I'm slowly breaking apart. Just barely holding myself together in order to move forward.

I have no dreams, I have no aspirations.

I'm a liar, a coward. That's all I really am.

But even so. This liar will keep lying if it'll keep my mom from breaking, even if I break myself. I'll lie, and lie despite how much I hate it. 

That's all I really have to say and confess.

That, and I have a fear of mirrors because fuck mirrors, and I sleep with a teddy bear that I've had for 21 years now.

I embraced their relationship happily, since it also made him happy.

I don't live at home. Now you may be wondering ""What does that have to do with you?"" Well the thing is, my sister and father have been trying to drive my mother nuts... or out right kill her. It started when my mother came to me complaining about her feet swelling, she's older so a little bit is to be expected, but this wasn't normal swelling, this was [lymphoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma) type swelling. She also complained about ""kidney pain"" and about not being able to pee. Well I told her to go to the doctors and get it checked out, because A) I worked in health care at the time and knew that it wasn't normal and B) Swelling happens for a reason and that it needs to be looked at. Time went on and I watched things go missing for my mother... I'd help her look for a roasting pan... only for it to show up 3 days later in an obvious spot, or for her favourite brush that would be found in a really weird place (the kitchen). My father's never been a wonderful man, he's ripped me off of a summers worth of pay just so he could get his car painted (I worked 12 hours a day and he'd tell the guy who was suppose to pay me ""don't worry about that, you don't need to pay him for that.."")

Right around this time I had lost my job working with the deaf/blind (purely my fault, I will admit, though I did take it rather roughly.) I've attempted suicide twice in the last year, I've been trying to get help, but there are things that I can't talk about with everyone, things from when I was a kid. 

There's so many more things, the problem is that they keep putting me in group therapy... I don't belong there... I'm not sure I belong anywhere...

She lives in America, and I don't.  She has a husband and a little baby, for god's sake.

We've known each other for about a year from mutual online friends, but started becoming really close about six months ago.  At first we were just really good friends, and then the flirting started, and it progressed.

This woman is incredible, and I feel that I love her.  I know you can be who you want over the internet, but there has to be somebody capable of creating that front and fuck, if she turned out to be a fat forty year old guy I reckon I'd love him a little bit just for creating such a beautiful facade.

I feel huge amounts of affection for the kid, and I like the husband from what I know of him.

The woman and I dream and talk about everything, and it feels incredible.  I won't go into the topics, but I love them, and she loves them, and I love her.

Recently she pulled back from the overtly sexual stuff - pictures, dirty talk and all that - and I completely recognise that as the right move, though I wish I'd been the one to make it.  No, that's not right.  I wish I wish I was the one to make it.

I actually said that we had to stop a little while back, though I forget my exact reasoning.  We started talking again, of course, and it soon got back to close to peak emotional highs, though without the sexual aspect.  Because damn it I feel strongly for her.

We know it would be a bad idea to meet, at least whilst we haven't got these feelings under control, and so have no intention to - it hasn't even been seriously discussed, it's just not what would happen.

At no point do I feel I have been manipulated, and I consider myself no idiot - but if I were manipulated I'm not exactly sure I'd know, and clearly this love stuff throws a good deal of rationality out of the window.

Though in almost all walks of life I am very harsh with myself, I barely seem to think on the rights and wrongs of all this.  It makes me and her very happy, and it feels like we operate on our own set of rules (delusional, self justification).

If reading this makes you think I hate myself for it, and so really I'm not happy with it, that's not true.  I am, however, hugely conflicted, and know, really, deep down that it is the wrong thing to do.  The idea of the husband finding out is unbearable, though I don't think he would for a good while yet.  Fuck, just imagining the kid having to go through this.

I knew I was at the time, turning every other conversation into me talking her down simply just to make her feel bad. I don't know why I did it, maybe because it was easy. Maybe because, like most abusers, it made me feel powerful since with a few words I could turn this girl, this girl who I loved at the time, miserable. And like a lot of abuse-es, she didn't leave me.

Sometime i could feel a little voice in my head telling me ""You don't need to do this. You don't need to hurt her or make her feel even worse."" but I blatantly ignored it.

I truly felt as if I loved her, she was the one girl who could make me happy at the thought of her, and I knew I could make her happy too, but that I could also toy with her.

Just like the innocent voice telling me to stop, there would also be a different voice telling me, urging me, me to just all of a sudden tell her the truth about the kind of person I really am, just to see the expression in her face. To tell her ""I don't actually love you you dumb cunt, you've just been a toy for my amusement."" and then laugh about it. It would be during times when I would be comforting her and making her feel better, and that urge to say ""I don't actually care about you."" stone cold to her.

I dunno, I'm having a really hard time explaining the feeling. And it's only been with her that I felt that way. I felt as if I was two different people: The one side that loved and cared for this girl, willing to do anything just to make her happy, and then the other side who didn't really care for her and even manipulated her on a number of occasions.

My mother told me that when she was pregnant with me he pushed her down to the floor for money. I don't understand she didn't leave him then. When I was born, I was quiet ands observing. I pretty much stayed like that.

I always loved drawing for as long as I can remember. Writing, too. When I was in kindergarten I drew mermaids for other kids and quickly got deemed ""the artist"". I hated math, and throughout all my school years I doodled feverishly in class.

My parents always fought. But when I went to school, I would forget about everything going on at home. It just blanked out of my mind. My father always stole anything of value, and it was 'normal' albeit painful. I still don't understand how a man can steal and sell a child's Disney movies, game systems, television, lamps, family heirlooms. 
Anything you can imagine that held value was sold. The only thing he contributed to the 'family' is cooking skills and a 600$ disability check at the end of the month, much of which would go on drugs anyway.

 It wasn't until middle school that I started to realize I was being abused. The sound of a belt buckle still scares me to this day, no matter how docile the environment around me may be. My mother would try to protect me, but she's fucking stupid and still didn't leave him. He would beat me if he thought I was talking to boys (I wasn't). I was sick in bed with a fever and he beat me for money. The bathroom was a great place to lock myself up and hide, but eventually the door would be broken down and I would be beaten even worse. I remember looking at myself in the mirror, my boyfriends black shirt torn at the collar,  blood on my forehead, my eyes puffy and my cheeks covered in tears, my hair in disarray. I was the typical image of abuse against women. I'll never forget. He choked me once to the point that I blacked out and fell to the floor. When I came to, I couldn't even remember my name or who I was. That peaceful moment of unknown made me more accepting of death.

In middle school I had lots of suicidal friends who cut themselves daily. I didn't blame myself for the atrocities I'd suffered, so maybe that's why I didn't join them. Those kids were my family. I have never had a closer group of friends since then. 

My father would befriend my friends parents and then borrow money from them without me knowing. He would tell the neighbors I was in the hospital and he needed money to get me. If family members asked where my new gameboy was, I would have to say I lost it. I can't recall how many times I used the ""I lost it,"" excuse. I was broke all the time and couldn't even afford a quarter for lunch. The lunch lady was never kind to me about it. I have had to hang my head in shame many times.

I had a high school sweetheart. It was the happiest I've ever been in a relationship. It was romantic, adventurous, compassionate, spiritual, fun and positive. I can die happy knowing I was once so very much in true love. However, I will always feel guilty about how I attained this love. I broke up with a close friend of his in order to date him. I know that this led to the greatest love of my life, but I will always feel like a bad person for putting someone through something so traumatic. It is one of the most fucked up things I have ever done.

When I started college, nothing changed. My father sold my camera, but he also sold the laptop that all my work was saved on - 12GB worth. A whole year of photography, my first year, gone. Pictures from high school - senior trip, prom, old middle school photos, all of that was gone as well. Mementos I will never be able to bring back.

My mother is a real piece of shit. I told her that she had to kick him out or I was leaving. So, during my first year of college at 19, I moved out to live with a new boyfriend in the projects in Manhattan. It was beautiful living near Central Park and being only 20 minutes away from Times Square. It was amazing living with someone who loved me, too. We were both depressed and would spend endless days locked up in his bedroom smoking pot.When I go back to visit, I still feel as if I've finally arrived home after a long journey. I would cook for him and give him hand and feet massages daily, no questions asked. I used to love pampering my loved ones. Perhaps I still do, but I am too afraid to act on the instincts. I can still remember how he didn't appreciate any of it and it hurts.

I was depressed the entire time I lived in Manhattan, because it all finally hit me. I understood that my parents were selfish creatures who were only concerned with their own well being. My own mother had chose a physically and emotionally abusive drug addict over her college bound daughter. I had never caused any trouble. I was a quiet kid, never got detention, never even got into a fight, didn't have to repeat any grades in school. What did I do so horrible to deserve to be tossed away? When I did see her, she would call me stupid, dumb, idiot, moron - no matter how successful and intelligent I was. 
The pain of all my past gnawed at me that entire year. I avoided visiting my parents for most of the time that I lived there. When I finally did go visit, my father was high within a half hour. He couldn't even stay sober for me for 2 hours after not seeing me for over 6 months. 

Now, I am living here again, with them. I had to leave Manhattan and break up with my lover because not only did he betray me, he constantly took me for granted and I knew I deserved better than that. My mother is never nice to me. Both of them have let me know that they wish I wasn't born and that I am nothing but a burden. They let me know in middle school that I was supposed to be aborted. 

Luckily my father has nothing left to steal from me. I sleep nearly on top of my iPad and iPhone. I take both wherever I go - even the bathroom. I have no choice. I am still an artist, but I don't believe in myself. My lack of confidence is the biggest thing standing between me and artistic success.
 I have a natural talent and I don't know what to do with it. Still, I am happy to be an artist. Art is the one thing that is always there for me when everyone in my life fails. Reading, too. When I read, I am engrossed.

He's losing his mind, too. He yells at people who aren't there. He fills out a log book of the voices he hears and the interactions he imagines. It's scary and I hate living here.

I'm losing my mind, too. To depression. I don't have the motivation to find therapy, though I'm trying my best to break out of it. I also don't have many friends who I can truly confide in. I am the person many people come to for advice and support, and yet I get none in return. Its my own fault because i do not ask for help when I need it (because I am used to rejection and people being selfish). 
Luckily, I met someone this year who is quickly becoming a close friend. Our lives are parallel in a few important ways, and it's comforting beyond belief. We talk nearly every day. I have been isolated for what feels like forever. 

I'm dating someone now who I'm not sure about. He has already cursed me out and disrespected me in unforgiving ways despite the relationship being so new. I don't know if I'll be able to forgive that - it's too much of an echo of the abusive past I have already lived. I want a sweet man who is kind hearted through thick and thin. I am tired of trivial arguments and crying. As cliche as it sounds, I don't want to be with someone who is going to make me cry often and not be apologetic about it at the very least.
 I'm also convinced he isn't attracted to my entire body. He's used to beautiful white women, and although I'm a 'beautiful' latina, my large hips just don't compare to the sleek thin physiques that are so popular. I'm not even overweight and men compliment me all the time, but the insecurity is there regardless. So, I don't know where the relationship will go, but I do know  he makes me happy in a big way. If he didn't have a mean streak, things would be perfect.

I have so much more to write than this, but this is already way too much. It's crazy because I've left out so much. There are far too many memories to write. There's a lot that I wish I could forget, too.

It started after we put my little brother to bed. 

He said that he wanted to show me something, got out blankets and put them on the floor of the living room, and told me to lay down. I being the curious person I have always been, and having always enjoyed learning new things totally bought it. I laid down, I think he told me to take my pants off and my underwear too. He began by gently blowing air on my penis. It was cold and felt great, unlike anything I'd ever felt really, and began to get erect (as erect as my little penis would go, at least). He kept asking me if it was ok, if it felt good and I kept saying yes. We never kissed, and I never touched him, just laid back and enjoyed pure new sensations. He eventually sucked me a little bit, lots of fondling. He also showed me his penis, ""because he felt bad"", I said I didn't really care and he showed me a little bit. 

At some point when I had made it clear that everything felt super good and was really excited about it (I even wanted to wake my brother up to show him these new amazing things (and feel awful about that)), he told me that I couldn't tell my mom, or we wouldn't be able to do it again. 

At this point I realized that there had been a terrible misunderstanding, but didn't know how to get out of the situation in the best way, so I just went along with it. 

I tried to avoid mentioning anything as long as possible, until my mom said that he should babysit for us when she needed to schedule another sitter, and I said that I would rather not (until then he was our favorite sitter), and told her what had happened. She kind of flipped her shit, we went to the police, and there was a hearing but I didn't go to it. I know my father was even more pissed, and pissed at my mom for letting it happen and everything. 

The weird thing is that I don't feel bad about it at all. I enjoyed myself and if it were a normal part of growing up I think that that would be completely fine. I consented and enjoyed myself at every point, and really enjoyed being shown the new possibilities of sensation by someone who seemed to know what they were doing. I wasn't ""raped"", and I never really felt taken advantage of, and I could have stopped it at any point. 

The thing is that despite my ""consent"" it has fucked me up a bunch, but only because of how molestation, and child molesters are portrayed in society. How it somehow represents a failure of my mother's, or the police or something. How I really should feel terrible, and taken advantage of, while just a powerless little child. I know this might seem ridiculous but the worst part came from telling my mother. If I had known what I know now, I would have kept it a secret so we could keep doing it, **fuck society**.

DISCLAIMER: I also want to make it clear that I am not in any way trying to condone his actions or promote child molestation. I know that my case is not usual, and that it is usually much worse/less consensual. I would never attempt to recreate this with a child, or even consider that. I like older men and women from a broader age range.

Scratch that, I see a therapist and take psychiatric medication, but other than that, no one. Also, I see my therapist maybe once a month due to money issues, often times once every two months.  

I withdrew from most people a while back because after trying to talk to people repeatedly, I noticed that no one really cared about me that much, and that is was mostly just me trying to keep in touch. Since withdrawing, I haven't really had anyone keep contact with me. I deleted Facebook, double also because I couldn't stand looking at pictures of myself. 

If you knew me in real life, you would never suspect this about me. I constantly joke around, and repeatedly take on extra responsibilities to keep busy. On top of my double major in Physics and Biology, I'm working two jobs, teaching myself the guitar, and exercising daily seven days a week.

It's whenever it's all over and I'm alone with my thoughts that I can't tolerate anything. 

I'm aiming for a PhD after undergrad, just to further keeping busy. I can't relate to most of the people around me, and often feel like people just abandon me after getting to know me better.

Not in some fucked up way, like for masturbating or laughing. I genuinely look at the shit on there and, except for the ones that are stupid or fake or just a woman covered in shit, empathize with the subjects. 

It really kind of feeds me emotionally and psychologically. When I see these people going through or dead as a result of these horribly gruesome things, I feel as though I am paying my respects. I am not spiritual at all and am an antitheist, so please do not mistake this for ""spirituality"". 

I experience the most sincere and authentic form of emotion in my life while browsing this subreddit. I feel as though I ""get"" to empathize and to ""pay my dues"" to these people who suffer for whatever reason. I don't get a lot of this form of emotional expression in my life, and for things as drastic, life-changing, and irreversible as some of the stuff on spacedicks, I am almost FORCED to feel the most extreme form of empathy for these people. They were people who didn't choose to live in some fucking third-world country, who are probably better/stronger people than me. And yet there they are, suffering from an electrical burn that has destroyed their entire lower body, or a disfiguring crash. I don't see a lot of things that are authentic and deserving of such extreme forms of empathy and human emotional response in my privileged life. So when I get the opportunity, I feel for them. Because they deserve it. 

Also, I feel that my observation of their conditions make them more righteous, if you take my meaning. They were goddamn working to feed their family, for fuck's sake. Now they're dead, and there are seven billion other people who don't give one single thought about it. I think of all the suffering in the world done by those who don't deserve it and who go unrecognized. Whose suffering has meant nothing because nobody has/can see it. And it makes me sad. Deeply, truly sad that these people will never be remembered, and that their lives are forgotten so quickly. It seems unjust to just let someone become forgotten like that, and that is why I watch /r/spacedicks. 

Because in some weird way, I feel like I can lessen their pain, or serve them in the way their death has earned them. I feel too much empathy for people to just let their lives fade into memory and become forgotten. I need to make sure another person on this earth sees them and remembers them, especially how they died. So that they don't just disappear into the eternal past. 

Maybe that's kind of egotistical, but I  feel I am successful, if only in easing my own pain in knowing that this shit happens all the freaking time.

It's a long story

So, I had a friend, let's call her V. We were friends since middle school, and I just graduated high school. I thought I knew her, but I guess there was a lot she wasn't telling me. She told me that she's a pathetic, and terrible person, but she never told me why she said that. I didn't really know about things she's been through. She didn't want to tell me. I accepted that she had her reasons, and moved on. We continued to be friends. My friend, another friend showed me an app that gave me a new number to text people from, and I'm sure a lot of you have heard of that app. At first, I was just going to mess with her, because we always joke around a lot with each other. I knew she would think it was funny, but then I got curious, and took it too far. I told her that I was carlos, a guy that went to middle school with her (that I know of, there wasn't a carlos at that school). She has memory problems, so she could believe that there was a guy that went to that school named carlos. I told her that carlos was an old friend of mine. I asked her as carlos why she couldn't tell me the truth. She just said she didn't want me to dislike her for who she really is. She ended up telling me (as me) she's a self harmer, and has been for a long time. She never told me that. I couldn't tell her the truth. It was fucked up of me to keep this up, but I did it anyway. We haven't seen each other in maybe three years, because of certain reasons. We would talk everyday through text, but at one point before all this happened, we fought for the first time. I can't honestly remember what we were fighting about, but she said some hurtful things. She said my lack of belief in god is ""stupid as fuck"", and just other things. I've never seen that side of her, and she really isn't one to be particularly close minded. She said she just can't talk for a while, because she was moving to a different state for college. After two months, I asked if we can talk again, and we were talking regularly again. A month after that is when I made up carlos. I wouldn't text her all the time as carlos, just some times. On saturday, I confessed to her that carlos was made up, and it was me the whole time. She was furious. She told me I was her last hope for society. She said when she met me in middle school, she was afraid of me, because she was scared to be my friend in fear that I would hurt her. Not in a physical way, just in friendship. She said that she could never hate me, but she can't be my friend, or trust me again. V told me that I'm not the kind person she thought I was. She then told me again she's the most pathetic type of person, because she takes things very personally, keeps grudges, doesn't easily forgive, and that she hates people. Just so many things. She hates herself, she hated that she trusted me, she thinks god must hate her for everything she has done (I don't know anything she's done), that she can't trust anyone, she blames me for her going to be alone forever, she blamed me and said she can never trust anyone again, and it's my fault, she wishes she could hate me, then the very last message was her saying she'll try her very best to forget about me, and to have a nice life. Before the last messages right after I told her the truth, I said that she doesn't have to forgive, because what I did was very very wrong. I feel like a terrible friend, and person. I wouldn't normally do this. I think she over reacted to an extent. At this point, I feel like I didn't really know her at all. She said that she loved, and trusted me, yet she couldn't tell me certain things, such as the self harm. Out of all the people she's ever known, she should've known she could tell me that, because I used to self harm, and I've been through a lot, and have mental health issues. I'm a little hurt. I know that she's hurt. After that first fight, I accepted that we may not be friends at some point, whether it be sooner, or later. I don't know why I did it. It was a shitty thing. I considered her my best friend, because I felt that I could tell her what's on my mind. I could be silly with her. I just messed everything up forever. I just hope that she one day realizes that not everyone is out to hurt her, and I just really wish whatever she has done, she can forgive herself, and move passed it. I really do wish nothing, but the best for her. Before all this, I saw her as this funny, creative, yet kind of naive person with certain things. I told her some things I never told anyone.

No parents, just the two of us.  Life was perfect.  We hung out, but gave eachother the needed space too.  Chores were fun, since we'd do them together.  Parties were fun, we share a lot of friends.  And most of all i felt truly happy in my house for the first time in a long time.

Then came the girl.  This girl started off as a one night stand.  She walked in with my brother after a night of drinking downtown.  The had their one night stand, whatever, that doesn't matter.

Fast forward to octoberish.  He's now seeing this girl, purely because of the sex (at first).  I don't know anything about her at this point, so I don't mind too much.  They end up getting to the point of dating soon enough, and now she's around all the time.  I can deal with this.  He's happy, and it's none of my business anyway.

But now we get to December.  She has now moved in.  I was not asked, it simply happened.  She dominates the main room in the house with her presence, I find myself spending as much time as possible either in my room or at my desk.  

It's not an issue of her taking up space though.  She's insufferable.  She's SO FUCKING ANNOYING.  I can't stand having more than a 5 minute conversation with her.  I can't stand her being around.  It makes me so annoyed.  And now I live with her.

She's a slob.  but being my brother's sex toy, it doesn't matter.  He'll get angry with me for doing something the wrong way in the house, or for missing a chore or something, meanwhile she doesn't do SHIT other than cause a mess.  Now, for doing the exact same things that I do, but in many cases worse, he doesn't say anything to her.   She makes a mess, she leaves the bathroom horrifyingly dirty, she doesn't wash her dishes, etc etc.  she's overall just a horrible roommate, but it doesn't matter for some reason.

Add on top of this she's inconsiderate, and this trait rubs off on him as well.  I don't expect much, considering I do my best to avoid her, but I at least expect my food to be in the fridge if i leave it, I expect my desk to be clean when i leave it clean, and i expect my things not to be touched.

I'm unmedicated outside of occasional recreational drugs.

When people get close to me, I tend to think they've become pussies. 

I don't respect people close to me unless they treat me like crap. It makes no sense except that I was raised to be this way via my upbringing.

I have very bad mood swings and I hate the world when I'm in them.

I don't believe in God, but sometimes I like to think that malevolent demi-gods fuck with lower life forms like me by hiding my keys when I need them.

I haven't said ""I love you"" to my mother in 14 years. I probably won't ever until she's dying.

I've been preoccupied with boobs since I was a child. I am a female, bisexual twenty-something. I really want to squeeze some nice boobs (other than mine) but never had the chance.

I have exhibitionist tendencies but I'm too ashamed to admit them.

I'm weirdly fascinated by incest stores (yes, I'm going to check out r/incest).

I fear I am that insecure, negative, crazy person that most people don't respect. I also fear people thinking that I'm a slut or perverse (even though I'm probably not compared to everyone on the internet).

When people tell me I'm pretty, often I think they're saying it just to be nice.

If I'm out and about, I almost always think of ways to avoid dangerous situations and serial killers.

I have very bad paranoia and will cover some of my tracks even if I'm confessing on a confession forum.

Interestingly, I have an almost fetishistic love for other people's secrets.

People here aren't as obsessed with holidays as Americans, and it's such a breath of fresh air.

I worked at a big computer retailer as customer services. Being here means that I handle returns. Started off with a USB stick that was opened, nobody noticed it gone after a week. I was in high school and worked right after so I brought my bag which had my dinner. Used it to steal stuff and worked my way up eventually taking laptops.

Then it was time for stock take and alarm bells went off and they vamped up security. One night they decided to do a random body check and that's when I got busted for something of very little value. Fired on the spot and got taken to a police station under that one item but they must have known it was me. Few days later I get a call from my ex-employer saying they found my ebay account where I sold all the stuff I stole. Said if I'm willing to pay $30k in damage they won't report it to the cops. I don't know if I actually stole this much but it was definately $10k+. But it put a lot of pressure on the family to pay it and had to borrow money from family friends. Don't know if they know the truth or even whether my siblings know.

After a few weeks I tricked my exchange student staying with us into giving me money over the course of a few weeks. I had used a key logger on his computer and accessed his bank account to send money to myself. Then I would tell the student that I need to withdraw money but can't because parents are checking my account. I would show him me transferring money(originally his) to his account, then get him to withdaw it for me as cash. Reason this kind of worked is because his parents gave him a lot of money and he never kept track of it. After a while he told my parents he thinks hes missing money(whether he suspected me or not I don't know). Parents confront me and I confess. Parents tell the student it was a banking error and corrected it by transferring money back to him.

Few weeks later I got several big bags of cashew nuts and labeled them peanuts(you write the code on a label) to get cheap cashews. Casually told my parents without realising who told me to stop.

Somewhere along the time line in between one of these events I occasionally stole money from parents wallets. After a few times they started commenting out loud that they appear to have misplaced money and I realised how obvious it must have been and stopped. They must have known but never confronted me about it didn't last long.

Needless to say after each event excluding the last, I had serious talks with my parents and only after the third time did it really start sinking in. Many years later, never stole anything again. I feel quite horrible about all over it and never spoken to anyone about before. 

Motivation? I already stated I was just young, stupid and didn't really think. But if I had to have one, with all the money I had, as a SAP I got moderately popular just for owning all the trendy gadgets and this made me feel beter about myself. Decent car, made it look nice with rims etc, paid several thousand to replace my sound system with amp and sub woofers etc. Several ipods when they first came out, 2 laptops, psp, expenssive watch, you name it.

Weirdly enough, the exchange student I mentioned is meeting me for lunch before he leaves the country for good. He's also giving me several thousand dollars worth of stuff hes not taking with him which makes me feel even more guilty. While still not knowing if he knows the truth about what I did as we were close, and remained close after the incident.

While she does occasionally have a ""friend over"" (it's an 'open' relationship for her), I turn to the internets. I don't have the time nor the energy for the drama of RL lays and have even turned down offers. 

But there are also my kinks.

Some are pretty regular, but lately, for about a year, I've been acknowledging that I get really turned on by watersports pics and videos. I didn't mention it to anyone. Most of my former online friends with benefits weren't into it, nor was my RL woman. And I was quite ashamed of it. So I kept looking at the videos and pics online. 

I also like to venture onto Omegle and find a female companion there (not by sticking it out at the cam, though) or get anon webcam hookups elsewhere. It's getting harder, but 1 out of 3 times, I'll find a playmate. About two months ago, one of them surprised me (without my mentioning it) and took her laptop to the toilet with her, taking a pee on cam. Oh wow, talk about turned on... It also made me want to experiment. A few times, I'd drink a lot of water and get off on Omegle or to porn for a while, then played with my pee in the bathtub before cumming. I always felt horribly embarassed. Then, a couple of times, after subtly placed questions, I'd done it into a glass for an anon cam hookup. It turned me on, but also made me feel like a horrible pervert - something I never thought I'd worry about.

Yesterday I sat in my chair by the computer, drinking water and trying to find a fap friend. I held my pee for a really long time, then a girl on Omegle asked me herself (again, too shy to ask still) if I could pee for her. I let a little bit into a glass, then, horny and curious, let the rest of it all over myself, shorts, chair and all. While peeing, I started to tremble as hard as if I were cumming. I did get off and cum afterwards, but it felt very much like the second (and a lesser) orgasm to me. 

I felt so good. But so wrong. I never knew I could enjoy it as much. I wish it would be easier to find playmates. And yet I wish I could not crave it.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_n79wh,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/n79wh/i_never_knew_i_liked_watersports_this_much_d/,

So here's the deal. For as long as I can remember, I've never had a particularly strong libido. Perhaps in my late pubescent growth (17-21) I was more sexually interested. But I'm almost 30 now, and I honestly only think about sex once  a week, at most. I've always been attracted to both men and women, but more instinctively attracted women. However, I have fantasies about men all the time, but never act on them. I've never been with another man, and am quite honestly petrified to act it out. 

Here's my History: I was in a long term relationship with a woman, for about 7 years. We almost got married, but secretly, I never wanted to marry her because I knew I could not get along with a woman for the rest of my life. I find women to have a great sense of empathy and emotional understanding, but I just do not, and cannot completely relate to them. On the other hand, I have this amazing guy friend. Let's call him ""Q."" Q and I have been best friends for over 12 years and I honestly never get sick of him. I can listen him talk about anything forever. I've been there for the best and worst moments of his life, as he has for mine. I've seen him at his best and I've seen him at his worst. We tell each other everything, and it's the closest, most intimate relationship I have on this planet. Realistically, I think I could spend the rest of my life married to this guy. I could spend all day, every day with him and never get sick of him. I have NEVER thought that about any woman. Ever. But I don't really think about him in a sexual way. However, if I had this kind of relationship with a guy that I was sexually attracted to... it would be a no brainer.

So I guess that's my confession. I could very much picture myself married to a man, but I'm too scared to act on it. I'm just not that sexually driven to pursue a relationship, of either sex, because like I said, my libido has a faint heartbeat. But at the end of the day, I'd rather talk to Q, than any woman. And while women are great, don't get me wrong, I've only had sexual experiences with women, I just feel like I don't relate to them. There is a disconnect that I have. There is this gap of not being able to see eye-to-eye with them. And I don't have that problem with men. I am always able to relate and connect.

So what gives? Am I fucking crazy? Are there some questions that I should be asking myself? How do come to terms with this? Is it strange to float in the middle between sexual orientation?

We went to Bermuda and my dad and I had an amazing time. We rented scooters and drove all over the island. It was one of the best trips I've ever had in that sense. My mother stayed in bed the entire trip and cried. One night, it was windy, stormy, and my mother was crying more than she had all trip.

My father screamed at her for the first time in years, then broke down crying because he was so ashamed. She recovered from that too, eventually. Then this year, I made plans with a friend. I got home from school and she said she would drive me. At this point she was completely normal. I took a shower, and by the time I got back downstairs, her demeanor was very different.

She replied by asking if we could stop at the wine store on the way home, claiming that she wanted our advice, but she wasn't going to take it. Her behavior has only become more erratic.

",OhLawdyImmaMonster,27,12,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/15i4yi/when_i_was_16_i_frequently_scared_and_scolded_my/,"I should start this story by saying the kitten part was a total accident.

When I was quite young, circumstances forced me to move in with my father who was a very abusive man. He never physically hurt me, but mentally tortured me, making me feel as if I was no better than a spec of dirt. 

One day we got some cats, and I can honestly say that I loved them, truly adored them. Unfortunately, I am what you might describe as a introverted weirdo, so I never had any sort of release for the anger and confusion that was building up in me because of my fathers daily abuse. Whenever my cats did anything wrong (and sometimes when they didn't) I'd scold them, but part of me would enjoy releasing the anger, and part of me enjoyed having power over something, so I'd scold them for much longer than I had to, usually up to 5 minutes of tapping them on the head when they tried to get away or shaking them if I happened to catch one. I never did any lasting damage or broke or cut anything and would always feel like a monster afterwards and to this day that time of my life still haunts me.

A few months later, one of my cats gave birth to a single kitten. My father left the house to do some shopping, and I decided to play with the kitten. It started out quite playful, but I think I was a little too full on with it as it ran away under the TV stand. I don't know why but some predatory instinct kicked in and I decided to chase after it. I reached in and pulled the kitten out, but it scratched me. At that point my anger flared and I threw it away from me. At the ground.

The image I see when I remember that day always brings tears to my eyes, he was on the ground, screaming and whithing, clawing at everything. I thought he had gone insane, like I'd broke part of his brain or something. I soon realised that I had actually broke his spine. He was dying and all I could do was sit there and panic. I tried to give him water or food, I was panicking, ""what have I done? what do I do what do I do?"". I considered just throwing it away and saying it ran away, but I imagined the neighbours dog finding it and being put down or something.

At this point my father returned, so I told him the neighbours cat got in through the window and chased it behind the television, and broke its back. He told me it was no good and it was going to die, but he seemed to believe me. The kitten had calmed down now, and I sat there as he died.

I have never been cruel to an animal since that day. I have since moved away from my father, and even have two new kittens which I take extra care of. Any time I get angry around them if I'm alone, I just leave.

The fact that I used to be that person eats away at me every time I think of it. I am so sorry.

Thanks everyone. Unfortunately her husband is a HORRIBLE person. He belittles her constantly. He tells her she couldn't leave him because noone else would have her because she's 'weird' and 'unstable'. It is HIM who is weird and unstable... he's a pathological manipulator and abuser. Her life is torture and I fear she will lose her mind.

She doesn't necessarily want to get out of the marriage but she wants him to stop being such a dick. She feels trapped... torn... defeated. She doesn't deserve the horrible way he treats her.

I KNOW we shouldn't be allowing things to get sexual between us.  It's just so difficult when our relationship was sexual all those years ago.  We could have had sex but we limited it to what we did.  A very tricky situation.

It started when i felt more mature then my fellow classmates probably because i technically hit puberty at this age. I would watch adult movies with very sexual scenes and just play the sexual scenes over and over. Then when i was around 11 my dad had left my mom, he was usually on the computer so i never discovered internet porn until after he left. The urge subsided until i was 14 and around that time when i was 12 i got together with my boyfriend (mentioned later) then my sister got her own laptop and would lend it to me for whatever i wanted. I was left alone a lot and enjoyed being alone in my room so it made my obsession easier to access plus i was never bothered. especially at night.. eventually at 15 i got my own laptop and my obsession increased to an average of 4 hours a day because i had school and my mom wanted me to be more social. it increased over the years and now is when i have stopped..

I have been in a relationship for 5 years, my boyfriend and i had a conversation about this and agreed to stop this obsession. But i hate not being able to watch it.. we plan to get married soon and i feel like if i go behind his back and watch it, it will feel like im cheating on him. and make marriage life worse for us both... worst part is were pretty religious, so it makes guilt 10x's worse... 

I hate feeling like this and not being able to feel completely honest about this but i had to get this off my chest...

After about a year and a half of being together, I became pregnant at 18. I've never been more terrified. I come from a family where anything less than a college level education was just unacceptable. And he came from an extremely religious Mormon family where abortion was simply unacceptable. Although he clearly wasn't the poster Mormon boy (he did have premarital sex with me, after all), I knew he'd adhere closely to their religious ideals and reject the idea of me getting rid of the pregnancy. So I consulted a friend. She told me she agreed with the idea of having an abortion for my own future's sake. She was the only person in the world who knew. So I made the appointment and ended it entirely by myself without the help of anyone.

We broke up about 6 months later. I found out through the grapevine that he got married about 2 years later, after getting another (seemingly very nice) girl pregnant. They divorced within 6 months of the child being born. I understand that she may have cheated on him. I felt terrible, but I never told him I was pregnant. I simply was too young and too terrified to be a mother at the time, and I thought I was doing the right thing. And I just couldn't face him with the knowledge that he'd made me pregnant. I thought the secret would just die with me. But he happened to run into that friend with whom I'd confided my pregnancy a few years down the line. In a drunken stupor, she told him how disappointed she was that our relationship had not worked out (we were the ~chosen couple~ in our group of friends) and that we did not end up having the baby. I could only imagine the shock on his face finding out I had been pregnant and hadn't told him. He called me shortly after, and even though we had not spoken in quite some time, and he asked me if everything he heard was true. 

I couldn't lie to him. I did love him quiet deeply at one point in my life, after all. I told him I'd been pregnant, and gotten rid of it because I just wasn't prepared for that and knew he'd have disapproved of my choice at the time. He yelled at me. He told me he hates me now. It'd been a few years, so I wasn't even sure how to apologize to him, for not letting him know, for not giving him an option in the decision.

I feel like shit now. I'm a terrible person for not involving him in the decision, but I wish that he could understand that I was young and stupid and scared and I thought I was doing what was best for both of us. I wish I could live that period in my life over again, so I could tell him. Even if he disagreed I probably would have made the same decision but at least he would've known, and would not feel like I'd cheated him out of a child he may have wanted. I'm so sorry. 

It hurts me more than anything to know that now we don't talk not because we lost touch, but because he hates the choice I made without him. I'm so sorry.

There is nothing really wrong with me. At least, I don't think so. I used to date as much as my peers when I was a teenager and even had a couple fo long-term relationships in the later part of my teens.  But it has been that long since I last went out with a girl on a date. I am now in my early thirties. 


I'm a fairly old-fashioned person. I don't like one-night stands or fooling around. That doesn't mean I'm a social pariah - far from it. I get along fine with women (if I had to say, I'm a bit above average in the looks department, I dress well and tend to be pretty well versed in conversation. And ocassionally I do engage in low-level flirting with women around the office or at conferences, but it has never escalated into anything further as I just don't let it. If I had to examine my love life, I'd say that I've been asked out 3 times in the past decade, but all three I chose to turn down because I didn't feel comfortable or it just didn't feel like the right time. There was always something preventing me. Work. Family. Travel, etc. It just never seem to be the right noment to jump into a relationship. After a while, I started to avoid it just out of habit.


It's funny how one day you wake up and you realise an entire decade has passed you by and that horrible sensation that *another* decade could roll by and you wouldn't feel it because, well, you're now *used to it*.


But I do get lonely, you know? There are nights, like this one, where I sit back, take stock of my life and realise that deep inside, I am very lonely. That I want to have someone to share my life with. That my home is just too big for just one person, and that I would love to talk to someone about my insecurities and my doubts and my silly urges. But I just can't bring myself to do something about it, you know? I don't know how to even do it anymore. And when it gets really dark, when I am about to drift off to sleep, I briefly wonder if I'm going to die alone. And part of me thinks that Yes, that's probably the case.

I've (19M) been driving for 4 years now. I've always loved driving. Been driving lawn mowers, go-karts, dirt bikes, anything that had wheels, I'd drive it. I loved driving. I wouldn't speed more than 3-4 MPH over the speed limit. I worked on cars constantly for fun. I loved the feeling of being behind the wheel with a 300hp engine and the windows rolled down blasting anything thats on the radio. Loved it. 

1 month ago I was on my way to my new job (been working there for 2 months at this point). Its about a 45 minute drive from my home to my work. I'm driving in my brand new (new to me) car that I just bought 1 month ago. Couldn't have been in a better mood since my birthday was a weak ago. 10 minutes out from my work I take a right onto a country road on the peak of a hill. As i start driving up tot he speed limit (55), a large SUV comes speeding up behind me. He was riding me so close I could see nothing but the grill with the FORD symbol on it. Honking and reving the engine at me, I was fuckin terrified. I ended speeding up because I was scared he would of hit me. (keep in mind this country road is single lane, with a dip on both sides. Eventually we hit a straight away so that the asshole could pass, which he does. Stunned by this I stare as he speeds off. Next thing i know, I look into my mirror with a cop with his lights on behind me. I am releived on the idea that the cop just saw all of this. NOPE. He pulls me over, doesn't believe my storie, and gives me a ticket. (69 in a 55).

Ever since, I hate drive. I'm fuckin terrified of getting a ticket. I'll start driving home and I'll see a slight glimmer in my mirror and end up slamming on the breaks because I feel its a fuckin cop. Even when I have the cruise on and I'm 5 under the speed limit, I still freak out and slam on the breaks at every vehilce thats a cop or somewhat looks like one. Doesn't matter if its pink, if its a the same shape, I still freak out. That 45 minute drive has turned to absolute hell. I'm taking a little over an hour to take that same drive. I'm now that incredibly slow asshole who nobody's likes. I'm that person I always yelled at in my car. I hate it. I hate is so much. I avoid driving at every chance I get. I feel like my heart has been ripped out. I'm just hoping that it'll get better as time goes on. But so far, there has been no sign.

I'm 19 M and I'm a simple guy with few friends and one best friend(we will call her Mary) I've had for almost 3 years now and a GF I've been with for a year and some change. I have always had a thing for my best friend because she helped me through a past relationship with her former female best friend that ended badly and caused them to stop being friends.   
  
So back to Mary's dream. She text me after about a month of us not talking, due to my busy schedule, she told me about a dream she had a few night ago about us hang out like normal then suddenly we were making out and ended up having crazy awesome sex. I was shocked to hear this because I never thought she would think of me like that (She has a bf that she cant stay away from like one of those of and on again relationships) but she told me that the dream keep replaying in her head and so after more talking and joking about the dream I remembered we are going to a concert in a month in a half and I had asked her if she could still take me like she had said a while back. She then asked the one question I found kind of ironic, 'what do I get if I do take you?' So me being me I said 'well what do you want?' she then slightly blew my mind saying all she wanted was for her dream to happen. I was speechless due to me having the feeling for her I have always had. Then we proceeded to talk about our feelings about each other. Then we decided we should find a place where we could 'make her dreams come true' (yes I know the pun was bad) So this is where I get caught up because we are both in faithful relationships, except I don't agree with hers due to her bf getting her hooked on drugs (I do them too but she does one I don't agree with, but I still don't judge her) and we both agreed to keep it a secret for the sake of our relationship.  
  
So is it bad that we are doing this? if not is it bad that I would want it to become more? and finally a side note I forgot she has a baby (she's allergic to latex) that I love like a nephew   
  
Thanks for your time and any and all advice is welcome  
  
TL;DR My Best Friend had a dream about us hooking up and wants it to happen and we are both in relationships.

It seemed like the perfect place, small fenced in back yard, spacious rooms, garage, washer/dryer.

Well finally, I had enough and reported him to the city housing unit; turns out he never actually registered the apartment. I've been an illegal tenant for some time now so I immediately retained a lawyer and started looking into my options. It turns out he lost his job, lost his main property (who the fuck buys a multi-million dollar property on $100,000K a year?), and is barely staying afloat on this property. By reporting him, I essentially sealed this property's fate as foreclosure as the only way he could not have this foreclosed is by renting which I've made it impossible to do as the city inspection revealed close to $30,000 worth of repairs/improvements needed before it could be considered up to code.

Aside from my last confession about caring too much for strangers, I've come to realize that I'm completely opposite to people that I actually know. 

Long story short: my best friend's friend just had a miscarriage. My best friend called me tonight and told me the news; completely a mess. She's also pregnant and was so upset that I instantly thought that she herself miscarried.  That I would've cared about. 

I felt no emotion for Theresa (best friend's friend). I literally did not care that she wasn't going to be a parent anymore. She was pretty far along. Twenty five-ish weeks I think. She'll have to deliver a dead baby tomorrow and I give zero fucks. 

That shocks me because I'm actually a mother and I couldn't even fathom losing my own son. 

I feel like maybe I should feel a little remorse for her since we are technically friends, if you want to call us that. 

I guess it's just that I know her too well and that she's not ready to be a parent. She's barely 20, lives with her boyfriend who still lives with his parents. She lies, steals, ridiculously childish, drinks like a fish (while pregnant) and actually to be quite blunt: she's a massive whore. I don't mean that in a cunty ""chick on chick"" rant kind of way; she's actually a whore. For example, which while still in a relationship with the jerk off that impregnated her, she introduced herself to an additional 5 dicks in a 3 day period because ""he wouldn't answer his phone"". Then bragged about it. 

Her boyfriend is the same way. He's one of the few people I know with herpes from his own outside flings. Now they both have it and they're ""so in love"".

I just feel like maybe I should feel some sort of sadness for her since I was once in her pregnant state. I feel like maybe it's part of human nature but honestly, I'm sort of glad that she miscarried. For the baby's sake, NOT having Theresa as a mother is the best thing that could've happened to that little nugget.

I'm a few years over 20 at the moment and I've been a huge liar since I can remember.. It really goes way back to pre-school, when I started skipping homework and lying at home that I have none and fake my mum's signature on the notes I got from my teacher. (6yrs old). It's one of my earliest memories.

Well needless to say it all escelated hard during the course of school. I never told my mum the truth about my grades etc (eventho I was never less than a B student), and every month when they had teacher confferences, I had the worst time ever, waiting for her to get home, get the scream-treatment and get it over it. Just to then repeat next month. This went on all trough high school too.

My mum is not a ""bitch"" or anything. To be honest she's cool and loves me a lot. But I always felt like telling her the truth would disappoint her so much I beter make some make-believe to make her proud of me. It wasnt just the grades and homework either.

Needless to say a lot of things escelated over time, I kept building upon a lie until it all crumbled down.

That brings me to my current situation. I was a ""I'm genius, you cant touch this"" to my math teacher in my last year of highschool when we were finishing up grades to finish high school. She did (and now I understand why, atleast a lot more than I did at the time) a special pop quiz for me cuz of that and basicaly made me fail my last year of Math. Out of spite I didn't go fix my grade and up to this day never finished highschool. (I was literaly 1 easy math test away from finishing - If I wanted to finish it now, some years after I'd have a lot more work to do.) Obviously I never told my mum about any of this. I faked my certificates with my photoshop skills, got some fancy paper. Made everything very very belivable. I then proceeded to go to ""college"". As you can imagine I couldn't even sign up for one, and I just spent a year in some other town doing nothing. Living off mum's expenses ofc. While still regulary faking all my college papers and at one point I even sent a photoshoped version of proof of going to school, so my mum could send it to her insurance company and have my insurance covered while I was a supported family member. That actually checked out, and my insurance was dandy.

Years later, I'm living with my mum. She still thinks I got a finished high-school and I attended a year at college, where I realised I'm not made for it. I earn my living by doing webdesigns/webcoding. I dont make much, I freelance. I pay for my internet and weed but thats about it.

I contemplated it for a long time, because my parents said they would get him put down if his behavior did not improve.

I grabbed a bottle of antifreeze and filled the dog's water bowl about halfway. He drank it right up and I held him as he became progressively inebriated and eventually the life slipped out of him. I clenched him tight, saying to myself ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" over and over again. ""You'll be in a better place."" I told him, more to comfort myself rather than the dog, if I'm honest.

It will just feel good to have someone read this since I don’t have anyone around here that I can talk with.

I’m almost 30 years old. I love my girlfriend more than I can find words to express. She is awesome and I couldn’t ask for more. For the most part our relationship is awesome. I have a steady and decent paying job and work 40+ hours a week. I browse Reddit for about 35 of those. She works from home about 3-4 hours a day. We live together and have for a while. I pay for most things since I make far more than she does.

A few years back I did some traveling and I loved every second of it. Every day since I’ve been back I think about going back or traveling somewhere new. The people I met, the adventures I had, and the memories I made changed my life. Since being back the thought of travel is with me every single day. The memories have become almost painful. I feel myself becoming down/depressed when I think about it or look at photos. I’m not sure when I’ll be able to get back there or travel. My girlfriend says she wants to travel but says she can’t for at least a few more years due to various things like debt etc. I seriously doubt her want to travel.

I’m really stuck. Both things make me happy. I love both very much but I fear that they won’t ever merge into awesomeness. Living overseas is a dream I’ve had for a very long time.

I’m also bitter about my job. Browsing the net and Reddit most of the day sounds awesome but really, it’s not. I’m jealous about my girlfriend working from home and having tons of free time. At first it wasn’t a big deal but paying for everything is really starting to get to me. I think she is now just assuming that I’ll pay for whatever and has stopped thanking me for the things I pay. Our finances are totally separate if you were wondering.

There are tons of other confessions but we’ll start with this…feel better about it a bit already.

It was all over myspace that night, and at school the next day there was not a single person not crying. People were breaking down in the hallways, unable to walk, broken into pure sobbing and some people had to leave. Every class was silent, he was so popular, no one suspected. No one knew what was actually going on with him, and I didn't even know the kid that well, but he was nice to me, hello in the halls, high fives in classes for whateverthefuck. He was gone, these kids are gone. They're not waiting in some heaven or hell, to me. They're rotting and they're gone. I will never see them again, their voice is silent.

You broke up with your girlfriend a fortnight after we met, a week after we slept together. I told you the worst of me-the varied self harm , the horrible relationships, so you'd understand me. You told me your past, the awful things you've both seen and done. It seemed like we were kindred. I trusted you, though I knew better I was determined to think positive. But that's our difference, isn't it? My past and continuous struggles lead me to value the good so much more, and arse that everything has good. Nothing its so blsck and white as ""bad"" or  ""good"". My harming is not affecting anyone other than me-I'm not stupid, I know it's not exactly heathy, but it is measured and controlled and topical. 
You....chara de mo chroí... You are an alcoholic. You won't admit it. You live in a dark place, a cave that you occasionally come to the mouth of, where life passes by and you can interact for a time, on a surface kinda level, but you never leave the cave. I can't help you, because you don't need help in your eyes. I don't know if you really believe that, because during the binges you tell me the most horrible secrets. I don't know if you are crying for help and then soberly are too ashamed/proud/fucking stubborn to accept it, or if it's manipulation, to make me think ""aw poor you I won't be cross because you have it so bad even though you wrecked the night"". 
We rushed, I know we did. It wa a whirlwind of intensity. The sex was apocalyptically awesome, my body was yours. 
I had to say we should slow down, even though you literally backed me into a corner because you knew I've be scared. But I did. I was afraid, but more of staying than any bruises you could land. I think I also kinda knew you wouldn't hurt me-but it hurt more somehow, that you would want to use that knowledge of fear against me than if you actually had. 
I'm lying here wondering if you're dead or alive, because after all your protestations you text me to say you spent your say drinking. You knew I had a big day at work and still you said that. Now you're not answering you're phone or replying, and I'm not playing this game. Your astounding intelligence (I don't know how you have any brain cells left functioning with the amount of alcohol you inhale, but you are like sherlock and lestat combined) makes me fear manipulation, passive aggressive head games to make me worry. But I still want to think better of you. BUT with the experience I've had with suicide a part of me is terrified you're gonna make a stupid drunken decision, or just choke to death on your stupid vomit. I hate you for doing this because I said to slow down, I hate myself for being naieve enough to be thinking prince charming and love and understanding. So much more...your work, my (admittedly shakey but hopeful) belief in God vs your wormfood, the importance I place in family...holy fuck. Holy mindfuck. You say you won't remove the septic, poisonous one from your life, but you won't talk to your mother about how you feel. You pigeonhole me and my problems, but you refuse to put any kind if label on your own. You are so unbelievably still hurt from your first heartbreak, but you have ni morals. You loathe how you behave, your words, yet if I try mention counselling, a change in pattern, you rear, you fly off the handle saying you're fine. You say you love me, but you're doing what you know will break me. More fool me for bearing my soul to someone I knew so briefly...but...but...what if you're dead? What if you're not.

I feel that it was my fault because I drank way more than I should have, and I shouldn't have been at that party.

Now, anytime anyone says the word rape, I get all defensive, and have been made fun of for it, which makes me feel like a prude and even more worthless. This, in turn sends me into a spiral as soon as I get a moment alone, which leads to lots of drinking, and smoking. Smoking until I vomit and can't talk. And then, my roommate gets on me for smoking so much. All of these things, these coping mechanisms, require more coping on top of the coping, which I know is unhealthy, but I really just want to forget. I also developed a thing called voluntary muteness, which often takes the place of crying. I haven't cried more than about 3 times since I was 13. I just can't. My boyfriend often gets frustrated when I won't talk which makes me feel worse, but I can't bring myself to tell him why. I feel like he wouldn't believe me, or that he would think that I was being overdramatic. This is probably untrue: he's a saint, these are just my feelings.

Fast forward to university, my boyfriend and I have sex - first real time for me. We are both Christians, felt bad about having pre-marital sex, and stopped. Now, anytime we get close to having sex, and then stop, I attribute it to me not being good enough. I've only ever told 3 people about the rape, and one of them I only told that I wasn't a virgin. 

No amount of convincing convinces me that it isn't my fault, and I constantly feel like shit about it. I don't really know what to do about this anymore, but it is eating at me. A friend of mine was talking about a girl she knew that had a similar thing happen to her, and talked about how telling people is the best way to remove the power from the rapist and give yourself confidence.

A few days ago, it was my grandmother's 78th birthday. She's a remarkable woman. She grew up as an orphan in Soviet Ukraine, raised two daughters, put her husband through architect school, and saw her youngest daughter emigrate to the US and live there. When I was six months old, my grandmother came over from Ukraine to help out my mother. She took care of me while my mom was out working and teaching and while my dad wasn't home. My dad died when I was one, and my grandmother stayed in the US to help take care of me when my grieving mother was struggling to stay afloat.

My mom remarried, our little family moved from WI to NC and my grandmother moved with us. My little brother was born when I was six, and my grandmother took on taking care of him too while my mom and first step-dad were away at work. As I get older, I remember more. I always got permission from her to go out and play, she was the one who tucked me in at night and who fixed me up when I got hurt--never my mother. I remember her frustrations at learning English, and I coached her for her citizenship exam, which she took and passed with pride with my help.

My mom got a divorce and moved out, and my little brother, grandmother, and I moved with her to a small house and virtually no income. My grandmother gave us her pension, her foodstamps, what she had saved from baby-sitting, to help keep us afloat. My little brother was stuck in a custody battle and I  was starting my freshman year of highschool. She was at home every day, with a smile for me and genuine curiosity about how my day had been. It seemed like she did everything around the house, laundry, cooking, even yard work--and no matter how many times I offered to help, she would always refuse. She was the one who fought for me when my grades slipped, and she was the one who let me go out and have friends when my mom would have kept me in the house. 

My mom remarried. I now had a second step-father and he seemed as volatile as my mother. They argued constantly, he had already divorced once, and his oldest son had died in a drunk-driving accident, and his second oldest son hated him and constantly ran away.

My mother began to argue with my grandmother too, telling her to go back to Ukraine, being generally mean and hurtful. It got to the point where my grandmother began to hate her own daughter because of the abuse that happened. There was an incident where they got in an argument and my mother squeezed her so hard that she had horrible bruises along her sides. She never breathed quite right after that, and I never forgave my mother for doing it.

As I got older, it seemed like we were at siege, my grandmother and I, by the unpredictability of my parents. We were both at their mercy--we had no money, and relied on them, and we were subject to their every whim. She stood up for me and I stood up for more. I remember my parents talking about sending her off to a retirement home, or getting an apartment for her so she wouldn't ""interfere"" with their ""parenting."" My mother begrudged her the very food she ate to the point of my grandmother refusing to leave her room for days because of the threat to her, and refusing to eat.

Things calmed down as I got older, but I loved my grandmother more than my mother--I trusted her and cherished her. She was the woman who raised me, who cared for me the most out of any other.

One year, about a week after my birthday, I woke up with the feeling something was horribly wrong. My parents had already woken up, 911 was called, and we broke down the bathroom door and carried my grandmother onto her bed. I held her and talked to her, and when the EMT's showed up, I was the one that rode in the ambulance, tried to keep her awake, translated for her. I was the one who stayed with her in the Intensive Care Unit while my mother bawled her eyes out somewhere else. I was the one that read to her and stayed with her alone for hours in the hospital while my mother cowered somewhere else. I was the one who held her hand while her grip got weaker and weaker, and while it got harder and harder for her to talk. I was the one the doctors told when the news came in that she had had a massive stroke and that her chances of survival were next to none. I was the one who stayed up the entire night to make sure that the nurses gave her morphine on time (and maybe, I'll admit now, to be sure I wasn't gone when she took her last breath.)

Where was my mother? Where was the daughter of the dying woman? Somewhere else. Crying her eyes out.

My grandmother died several days later in July. There was a funeral no-one came to, and a burial in the blistering heat, in the red, unforgiving clay far away from the place she was born.

It's been a while, but it haunts me. I've pieced together that morning. She had been awake for several hours before us. She took a shower, and fell suddenly because of her sudden stroke. She hit her head on the sink and her hip on the toilet, and she was probably knocked unconscious.

When she woke up, she began calling out for help, and no-one heard her, nobody woke up in time. I don't know how long she was laying there--alone, scared, half-paralyzed.

And the worst thing was that she wasn't calling her daughter's name, she was calling mine the entire time.

This was the woman I loved the most in this world, and I couldn't fucking wake up. Goddamnit I couldn't wake up. I could have called the ambulance earlier, maybe she would have gotten to the hospital in time...It's been haunting me. I don't know how long she was there, calling my name for help, and I just couldn't wake up. I couldn't fucking wake up and help the one person I loved on this earth.

We met one summer after I graduated from HS but before I moved to the other side of the country for college so it didn't last long past that summer. 

I did nothing with her other than making out and even then that wasn't that often. I was a Grade A idiot. When I look back at it, the amount of times I did nothing was ridiculous. She'd be there more or less stripping in front of me and I wouldn't even try to kiss her, even though I knew that she wouldn't stop me....my brain literally went dead. I never put 2 and 2 together until about a week later. I was just terrified of her beauty to put it one way. She'd crawl up into bed beside me and we'd cuddle but that was it even though again I knew that she wanted more. She even gave out to me a few times about not stepping up but I couldn't seem to, I was that much of an idiot. 

I still regret it even to this day....on the plus side we're both still on good terms with each other and if we're both single when I finish college then maybe, who knows? Although the chances of her being single are slim since she gets asked out about 100 times a day.

The sex is amazing, she is beautiful, etc, but, even so, since I turned 30 I have just wanted more. So I started going on omegle and chatting to other women. Yeah, I had a bit of fun, and found that I was actually pretty good at the whole cyber thing, but that soon got boring. 

Now I have always had a thing for teen girls, so I started to actively look for them to have some naughty fun with. I found a few and had some great one night times with them (online only), but then back in Feb I found one that was really special. She was a girl that was fun, sexy and also a gamer. She liked all the things my SO did not let me like, and not only liked men of my age, she also liked teen girls too. So we became close. Really close. 

It started with the usual cyber sex, then looking at porn together, then exchanging pics (real, verified pics - eventually), then confessions to each other about our darkest secrets, and then talking for hours, wanking together again and again, talking four times a day, and now we are going to probably meet. 

She is 16. 

I am 30. 

But the weird thing is, even though I am twice her age, practically married and have a LOT to lose from this, I just don't care. I want her.

Standard stuff really, just go over once during the day and let their dog out/feed it. (I was home alone in my house next door as well) 

At about 3 PM I went over to their house and let their dog out into the backyard. I had about 15 minutes before the dog wanted to come back in, and I am a fairly curious person, so I decided to take a look around the empty house. After about ten minutes I found myself in the bedroom of the neighbors daughter. I started to look around and leaf through some of the books she had on her bookshelf, when I noticed that her underwear drawer was cracked open. 

Then before I knew it some powerful urge came over me and I was rummaging through her panties. The neighbors daughter was my age, and I had know her for a long time, but I had had never been attracted to her in any way. (She was quite plane, and I had dated more attractive girls) And despite this I was insanely turned on... Long story short I ended up jerking off and cumming in her panties. 

Now, years later, I cant shake the nagging feelings of guilt from this. I have no idea why I did it and I feel terrible. I consider my self to be a very honest and good person, and I try to do whatever I can to help people who need it. Today someone genuinely told me they thought I was a good person, and it just sent me into this spiral of depression (I have a history with depression) because I could not stop thinking about this event. I feel like I totally violated this girl, and that I am a terrible person for doing it.

Ever.,Mysirus,13,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/fbpqq/i_dont_think_shell_understand_ever/,"I met her, two years ago. She had a boyfriend at the time, and when I met her, I was hoping against hope that she was single. An Indian girl; I've never been so attracted to someone outside my own race. I'm not racist, I've just been mainly attracted to my race. She wore glasses, and for me, that's an instant attraction; the fact that that she knew, not guessed, KNEW I played WoW brought me over the edge. It was like...perfect nerd girl meets nerd boy who wants to have real real bad. 

Months went by, and since we were in the same school, we hung out quite frequently. There were only a few days where we weren't together doing something. The fact that I could just lie down next to her, sleep, not to anything, and she would just stroke my hair and play games right next to me. It was like my own personal paradise. She had no idea how I felt, until the night I finally told her.

When I did, it was just me and her, alone, in my dorm. My roommate had just moved out cuz he got his girlfriend pregnant. So, instead of having someone else in my room, I had an empty bed. I told her she could stay the night (we had just gotten back in from hanging out with a bunch of people). As we lay there, next to each other, my iPod was playing all the sappy lovey dovey songs and right then, in the right moment, we both sat up and kissed for the first time.

It was amazing. Her lips were cold, mine were warm, hers were smooth and soft, mine were a little rough and chapped. It was like the perfect match. When we finally pulled back, she apologized, but I told her it was something I'd wanted for a long time. Over Thanksgiving, she stops talking to me suddenly. I get so torn up about it, I end up with my ex for a little while. Back from Christmas break, she invites me over to have some wine. That was the night I learned I hated wine (too bitter for me, not real fancy).

She apologized for cutting me out, basically. She said it was just a bad time that she didn't want me to be a part of. I left it at that; we're in February now, the time of my birthday. She finds out I've recently taken to the liking of someone else, mainly because I was tired of waiting for her to realize how much she meant to me. Then, all of the sudden, everything gets really serious. She tells me she's fallen for me, she's wanted me for so long, and as an added bonus, for my birthday, great things would've happened. I could just turn the other girl away without giving her a fair shot; I turn down the one I had wanted for so long just to try what would be a failure of a two month relationship.

A month later, she tells me that around my birthday, she had broken up with her boyfriend, and had come to me to tell me she wanted me to be in her life in the way we had both wanted for oh so long. Too late. We have remained friends to this day, but she'll never know this.

I love her. I've loved her for a really long time. If she ever wanted me, she could command me and I would do so. I will never turn her down again. If there was anything she ever wanted from me, I couldn't deny her. She thinks we're just as good of friends as any friends could be. She has no idea the power she has over me. Worst part is I'm with someone else right now, but if the girl I loved came for me and told me of how it could/would be if we were together, I know it would be very very very VERY hard for me to turn her away.

She doesn't visit this site, she doesn't know this is me. She doesn't know how much I love her, and she doesn't know how much power she'll always have over me. I would give to go back to that day, to change what I said, and to have given myself fully to her then. I miss the times we had, I miss the love we had, and I miss her presence.

TL;DR: I love an Indian nerdy girl who has no clue that I care about her as much as I do.

**EDIT**
I know it's as easy as telling her, but that's not the whole situation, and I apologize for leaving this out. She's dating a guy she's been with for years, and then I showed up. Even if I hated the guy, I can't just break up something that strong. Not to mention I'm seeing someone myself.

After high school, I moved into an apartment with 3 of my best friends and watched them all cheat on their girlfriends, lie, steal and cheat some more.  I used to be so envious of my friends and the girls they were dating and swore I'd never be that guy.  Fast forward to 10 years later and I'm engaged to a great girl.  She's beautiful, has a great family, a great job - I make good money and she makes 10x what I make and has no problem helping me out.  We just bought our first home; a house I'd never have imagined living in growing up.  The problem is - all I think about is women.  I've cheated with her friends, mutual friends... I've cheated with co-workers, neighbors, her co-workers - you name it.  At a party we had several years ago, I had sex with a best friend of her's in the backseat of her brother's car.  I've hooked up with some of my best friend's wives and girlfriends.  I can't stop, I don't think.  And it kills me when my fiancee brings up other situations like what I'm doing and remarks, ""that's why I love you, I know you'd never do that kind of stuff.""  It's like I'm living a secret life.  I think I've had 5-6 long term sexual relationships (some of them lasting months) during the time we've been together, in addition to numerous hookups.  I find myself perusing the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist, although I've never actually met anyone.  In addition to that, I've taken money from her, just small bits of money, but over and over again for many years, usually to fund dates with other women.  I feel like my whole life is a lie and know if she ever found out she'd leave me.  And I know I need to stop, but I'm so caught up in finding the next girl that I can't stop.  I love the feelings I get when I meet a new girl, the new conversations and how everything is so interesting.  That ""new relationship feeling"" is like a drug - and once I tire of the ""other girl"", I drop her and find another one.  I can't see how my fiancee has never found out, but with each additional conquest, I'm somehow reaffirmed that what I'm doing is right and I'll never be caught.  I'm such a piece of shit.

This is going to take a fair bit of explaining so bare with me. 

I ask Amy out and she says yes. We go out a couple of times but nothing comes of it. A couple of months later we run into each other and get talking. We get really friendly and I asked her out for the second time to be told she was only recently in a relationship (I honestly had no idea). She said that if she wasn't in a relationship she would say yes. So I'm thinking, ''JUST BREAK UP WITH HIM!'' She doesn't. I see it as her picking this guy over me. 

Lets call this guy she's with Mike. Now, I don't know Mike, but naturally I hold a fair bet of resentment. Especially since Amy and I get really close and I start to become infatuated by her. She's just something else that I couldn't put my finger on. About three months pass and she and Mike break up. 

We go out again for maybe two months but I've a lot of shit going on at home and I can't manage to be in a relationship. I can't give her the time she deserves and we just grow apart. 

About 8 months later and I'm hanging out with one a good mate (my best friend really) only to find out she knows him. They're pretty good friends and we start hanging around in the same social group for a month or two. I become infatuated again. My friend finds out she's interested in me. I ask her out yet again, and promise to not be a shit head. She says yes. 

A couple of months into what seems to be a promsing relationship and she becomes close to Mike again. I get upset. I get really fucking upset. What's Mike doing that I'm not? I start thinking about how she picked him over me. I confront her. She explains to me she use to cut herself back while she was with Mike. She told Mike at the time. He started cutting. She blames herself for Mike starting to cut. She tells me they mostly just text checking on one another. 

A year and three months since we start going out and the relationship is going wonderfully. We have our ups and downs but generally everything's perfect. I adore the girl.

So now we're on today. Amy was doing some collecting for charity and she asks a friend (Susan lets say). Susan asks Mike to give her a hand but has to cancel at the last minute. Ends up just being Mike and Amy for a while before I show up to help out. I get upset hearing this. Then she says she was texting Mike saying thanks and what not. 

Now, it's 1AM and I've confronted her and she keeps telling me she's only close to him because she feels guilty for the cutting. My jealousy just won't let me accept this and I don't know what to do. It probably doesn't help she's been the only girl I've had an actual relationship with. I know I'm a selfish prick but I don't know what to do. I need advice. Please.

Would that sense of validation turn into a psychological crutch? Would something even be picked up on a scan at all? What if something *is* there, but the scans don't see it? Would it become a source of frustration, even self-loathing given the recent difficulties?

Anyway, I was out tonight at a musical function, only observing.  My boyfriend wasn't with me and I was one of the only females in the room.  I garnered a bit of attention from the younger males who were around and I fucking loved it.  One came up and told me my hair was beautiful, introduced himself, etc.  Another gave me a cute nickname and smiled and winked charmingly.  I feel guilty for loving the attention so much, but that's not my confession.

The thing I feel worst about is that there was one guy in particular who caught my eye.  He was as cute as could be.  I kept staring at him from across the room and hoping he would glance my way so I could pretend I wasn't staring or give him a smile or so I could let him catch me straight eyefucking him.  And I was eyefucking him *hard*.  He looked very similar to a guy I had a major thing for once upon a time (but it didn't work out), so that made it even easier to objectify the shit out of him.  The fact that he was musically inclined was extra icing on this already delicious man-cake.

So yeah, I feel super guilty because while my boyfriend was at home, I was out actively trying to flirt with some other dudes.  In fact, if this guy hadn't bolted out the door after the event was over, I would've marched right up and talked to him.  Don't get me wrong--I love my boyfriend to death!

I did make one mistake in our relationship, which was not dumping your ass after that first fight, and for that I do apologize. Usually the correct response to someone asking you to spend more time with them is to either apologize for not being around recently or explaining why you weren't. The answer wasn't getting pissed off and yelling at someone who cared about you. How would you feel if every time you said ""sorry I just have a hard time trusting"" I chewed you out for being slow? 

I swallowed so much pride to put up with your shit that it was coming out of my ass. You were the most inconsiderate girlfriend I've ever had. Let's talk about that time I took your weekend on-call (one of the times) so you could hang out with your friend from out of town. And when I was working the desk for four hours, guess where you were? Hanging out with your friend on the other desk. Right across the street. With someone who you apparently just wanted to hang out with more. I'm sorry, but that's just a slap in the fucking face. I'm right down the goddamn street and you don't have the common courtesy to spend time with your boyfriend, TIME THAT YOU'RE SPENDING AT THE DESK ANYWAY, so it's not like you were doing anything important.

 Let's talk about the other time I took your on-call, and the next weekend, when I had my on-call, you didn't even offer to take it. Let's talk about all the time you spend out eating with your fucking friends and you only invited me to lunch twice, even if I hadn't seen you all day. Let's talk about all the times you were studying with a friend, and never once thought that maybe you could have studied with your boyfriend, who would have helped you out and worked hard to help you pass your tests if that was possible. Let's talk about the time you stopped staying over, claiming that you couldn't sleep with anyone due to your ""at-home"" issues, and then you let your fucking friend stay over because he had a bug in his room.

Let's talk about the time you became more and more distant because I was trying to be there for you. Oh, yeah, I forgot, you don't need anyone. Except everyone else that you spent time with those last months besides me. Let's talk about the time your parents got divorced, and instead of talking to me, you went to your other friend, who you had known just as long as me, except, oh wait, he wasn't your boyfriend and he didn't give as much of a shit about your problems as I did.

I did everything I reasonably could for you, but the only thing you gave me was your excuses. ""I don't like to say things if I've already said them"". You think I'm going to believe that bullshit? Who was the one saying three times a week ""I really like you""? Oh, does it just not apply then? Yeah, you had a real immature passive aggressive ""girl"" on your hands, didn't you. Let's just face the facts. I was a good boyfriend who tried to treat you as well as I could, and you were an immature, bitchy, defensive girl who has to text her ex to feel better. And you want to be mad at me for breaking up with you? 

Why are you so mad, because you realize how much you've fucked up? I doubt you ever admit you're wrong, you just get pissy and blow past it.

The whole situation is weird though.  Within a few months of finding this out, I saw him out in public.  He was cruising by in his wheel chair just a few feet from me.  I thought to myself wtf?

What are the fucking odds of this happening.  I hadn't seen this guy in almost 20 years.  I didn't try to talk to him or anything.  Just watched him wheel away into a mass of people.

Is this just another version or something? Using a throwaway. And you can AMA

Okay. So there was this post in r/sex about thinking of murdering when having an orgasm. I thought 'in b4 serial killer get therapey!111'. I have had violent fantasies for much of my life, and I haven't killed anyone, attempted to kill anyone or wanted to kill anyone. But one poster mentioned an interview done with some serial killer called Jeffrey Dahmer.

Anyway, one thing he mentioned was escalation of the violence to human murder. This is the worrying part. I would absolutely not hurt anyone, or feel good about hurting anyone, but what about the future?

I am doing a PhD in physiology, as I have always been fascinated by the body, humans as well as other animals. But it's not 100% innocent. Anyway, here is my little story.

When I was really young, maybe 6-7 years old, I'd be exploring the garden for all sorts of insects. I'd collect these fuzzy caterpillars that I thought were really cute. One day, I just stuffed them all in a jar, practically full, closed the lid and left them there. I don't remember why. But the next day, I opened the jar to find a smelly mess of dying caterpillars. This was my first memory of feeling guilty. It was horrible. No more hurting little bugs because they want to live too. I will help them live. So I made little gardens for bugs, and put all this sugar for ants to swarm. I would rescue spiders from people who wanted to kill them. But one day, I had this urge to squash a spider. I did it and it felt really good. It was unusually good. But then I felt bad for feeling good. It was strange. I called it the 'evil emotion'.

Later, we got a cat. She sometimes caught mice and small birds. When my cat caught a small animal, I'd be shocked. She had some drive to hunt, like animals had some drive to live. I tried to help the small animals, but later on, I looked forward to my cat catching animals, in a way. These animals never let me touch them normally, but if my cat caught them, I could. I tried to catch birds myself. I liked how they were scared of me, and the way they tried to get away if I caught one. I didn't do anything to the birds, other than just hold them for a bit, and feel them trying to escape. I let them go after I had 'enough.' I liked animals, but I also liked scaring animals (easy if they are wild prey animals) and picking up animals that don't like to be picked up. But I wasn't doing anything like hacking up live animals and the like. No way. Probably the meanest thing I did with animals is hold my cat over water, and 'threaten' to drop her in. There are still scratch marks on the doorframe, where she would grab onto when trying to escape, because she became scared as soon as I carried her into the bathroom. I did it because I liked the way she struggled to get away. I also liked it when she bit and scratched me. But I would also feel bad for it after. I'd get her cat treats and catnip, anything to make her feel better, and it usually worked too.

So that's just a few early experiences with animals. Later on, I used to daydream a lot. I couldn't go to sleep, but to help, I would think of a story to daydream in my mind. They all pretty much had some element of violence in them. I was trying to induce 'evil emotion'. They'd just be things like being a vampire and hunting down people (or werewolf, or something like that) or some kind of giant like Godzilla, destroying the city, or leading an alien invasion. Funnily enough, I grew up Catholic. I had this ritual of saying one 'Our Father' prayer and make the sign of the cross before I was allowed to think of any of this stuff. It's like it made it okay. I don't know how or why I thought this, but making the sign of the cross was like logging on and off from God's mind. I logged on to pray, so I was thinking it directly to God. If I logged off, God could listen if he wanted, because he's a god, but I wasn't 'saying' or 'thinking' it to him directly. These daydreams were triggered by something I had seen in the media, but it's impossible to blame 'violent TV and video games' because it starts with things that don't seem so bad, found in kids shows. Or educational stuff, like animals hunting each other.

When I was getting to puberty, I did not sneak any porn or whatever under my bed. Instead, I had this book called 'mysterious ruins' and it was about ancient civilizations. One thing sparked the 'evil emotion' so hard, I read it over and over again, and it was simply a paragraph about how aztecs would do human sacrifice by cutting out beating hearts. And I also watched an Indianna Jones movie where a beating heart was ripped out. I was obsessed about ripping out hearts. I even found a story I wrote in grade 6 about it, but it looks like the teacher never corrected it. I still wonder what would have happened if she had seen it.

As I got older, it got a little worse and a bit more sexual. There was this scene in Alien Resurrection where an alien got sucked out through a tiny hole (here is the clip if you're interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQG9uZin3fA) but I'd fantasize about about it being a person, and I'm holding onto them and making out with them while its happening.

I had a boyfriend when I was 17, but was not interested in him, I did it basically to show everyone else I could have a boyfriend. Stupid. Never again, trying to impress classmates who couldn't stand me. Anyway, all we would do is make out and it was so boring. I only felt arousal a few times. When kissing him at the school ball, and someone thought it was disgusting. And when I was lying on top of him, it felt like I holding him down. I wanted to hurt him. I had these dreams where I dismembered him, and thought 'shit, better break up'. I didn't feel anything towards him, I told him so and that was that. I only started masturbating at 19, and I learned that if I did it, it made all the violent fantasies go away, if I thought about them while masturbating. I didn't watch porn, I watched certain scenes in movies and video games which got me aroused. I considered myself asexual. I told someone, and they asked what I thought about when I masturbate. I knew I couldn't say 'wrapping my legs around someone, holding them down, and ripping their head off' so I just said nothing really, just focused on the feeling.

I'm in my late 20s and just started having sexual relations. They are just casual and I have to think of this crap to have an orgasm with a partner. At least the fantasies are kind of impossible to act out, like ripping of limbs with just hands.

But one of my fantasies with a partner is to put them to sleep and hold them while listening and feeling changes in breathing and heart rate. But I just get my partner to lie there while I do this, and it works perfectly fine because he is submissive.

Up to here, it's really all well and good in fantasy land. I was in university, and eventually doing a research project. I absolutely loved rats and mice, and I did behavioural tests in rats. At the end, we perfused the rats to harvest the brain. Part of it involved grabbing the beating heart and sticking a needle in. It did not feel good at all and I was relieved. I felt horrible, and was worried the rat wasn't properly anesthetized. So, I went on to do more animal work.

But sure enough, I started to like it as I was 'forced' to do it. Restraining rats so I could give them injections, but the rats were tame enough I didn't have to really restrain most of them. It was like they trusted me. I felt like I could really empathize with the rats, and tried to make them as comfortable as possible. We killed rats by injecting sodium phenobarbital. They'd simply fall asleep and die. I began to like holding them and nuzzling against them as they fell asleep. I would hold them until they stopped breathing. I would dissect some. Must make full use of exploited animals.

This thing seems to be some kind of defense mechanism. I find something disturbing at first, and then come to like it. I will only like it if I consider it bad. For example, killing plants does nothing for me. Insects – I have eat those slowly alive. Now I do experiments with mice, and I was taught how to do cervical dislocation. So now I would put mice to sleep with gas anesthetic, and break their necks. This feels so good. Recently, I have been putting them under, and breaking necks as soon as they start waking up, so I can feel them struggle a bit. The next 'escalation' will be to do it fully awake. I don't want to do that. Cervical dislocation is a humane method of euthanasia, but I do it under anesthetic so the mouse is completely still and there is no chance of mucking it up. Awake it fine too, but there is a greater risk of not fully breaking the neck. And that indeed would be next. Breaking bones and leaving them alive for a bit.

Look, I do think there is a long way before I'd think about torturing animals, let alone killing humans. But it bothers me, is the capability there? I do have a reasoning mind, which says nobody's (no animal's – except maybe insects) pain is worth my pleasure. When I hear about lust and thrill murders, or anything like that, I think 'in what mind do you think killing somebody is worth a bit of pleasure. Doesn't anything else feel good, or what?' Because that's the thing, making animals feel good works just as well, if not better. Nothing better than having a purring cat on your lap. Or a rat grooming you. Although I do think part of it is also compulsion.

I used to avoid any sort of movie, or video clip with actual animal cruelty. Because it was actually real and I didn't want to feel any sort of pleasue from animals in pain. Even against the reasoning of 'oh, it's already done, I didn't actually cause it, so just why not? Oh its animals eating each other, totally natural, predators need to eat'. But yeah, now I'm killing animals for a job. I could do whatever to mice without anyone knowing before I kill them. This is the scary part. Once I taped a mouse's tail to its cage and poked at it and it became angry at me, which was the point. That's probably the worst I have done. I don't want to like it, but I do. It's a really strange thing that.

Is anybody else like me? Is this common? As the Dahmer interview said, this isn’t something people talk about, which is why I am making this post. I don't know who else to talk to about it. Am I in danger of escalating it further?

*TL;DR Have various violent fantasies and have started to enjoy restraining and killing small animals. I also have violent sexual fantasies and need them to orgasm. But it only feels good if I also think of how bad and wrong it is.*

They were hesitant but they ultimately agreed. It was at that moment that we got fairly acquainted.

She knew I had feelings for her, but she didn't share the same for me, saying I was more like her brother...fast forward 4 years, it's the same story with a different guy each time, she's always complaining why she can't find a nice guy to be with, and I just want to tell her ""hey!

This confession is obviously preemptive, but my thoughts are just as wicked as the actual action.  I have a coworker that I find very attractive and have been getting signals from her that she is interested in me as well.  It's really nothing serious at all - so far just mild flirting.

The thing is I'm married.  I have a kid and another on the way.  I really do care for my wife, but even before the recent pregnancy, things just haven't been right.  Our sex life sucks.  I look at way too much porn - to the extent that I probably could consider it an addiction - at least once a day when I'm out of town for work, sometimes when I'm home - even though she disapproves and it hurts her way too much for it to be ok.

We could get better, but I'm not sure I want to.  I out kicked my coverage with my wife - I get comments all the time about how people don't get how she ended up with me.  That being said, we got married pretty young and I've wondered what I've missed out with for quite a while.  Now there's someone else that is equally or more attractive, takes much better care of herself, and is just different.  I'm tempted to continue flirting just to see where it goes, but I have a family.  I know what damage I could cause by cheating to both my wife and my kids, but part of me doesn't care - which sickens the other part of me.  Still, if it became more evident that something could happen with the coworker, I'm not really sure I'm strong enough to resist.  It's refreshing to be desired.

TL;DR: I'm a scumbag that might cheat on my wife if the opportunity exists.",,False,,t5_2qq6g,False,,,True,t3_1b3e7e,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1b3e7e/flirting_with_someone_but_married/,

The village elder talks about the Story of Man: 


 &gt;And a Man sat alone, drenched deep in sadness. And all the animals drew near to him and said, ""We do not like to see you so sad. Ask us for whatever you wish and you shall have it."" The Man said, ""I want to have good sight."" The vulture replied, ""You shall have mine."" The Man said, ""I want to be strong."" The jaguar said, ""You shall be strong like me."" Then the Man said, ""I long to know the secrets of the earth."" The serpent replied, ""I will show them to you."" And so it went with all the animals. And when the Man had all the gifts that they could give, he left. Then the owl said to the other animals, ""Now the Man knows much, he'll be able to do many things. Suddenly I am afraid."" The deer said, ""The Man has all that he needs. Now his sadness will stop."" But the owl replied, ""No. I saw a hole in the Man, deep like a hunger he will never fill. It is what makes him sad and what makes him want. He will go on taking and taking, until one day the World will say, 'I am no more and I have nothing left to give.'""


My family is well off now, we struggled until we made it, and now it is a constant battle to keep the Company in contracts. 

I get to spend all day and night with my daughter, and stay home all day as well. My husband works 12-16 hours, and I feel like we are slipping apart.


I often find myself buying little things here or there or sending gifts to family as a temporary feeling of happiness. I honestly love to imagine accomplishing my gardens, my weight goals, however I end up just sitting around all day feeling depressed.


I have started back on Adderall as a way to get organized and motivated, however I still feel hopeless and depressed.


I am tired of feeling depressed, tired of feeling ugly, tired of wondering about my husband, tired on not accomplishing my goals. I realize there is a hole in me now, something that was filled with joy of my family when we lived in poverty or just above. We had time for each other, and enjoyed the simple joys of cooking BBQs together and traveling. Now, it is all work, and sleep. 


In one hand, my most treasured goal is to own my home and be able to pass on owned property to my daughter to she may not have to struggle like we did. On the other hand, I need to get well, for me, and for my family. Thank you for listening.

I was but a clueless 7th grader and I didn't know what it truly meant to be in a relationship with someone else. I met this guy in my life science class. I sat across from him at our table after the teacher had finished assigning our seats. We exchanged no words that day. Days later we started talking, a few week later, he got my cell phone number, and a month after that G and I were officially boyfriend and girlfriend. There was a brief moment, there, where I was truly happy, but sadly it would not last. 
I was bullied every day for being different from the rest. I dressed weirdly, I wasn't straight, and my boyfriend was abusive. He'd attack me every day on a person level making fun of who I was, what I liked, and the company I kept. He'd occasionally threaten me if I didn't change, so I did my best to change myself. No matter how hard I tried, though, I couldn't be the girl he wanted me to be. That was when I started to lie. At first it was just about little things, then some were a little more major, then I started lying abou everything. I lied to the point where all the stories I had made up could turn me into an entirely different person. I wasn't me anymore, and he loved me.
I felt like I should've been happy. I felt like I should feel beautiful, because he always told me that I was. I felt like I should feel loved, needed, wanted, but I didn't. I didn't feel a damn thing. 
And that's where it started.
Since then, I haven't been in a relationship where I haven't lied about myself. I came under the impression that people love and care more about victims because they want to protect them, since they can't protect themselves. I always showed people the bad part of me, the part that no one should ever speak of. Sometimes I'd even make stuff up about myself. I became helpless in their eyes. Nobody would truly know who I really was. Nobody could go and attack me for who I was. I was safe, enclosed in a protective shield of lies. Nobody ever broke through.
It's been so long. I met the perfect person for me. I love him. Maybe I could be the perfect person for him too. But I lied to him and I never should have. Now it's been so long that I don't know who I am anymore. He broke through though, he found out, and I'm scared.

I do this with everyone, every boyfriend iv ever had thinks I'm a horrible liar but in reality, I'm spitting it in their faces and waiting for them to catch on. When i talk, i use words, not sounds, but he uses sounds and not words and it can be so frustrating he just doesn't understand its as if i have to translate it for him through overly obvious emotional hinting. Sometimes its as if he has absolutely no idea what i am talking about and he goes along with it, picking out big words and using them incorrectly to the point he's completely off subject and doesn't even make sense, saying it as if it complies to what we are even talking about in any way because he used similar words (it doesn't) and he will switch positions throughout the argument yet act as if he's on his same point the entire transition.

I wasn't even thinking straight when I typed this. I was drunk and just went off. TL;DR at the bottom for the lazy. 

Well, I don't know where to start. Let's just start with a bit of background. I’m from a middle class home, and a family of 4 including myself. My dad used to work as a car sales man and my mother was a housewife. My little sister is handicapped and was born with a rare disease called Mucolipidosis type 3. Growing up my parents were strict and I would often get slapped or beat when I did not get good grades or did something wrong. In fear of getting my ass beat again I worked really hard in school and did well. Basically by 5th grade I was reading books like Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. Although, In school I had little to no friends and would basically follow all the kids around only to get made fun of. Since elementary school I was bullied by most kids and rarely had friends. The “friends” I had always either called me gay, ugly, or just made fun of me in general. I had also developed a bad habit of stealing. I would steal whatever I wanted which would mostly be Yu-Gi-Oh cards from other students or stores such as walmart. I would always feel really guilty afterwards but I was really interested in them but I was too afraid to ask my parents because they wouldn’t let me buy things which would distract me from school. Which I admit was really brattish of me. Don’t get me wrong though, my parents weren’t terrible. My mom did beat me and they were very sheltering and close-minded but they worked really hard to do good for my sister and I. There was constant arguing between my parents in the house and there were RARELY times where we acted like a family. I’ve seen my dad slap my mom and they were always going back and forth with yelling, throwing and arguing. Everytime I would see or hear this I would be extremely depressed and was worried they’d get a divorce. 

Moving on too middle school, the bullying continued, the arguments at home continued and it didn’t make much of a difference until I made a few friends 7th grade. Even then I often got made fun of for being ugly or shy. My parents were very sheltering so I didn’t get to go anywhere with my friends and I would have to lie to get to go to my best friends house. I also started lieing to my friends about the most useless shit, like how I just got playstation or how my dad sells cars to celebrities. I’d go to extremeties to prove my lies to be correct by taking pictures of fake receipts to show my friends and what not. I basically quit stealing but developed a bad and serious habit of lying. My grades also severely slipped as I started acting like the class clown in attempt to make more friends. 

High school is where all the serious problems started. I had moved to Canada from America and the crowd was much tougher. I started losing interest in school, kept on with my class clown habits and skipped class to go home so people wouldn’t see me sitting in class lonely. I was too scared to talk to people because I didn’t want to be made fun of or be bullied again. Skipping became a habit and eventually it was constant. The lying got even worse though, I was telling people crazy stories like how I’m from some rough hood so I could fit in and people wouldn’t find out I was actually a loner nerd with no friends. These 2 sisters were my neighbours and I started liking one and did everything I could to make her like me. I went as far as getting an ear piercing just to seem “cooler” to her. This piercing brought out a whole different “thug” side which was a complete act. After that when you think it couldn’t get any worse, I started telling her stories about how I know all these girls and one of them likes me in attempt to make her jealous. I even went as far as to making a fake msn account and talking to her through it to make my stories seem real. I’d use this account and talk to her and tell her “secrets” about me that only this imaginary person knew. 

It grew worse and then I started telling her lies about how I’m in a gang, sell drugs, go to crazy parties, hook up with so many girls when in reality I was always sitting at home staring at my computer screen. At home, my parents started hating me for failing school so I made up a lie that I was approached by a major record label and they wanted to sign me. So I was telling all these people a billion lies just to get them to accept me. I went on to tell this girl that I’m a year older than I actually am since she was older than me and only liked guys her age. I made MORE fake accounts and talked to her through all of them to tell her crazy stories about me and what I do.  She eventually started liking me. To seal the deal, I lied to my parents about how I needed money to pay fees for a music attorney to get enough money to take her to a fancy dinner. We started going out and I continued lying to her as she kept asking me stories about my past. I told her how my dad went to jail, his family sells drugs, I was constantly abused as a child and how my parents hate me. In the meanwhile, I also kept taking money from my parents to take her on dates by giving wild excuses about how my music career was sprouting.

Moving on to current day, I’ve been going out with this girl for over 2 ½ years now. She still thinks I’m older than her, she doesn’t know my real birthday, she doesn’t know anything. Our relationship is built on lies and same goes for my parents. I’m probably the biggest dirt bag in the world because I stole money and about $1,500 worth of gold from my mom to use on my girlfriend. I’ve also been telling my girlfriend how I just got $100,000 by signing a big record deal. I told her this because there was a time in between where I had no job, dropped out of high school and I wanted to give her a reason to be with me.  I still have fake accounts I use to talk to my girlfriend which are mainly ""friends"" who help give her relationship advice (Basically they tell her all the shit i wish i could say but i'm too scared too and too find out what she thinks of me). So i pretty much have a huge network of fake ""friends"" aside from the couple ones that actually exist.

I continually tell my parents lies to keep them happy and same with my girlfriend. I’m completely dead inside at this point, I’m constantly depressed, pissed off and just don’t know what to do with my life. I’ve built my whole life on an intricate web of lies and no one knows me. I have no one to cry to and it’s all my fault. I have no one to blame but myself and its killing me inside. I have no motivation and so many regrets. I want to tell them everything and finally be free of carrying all these secrets and hiding lies but I’m too scared to lose any of them because I never had anyone there before. I don’t use aany of the money I steal or lie to get on myself but it all goes to making these other people happy and for no reason. I admit my wrongs. 

I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life, I don’t know where I am in life. At this point, I want to quit everything. I’m selfish and I work to my own benefit. There’s so much more I wish I could say but I can’t remember everything right now and it’s really too much to list. My life’s a wreck currently. I know I have problems with me, but I’m tired now. I know I'm crazy but I don’t want to do this anymore. The only problem is I also don't want to lose my girlfriend as she’s the closest thing I’ve ever had to a best friend/lover. I can’t tell my parents because they’ll hate me. All i want to do is tell them everything, give them hugs, kisses and say how much they mean to me but in real life I know they'd leave.

The craziest part is, I know why I’m doing all this and it’s all making sense as I type this but I really can’t bring myself to stop. It;'s been going on for over 5 years now. I've went to great lengths to prove my lies to be true and it's worked so far. 

TL;DR Was smart, took my smartness and applied to lying to everyone to make them happy in fear of being lonely due to being bullied and put down by my parents since I was a kid. Girlfriend thinks i'm an older rich guy (1 year older) and parents think i'm a big shot musician. Reality? I'm a high school drop out with no future, depression and obviously either fucking crazy or some sort of evil lying genious. Basically my lies piled on, connected with each other and snowballed into a huge mess and now no one knows who the fuck I really am.

Is it my fault? yes. Do they deserve to know the truth? yes. Am i an asshole? yes. This isn't to gain sympathy, get attention or advice.

I've had ongoing depression as long as I can remember. My childhood was fine, other than the police coming to my house every once in a while because my grandmother (who I lived with) thought my mother was unfit to raise me and the neighbor boy molesting me. I was really attached to my mother, but she was a nurse and consequently, didn't spend much time with me. But when we were together, we would fight constantly. She would say terrible things like how she wished she had an abortion, put me up for adoption, and other things like that. I even remember one time I asked her to drive me back to my elementary school to retrieve a book I needed for homework. Instead of the ten minute car ride, she went on an hour long tirade about how I was going to amount to nothing, how I ruined her life and was so irresponsible. That culminated in her taking a statue of the Virgin Mary and hitting it repeatedly against a dresser screaming that I made her do this. In 7th grade, she moved out of my grandma's house to move in with her long-term boyfriend. Their relationship predates my mom and biological dad's, but they kept in touch. She moved out and I just felt so abandoned. As the years went by, I fell deeper into a depression that I attempted suicide. A few times, I just attempted to choke myself out but I would always wake up hours later.  I reached out to my mom and the school guidance counselors, but that never worked. Then finally, I just had enough and took a lot of Advil PM. My grandparents assumed I was sick when they heard me throwing up in the bathroom and called my mom. Her, being a registered nurse, knew right away what I had done. Instead, she just took me to her apartment and left me in my room until I was throwing up blood. She said she would take me to the hospital, but I had to tell her so. She also said there was no coming back from that and it would be permanently following me. She tried for hours to dissuade me from going there until finally we went to the emergency room. I was too out of it to correctly tell them what I had done so they treated me for dehydration and I was on my way home. For a time, everything seemed okay. I got into college (not the one she wanted me to go to, of course) and I thought everything was fine. Then I started to feel it crawling in the back of my head. Immediately, I tell my mom and she says to tough it out. I talk to the on campus counselor and apparently what I said alarmed them so they took me to the psych ward the next day. As soon as I told my mom that I went, she took the next train into the city and saw me. In the visiting room, she broke down and cried asking why I was doing this to her. The rest of my time there was pretty relaxing and I found it helpful during the day. But at night, she would call, complaining about her day and saying things like 'I never expected you to be there' and 'you have no idea how much money you cost me.'  I was let go and decided to take the rest of the term off and get adjusted to my medication. This happened in February. Flash forward to now, I don't think my medication is working, my situation with my mom hasn't improved and I feel like I made the wrong choice by choosing to go to community college for a year instead of trying again at my big university. Every night, I just think about ending it all because it would be so much easier. Every day feels like a nightmare and I don't know how to deal with this.

 One night I got really drunk and pissed right outside of the local bar. Literally, on the front steps and pissed onto the street. I was super blacked out. Because of that my school put me on 'probation' and asked me to submit several different documents, etc. etc. 

Well, I didn't do any of the stuff they asked me to do, and instead on Cinco de Mayo I got plastered drunk again and pissed in the exact same spot as the first time. I was busted and now I'm awaiting my second probationary hearing to see if I am still eligible to be a student next semester. 

I'm hoping it goes well. I'm going to take responsibility for my actions and see how that goes (the alternative being a ""student hearing"" where I take it to a board of students). I think if they dismiss me it will be a very unfortunate and excessive punishment, but I can't say I don't see it happening. It was not a very responsible thing for a 21 year old to do.

My partner has decided to leave me. She is moving out shortly and our 18 month old will spend 4 days with her then 3 with me per week. We have a stable break up and can talk realistically generally as we want to put our son first as far as we can. I am having to help her financially because if not she would have to move away to move in with her family or my son would effectively live in poverty when with her. I have enough money for this but know she will depend on my help but she is adamant she does not need my help but is accepting of it anyway. She refuses to acknowledge that finances will be a problem without my help but seriously, they would, and I am not prepared to have my son live so far below my standard when not in my care. People look at us as the most laid back, sorted couple or did till now. For the record for women assuming there is a major issue that men just don't understand there has never been any indiscretion between us, we are very financially viable, have a great home and schedule but somehow we have grown apart. It has nothing to do with the other two issues in my life. There is no one thing which has caused this.


Secondly my mum is battling 2 types of cancer and has been undergoing chemotherapy on and off for some months. My ex-partner is simply not interested and has never thought of this as something which will affect me as I rarely show my feelings but for god sake this must affect anyone to some degree. We are not openly affectionate as a family and I don't know if this makes it worse or better. I had a lot of difficulties with my mum when growing up including a kind of abuse but have moved past that as far as I can even though I will never forget it.


My dad is an alcoholic and effectively leaves me and my sister to run our struggling family businesses. I have my own business also and we have had to turn his companies upside-down to keep them viable and successful. They were run in such an old fashioned way but to him in his drunken haze, have made him money and he has openly said he wouldn't care if he ran them into the ground. One of the companies was caught ignoring much legislation and I had to face a government body as a representative to explain ourselves and fix the problems. I implemented systems to make us an industry leader in production systems and attempted to future proof the company where possible but have never received any financial benefit or praise for this but I couldn't stand to see it go under. Everyone I know thinks I have just dealt with a couple of issues and have basically ignored the more serious problems and do not know how close we were to losing the business. Family just don't want to know and on a smaller scale have an attitude of the company being too big to fail. There is more every day however and I hate it.


I feel numb most of the time and show little to nothing. This is not because I don't want to but it really does feel like I will lose it if I let it out. I worry that I will have a breakdown of a kind or have some other emotional issues and am scared this will affect me as a dad. I don't want my son to ever look at me the way I look at members of my family.

Majoring in Finance with a creative writing minor.  I love business and I want to start my own one day, but the classes bore me to tears.  On the other hand, I can't get enough of my writing classes and I regularly stay after class and talk to the professors.  I have a 2.2 GPA at a above average university, and I had a 3.8 in high school which was four years ago.

I work thirty hours a week to support myself, usually taking home between 700-850 a month.  Rent and bills are about 450-500 every month which makes living extremely difficult sometimes.  I have 12k in student debt and 75 hours to show for it, plus another 2k in credit card debt that help cripple me financially.  Thirty hours a week for work plus fifteen at school make me incredibly tired and extremely irritable.  The last two years might have been the worst of my life.  The more I think about full-time college students with no cares in the world besides drinking, fucking and school the more angry and jealous I get.  

I want to take a semester to a year off of school and focus on writing, business ventures and paying off my debt.  I also want to find my drive for academic success that others have.  I want and need to succeed in school so badly, but I would much rather write a spec-script for an episode of Seinfeld.  

My parents, who last year gave me a whopping $500 total, love me dearly and I love them back.  However at the age of 23 I still feel this odd feeling to impress them and do as they please.

5th grade it finally happened! The one I love dates me... For a week she used me so she wouldn't look dumb at a get together being the only one without a date by then every one knew I liked her

6th grade I accepted the fact that I loved her and the dreams got worse she was In all of them no one dated me because they knew I loved her they knew before I did. I started a list of plans I was overly nice, mean, didn't care about her, I tried every thing.

7th grade I bought her presents for her birthday Christmas valentines day. Even when she had a boyfriend I didn't care I they bested me up and left me a few scares no one could live her like I could. she never wore my presents of jewels she started to hate me in fact.

I had this idea for a short story that I was writing, and it was interesting and somewhat original. I felt I had found my calling in life.

It fit the story so well but just as fast as I had gained that momentum of writing, I lost it. All of it.

I've reached the highest level of promotions I can without becoming a supervisor. I've worked hard to get to where I am.

I have only one more obstacle to accomplish before earning my next promotion to supervisor and receiving a raise, company vehicle(maybe), company cell phone, etc. The thing is, even though it's not the hardest thing I've had to do, I feel as though I am unable. I am almost frightened by it. 

Music has been a passion of mine ever since I can remember. Any occasion you can think of, I've made a playlist for it. 
I'm a musician, well rounded in drums, bass, guitar, lyrics. Side note, this is another example of not finishing something, I'm very good at all of these but haven't mastered. 
I've recently decided to build my own recording studio. I've spent a lot of money in gear, remodeled my house for the studio's specs, promoted and made a detailed business plan. After a couple of months of juggling my day job and also building my studio, the studio is finally complete, mostly. All that's left is detailed cleaning and setting up my equipment where I want. I'm so financially, mentally, emotionally and physically invested in this project, it's most likely unhealthy. I've never wanted anything more than to be able to make a career out of my passion. But, I can't seem to get the motivation to complete even the smallest task pertaining to it. The passion isn't lost, just the motivation. I'd hate to see this all fall because I'm mentally fucked up.

Am I doomed for a life of mediocrity? What is this mental barrier I can't seem to overcome? Why do I only tease myself with the concept of success when I can't seem to reach it? I've reached the finish line, but instead of crossing, I stare at it until it passes me by. It's causing a sense of worthlessness and depression in every waking thought. Any suggestions? Any personal stories about overcoming these issues? Please, I'm running out of options.

A couple of us from out group talk about how stupid he's being, and how he really needs to get his life together if he wants a good life. His definition of a good life is getting high and getting paid by the government.

Good job as Human Resources Director but Broke as fuck and have creditors after me 3K+ in debt.   Refuse to bring men around my almost 3 year old so I only have a few hours a night one time a week to go out and ""date"" which I'd rather spend with my friends, because lets face it, I hate every man I date and cant stand dating and see absolutely no point in ever bringing a man around my child or getting married because until she is an adult, she is my main focus, not men. She has a dad whos actually not a piece of shit now that we arent together and Im not supporting him.  I haven't fucked in 6 months.  Fucking is my favorite thing in the world.  I'm getting depressed due to lack of fuck.  Vibrators don't work for me. I fail at one night stands with every miserable attempt, I am too socially awkward.  I refuse to go back to any previous partners. I need the money. I need the dick.  I love older men. I love helping people.  Im a fucking freak in bed and really have only ever found one person who I enjoyed sleeping with...in the middle of the night on a booty call.  I have gone from thinking about it to seriously considering setting myself up as a call girl either independently or through an escort service at the end of the summer when my whole ""get fit"" thing is done (20 lbs down, 10 to go!). There are things in life my, albeit good job, will never pay for.  Moving my daughter and I out of my moms seems hopeless, I have these tattoos started from when I was apprenticing at a tattoo shop that need finished.  Starting them was free, sure, but pregnancy came, money went out the window along with my dream of being a tattooist and now I need to get about 700 to finish up everything we started years ago, I dont even want to be swimming around my family because I am embarrassed of my half done tattoos. 

Bpnus confession: Everyday I look at my life and want to die. Im serious. If I had a gun Id just finish it. Im pathetic. Everything about me is and unless I get some serious money going, Im never going to amount to shit.  This moring I dropped my kid off at day care, went to the look out point in town, drank my coffee and killed 30 minutes before work contemplating if I should just drive off the cliff.  This is a once a week trip for me.

Sell myself or kill myself.  At least if I sold myself Ill be getting laid.

Second bonus: I love my child I do. But being a mom is not the route Id have taken if I had realised what turmoil my life would become. I would go back an abort if there was a time machine.  I love my girl, I hate my life.


TLDR I want to become a call girl so I can regularly get fucked with out dating anyone, so I can finish my half done tattoos, and so I can move my child and I out of my moms house.

As a guy who has been single for a while now, I notice women *very* quickly. My manager was definitely the first one to catch my eye. Being that she is an older woman (two years older than me) and the store's assistant manager, I can't help but feel attracted to her sense of seniority and power over me. So, I started casually hanging out with her before/after work, and we talk a lot. It was not long before we packed up our stuff after a closing shift for a very spontaneous road trip to go get drunk together with a friend of hers a state over. Hell, we even hit the town on various nights and we would get trashed. Anyways, came to find out in the midst of it all that she is engaged. Usually this is a turn off for me, but this time, for some reason, it just made me want her more; now I have an impossible challenge.

She talks about her fiancée a lot and I know he travels for business most of the time, and whenever he is home she is normally scheduled to close (with me). From what she tells me, he does not appreciate her gifts, surprises, or when she tries to be sexy for him, he is very insecure, and he is extremely paranoid that she will cheat on him (note that he does not know that I do tons of things with her that he cannot due to his job, let alone that I even exist). So, during random talks, I have been getting a little *jokingly* flirtatious with her, and she doesn't mind.

A few weeks ago, I told her that at first, I had a bit of a crush on her, but I dropped it when I found out she was engaged (only half true). She wasn't creeped out and thanked me for telling her. Since then, she has been talking to me even more and even called me before her fiancée about a pregnancy scare she had just a few weeks ago. Just yesterday, She called me to see if I wanted to hang out. Little did I know, yesterday ""hanging out"" meant me showing up at her house alone to talk with her while she tanned in what her fiancée apparently says is the skimpiest bikini she owns. He doesn't like her wearing it in public because he doesn't like other men gawking at his gorgeous fiancée. She is even mad that he won't drape her around his arm and walk with her like the trophy wife she is (going to be at least).

At this point, I have been slowly working on sabotaging her relationship because I feel I could do better than her fiancée, that she would be happier with me, and that I would better appreciate her. I feel like I deserve her more than the man she plans on marrying. I would do anything/everything to/for her.

I just had to get that off my chest. No one else knows and I got tired of keeping that in.

**TL;DR** I want to be a home wrecker because I am a selfish, egotistical, knight in shining armor.

Edit: I'm pretty sure she knows I still like her (I told her I don't) because she has been trying to hook me up with a friend of hers that she says ""likes the same stuff as her, acts similarly to her, and is built a lot like her but with less ass and rack (implying she knows I like her curves... and I do).""",,False,,t5_2qq6g,1369645056.0,,,True,t3_1f4miq,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1f4miq/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_her/,

It has to do with just about every facet of my life, how I was raised, etc. So this post may be lengthy. If you don't want to read it, I understand, but this is more of a form of catharsis for me, so that I can let it out and potentially make sense of it.

To begin with, my mother has been highly controlling of me and my every action my entire life. She wants me to go on and do great things, because she has been held back her entire life because of her own mistakes. She does not want me to make the same mistakes, namely getting married and having children at a young age. As such, she often despised my boyfriends and claimed they were a bad influence. In reality, they were really trying to help me become independent from her, and I think she knew that. 

However, the reason she is so damned and determined for me to finish my education and go on to law school is because of my siblings. In my mothers eyes, they all made bad mistakes that made their lives hard. My brother got married and joined the military, and my sisters both married and had children and did not complete their education. They express regret for this, but they all claimed they did so to get away from my mother who is, again, extremely controlling. Truthfully, I don't much blame them, and I recently moved in with my boyfriend to get out from under so that I could live more independently (to her rage and consternation). 

BUT what I'm really trying to say is this. I've been pressured my entire life to make up for the mistakes of my siblings and be, I feel, perfect. Any time I make a decision she doesn't agree with, she verbally tears me apart for it. That, and I'm terrified of disappointing her. She's faced so much disappointment and heartache in her life, and I want to be the one to make her proud. 

I'm in school currently studying for a double major in Criminal Justice and Political Science, with plans to go to law school. But I'm afraid I'm not ready, and I would truthfully like to take a year off after I graduate to recharge and save money so that I can at least not have so much debt when I do go to law school. But my mother really wants to me go right after I graduate, and I know she wont be happy if I postpone my education.

Truthfully, that year off working would also be spent living with my boyfriend in another city, but I think my mother would have a heart attack if I actually went through with it. I'm terrified she'll never speak to me again, and despite her faults, she's still my mother and I do love her. But I also want to live my own life on my own terms but I don't know what the right decision is.

And finally, I'm not even sure I will like law school. I feel so uncertain about it, but she keeps this subtle pressure going in the back of my head, and I'm not even sure she realizes how much it stresses me out. I really just want to do something that makes me happy, but I don't know...I don't think me being happy will be good enough for her, because half the time, anything I do is never good enough.

When things are good between us, they're great, so I put up with feeling worthless for those rare opportunities to feel on top of the world. He knows me inside and out, which is a double-edged sword. It means he knows what to do to make me happy, but he knows exactly what to do to make my self-worth plummeting. We've broken up a few times because it reaches a boiling point and I can't stand being so disrespected and hurt, but then I worry that I've lost the love of my life. 

 I feel so stupid. When I have lucid moments, I realize that I deserve better. But then my insecurity floods in and I try to hold onto it, because even though it is awful 80% of the time, the other 20% makes me feel happy.

 This is the third emotionally abusive relationship I've been in since I've started dating. I know that I go for asshole guys, because the really nice guys seem _too_ nice, and it seems suspicious to me.

I don't know how he found this out but he told me, anyways to continue he was trying to convince me to try it. I would repeat it's weird and what not but eventually tried it.

I found it to be somewhat enjoyable but after a little bit i felt it was wrong, and decided not to do it. We stopped hanging out as much and now I'm 12years old.

he comes over and i tell him I started masturbating again, saying it as a secret, as well as someone I can talk to since the past. He says ""I'll play with you, it will feel good"" i do the same thing as last time and  eventually fall into peer pressure.

For background: I'm British and I grew up as a chav (lower class scum, usually a bully) and was bullied myself. I stopped being a chav and became nerdy half way through high school. Despite this change I never really fit in with the academic/ nerdy or middle class students. In fact I hated them and their entire way of life. Perhaps jealousy, but partly that it is nonsensicle at times.

I'm capable of being completely middle class outwardsly, in fact I am a high achiever at one of the UK's best universities for one of its nerdiest degrees  and I'm on the masters now, and despite all of this behaviour I still resonate with my background as a below-the-poverty line chav.

I hate these nerds. I hate these unsociable pathetic weak losers. I hate them enough that I want to hurt them. Being civilised I no longer can hurt them physically, but I plan to hurt them where they care the most; their sense of superiority. 

You see, anyone at a top university for a top subject doing a masters will clearly see themselves as superior to others, and to them a chav, or someone like them, could *never* be one of them. Well, my little confession is that I plan to gloat and bully these people once I've graduated. Not just the ones at my university, but all of them.

I used to do this, obviously as a chav, when I was younger, but their response was always ""You're never going to do well, I can't wait until you're bagging my shopping"". So now, here I am one year from graduating with a 1st at a top university.

I will show them for looking down on me. I will shout at them as a chav would, I will get my old lower class accent and show them that I am not worthless. I will do it while getting a higher paid job than them, with a better looking wife than them, with more friends, a social life and generally doing better.

I will gloat, I will be mean, I will bully those shits for ever looking down on me due to my birth status.

Perhaps you, the reader, may see this as stupid, pointless and inconsequential to my life; but it is one of the reasons I am doing so well. And I cannot wait to use it to hurt them.

After re-checking the bill before I paid it, I noticed that one of them was a bit high compared to last year's usage so I submitted a meter reading and it brought the bill down by about $60. It was then I realised that I could just pay this new bill, not tell my housemates and keep the surplus for myself, being strapped for cash at the time.

After paying this new bill, one of my housemates asked for a copy of the email the utilities company sent so he and his parents knew how much he paid. I quickly opened my emails, saved the page and edited the html to change the price I actually paid to the price he gave me money for.
A day later, a revised bill came through the door while my housemates were out explaining the new price. I quickly opened it up (it was addressed to me), took one look at it, stuffed it in my paper shredder and turned on the paperless billing option on my account.

1296148628.0,6,self.confessions,fa4tm,I was in a MMF threesome.,,17,11,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/fa4tm/i_was_in_a_mmf_threesome/,"Background: An old college buddy of mine married a smokin hot girl from Latvia or Lithuania or wherever.  At his wedding there were 3 ""best men"" and I may have been a bit drunk for our toast and said something like, ""Dude, she's way too hot for you,"" and (looking at her), ""When this thing goes sour you have my number, right?""  Anyway I'd never met the girl prior to their wedding so it was probably highly inappropriate for me to say that at the time... whatever.

Story: About 5 years after they got married I was traveling for work, and had to make a stop in their town.  I'm visiting them in their home, we're all having drinks... one thing leads to another, and she says, ""Of all of [HIS] friends, you're the one I've wanted to fuck the most.""  She's still smoking hot, maybe 24 at the time.  We're both about 30.

So I look over to gauge my buddy's reaction to this -- I'm expecting some sort of anger or annoyance -- instead he just he looks back and says, ""Let's make it happen.""  I've known him since we were 18 year-old freshmen, he's never mentioned anything about swinging to me before...  I've never so much as seen him in the locker room.

Anyway we went at it.  He took an end, I took an end, we'd swap... it was basically just like getting head while watching a porno at the same time.  Certainly she wasn't as focused as she could have been in a one-on-one situation... but it wasn't too weird.  My buddy had kind of a small dong... and for real, once you've seen that another man's junk is significantly smaller than yours it's hard to respect him.

At one point she said, ""Hold me down, pretend like you're forcing me...""  Man, it was odd and fun and just odd.  My buddy was holding her arms, and fucking her mouth intermittently, slapping her tits... mostly he was just focused on chanting, ""Fuck that slut, fuck her!  Fuck her whore pussy!"" while I was balls deep in her.  He got all animalistic with his voice, was kinda creepy.

When I was ready he said, ""Cum in her mouth, make her swallow it!""  He held her face to my dick and I busted in her mouth.  He yelled, ""Swallow it whore!""  Then we switched sides, had he on her back on an ottoman, and he told me, to ""throat fuck her,"" while he fucked her in the ass.  ""Slap her tits, harder... she really likes it.""  When he was ready he busted on her stomach.

No swords ever crossed and I went back to my hotel room after, we never really spoke of it again.  About a year and a half later they had a kid, she got fat, and he took a job (at my company) where he would be required to travel a lot more.  The only time he mentions her is to say how pissed off he is that she got so fat, or to complain that she's going to make their daughter grow up fat, and to warn people to say off the Eastern European women, ""They just don't age well.""

PS: Anyone else feel they should rename ""Confessions"" to ""Bragging Confessions"" -- admittedly this is half bragging, but it really does feel good to tell someone about it.

It was not something that I would have done, but situations and actions that she did kind of forced me into it. 

She was employed at the place I work in last December, when we were still a couple, and now both of us work at the same place, however we are not together.

It is still very awkward. It's also a real bummer because a lot of friends that I was close to before I introduced her don't really talk to me anymore. I miss those friends a lot; I know it will never be the same with them again.

I also feel like I am being judged due to stories that my ex may have told about petty complaints she may have had when we were together, as I've heard rumors that I've treated her badly when we were together. But that is not the case, because I've done things for her that brought us ridiculously close when we were together (personal problems).

I do not like making a scene, so whenever I had a problem with her I would not talk about it in public, while she was the opposite. When she had a problem with me, she would make it known that she was not happy. Her issues with me were not usually a big deal, they were normally small things, like going to a workout class she taught, just work schedules got in the way.

Also, it's real tough because I am finding myself have to rebuild my life, because it seems like she took control of my old one. I don't know what to do. I'm not a bad guy, I just don't toot my own horn when I do something right, or make my actions that I do for other people this big public ordeal.

It just sucks because I was in a real bad situation and had to make a change to my life, but it's tough now months after the break up. 

I got out of a situation I could not win in, to get in another situation where I have to face just as many difficult instances.

My best friend (I'll call him Sam) and I have had a very long, toxic relationship. To start with, we are exes. We dated while I was in HS and he was in college, and I was really immature and superficial and broke up with him multiple times for stupid reasons, including that his sense of humor annoyed me and I hated the way he dressed. But I had self esteem problems and dealt with being rejected by a lot of other guys I liked, so I kept going back out with him when he initiated stuff. 

We were each others' ""first"" everything. But when I got to college, I left him for/cheated on him with a scumbag guy (I'll call him Tony) who convinced me that Sam had cheated on me first and I deserved better. Yes, I know, I'm a horrible person for the way I treated Sam, and I regret it all the time. But after not speaking to each other for several years, out of the blue he sent me a message saying he missed how close we were in high school, before we dated, and he wanted to be friends again. I agreed in part because I was still dating Tony, and regretted it all. Tony was abusive, and I believed I deserved it because of leaving my best friend for him. I used Sam as an emotional crutch, to support me until I was ready to leave Tony, and Sam did the same with me, to get away from his gf who was cheating on him. We became really close again and have been friends for about 5 years since the make-up. We have dated other people, dealt with the awkwardness of being friends and exes at the same time - we've been friends with benefits when we both were single, and there have been issues of jealousy that have come up on both sides.

At this point though, I feel like I wish we had never become friends again. We are bad for each other in a lot of ways, just like we were when we dated. He patronizes me all the time, acting like he's smarter and more mature than me because he's older and has done it all, seen it all, and accuses me of having anger problems. I have a temper, yes, and I don't control it with him like I should because I let my guard down too much, because we are so close. But when I feel like I have a legitimate reason to be mad at him, for patronizing me or acting controlling, or other subtle abuse, he gaslights me and acts like I'm crazy, I'm overreacting, he's not doing anything wrong. While I sometimes feel dependent on him, because he is my closest friend, he has openly said several times that he has other ""best"" friends, that I'm just a normal friend or even ""lower"" on his scale because I'm an ex.

I want to ""break up with him"" as a friend for good, but we have at this point a very intertwined social circle. I'd never be able to avoid him completely. And I'm afraid of confrontation. Also, part of me actually wonders if maybe he is right, maybe I'm paranoid about the gaslighting because of the abuse I dealt with from Tony, and I'm the one really at wrong here, just like back in college. I don't make friends well, I'm very introverted and afraid that if I alienate him and our mutual friends side with him, I'll be virtually alone.

He's in his late 20s and I am in my early 20s. I noticed him a few days before meeting him because of his hair-I had no particular opinion, I just noticed him. When I finally met him, we hit it off right away. He was very friendly to me and he made me laugh-he is the first person I felt at ease with this year. I began talking to him more and developing a crush on him. He always made me smile! We had a moment when I thought we might kiss at a formal event because we were both drunk but I ended up excusing myself to leave with friends because I thought I would either make a fool of myself or (if he really did want to kiss me) put him at risk of losing his job. We never spoke of that night again really but I always felt sexual tension (Whether or not it was mutual I cannot say for sure). The day I left school I had some alone time with him. I could have told him my feelings or at least that I thought he was attractive, but I just couldn't for some reason. I was scared and I didn't want him to think of me as a silly schoolgirl having a crush on him because he's an older man. I don't just think of him that way, I think of him as someone I feel equal to, especially because he never made me feel otherwise. I guess I was pretty obvious with my attraction, though. He even joked about me wanting to be with him, and I don't know if he realized how accurate the ""joke"" was! If he weren't my supervisor I would have been much more open, regardless of the age difference, but otherwise it would undermine his position. He's a talented singer and I found a youtube video of him singing after someone told me about his band. I still listen to it and his singing still echoes in my mind. I will never forget him, even though I will probably never see him again because he lives ""across the pond"". I secretly hold on to the hope that I will bump into him again some day, but I don't tell anyone because they will probably think I am pathetic.

I was supposed to graduate college this May. Because of my health problems I had to push a lot of work of and ended up needing extensions (again). Because I needed to finish work in 3 classes my school did not allow me to participate in commencement. This crushed me, which only exasperated my problems. I was given until the end of June to complete my work. 

However, I fell into a deeper depression than what I was in. I pushed of my work and felt it was impossible. I pushed everyone away and when asked I said I was fine. About a week before the end of June I only had part of the work done for one class. I had a breakdown, my mom ended up carling the dean of the school and my doctor faxed a note about my ongoing depression.


During this time I had also changed medications twice. 


Anyway, I got my deadlines pushed back until the end of July for two of my classes. I had enough work for one that I could pass with a D-. (In HS I never got lower than a B. College was usally A/B as well). I got the work done for my 2nd class (B). Now my final class... I have done so little for. So, so little. I need to write: 6pg, two 3-5pg, and a 15-20pg paper. I told everyone earlier in the month that a had a schedule (not a lie) and that I was following it (major lie).


I have no idea what to do. I take meds for ADHD/concentration to help with anxiety. It helps but it makes me not eat or sleep much. 

I keep telling people when they ask that I'll get it done, but I'm terrified that I won't. I'm so desperate that I would go so far as you pay someone to do this for me. 


Then there is a part of me that wants to fail, that is scared to succeed. I've had a lot of pressure from my family to do well, to not be like my older brother (failed out of community college because he didn't do his work, just went back a year ago and is in the same patten as before). I've been told all my life how intelligent I am and my potential. I went to the equivalent of an ivy league, but all women. I'm tired and I'm scared and I just want it to be over but I can't seem to get,myself to do anything.


After being omitted from commencement and then told that because I did not complete my work by the end of June I was being reclassified as a 2014.... I'm just so angry and upset. 


I can't tell my mom the truth (at home now) because she is all freaked out about it too. But I'm tired of lying and feeling stressed all the time and being up at 4am on my phone posting here. I just .. Don't care and care so much at the same time.

She is non-related, but she sees me as a brother.

She is very hot and I’ve always had a thing for her, but never admitted it. So I soon found pictures of her online (Facebook etc.) to get myself off. So one day when I was around 14, I decided to sneak in to her room, and take some of her clothes (undies, bras, dresses, etc.) and put them on and sniff them, while getting myself off. This became a regular, doing it every second or so day, since she was at work most of the time. I nearly got caught on several occasions, with things like leaving a towel of mine in the room, or the room being changed, but somehow there was another explanation for everything. It got to the point where I couldn’t stop, and I loved it, stuffing the bra, or wearing some of her undies for a whole day. I have never told anybody and it still continues today, although far less regularly.

I probably need help.

That right there is already bad innit? I'm definitely not bad looking and i've been told before lots of times that I look cute or sexy or hot or whatever the case. But it's really hard for me to talk to random girls because I get extremely nervous and just end up making things awkward. And no matter how much I like a girl, I can't get the courage at all to make the first move. My old school was filled up with like 90% boys. So I rarely got to see girls in my class.




I seriously want to be in a relationship. But i'm afraid because the times when I do ask if someone wants to go out, they would reject me cause they either have a boyfriend or I make it really awkward asking them out and fuck up the whole thing.




I hate dating sites. It's miserable. Then when I get girls who want to talk to me on there, they only send short replies like ""Hey, sup, cutie, lol, cool, etc"" Can't even keep a proper conversation going with them without only getting short replies like that back. Then they're always located too far away. So it's like, fuck. Right?





Can't travel anywhere far either because all I have is a license, but no car. Just one shitty ass sports motorcycle that decides to work whenever it damn well pleases and even then it's of no use because i'm too scared to talk to girls and i'm not all familiar with NJ oh and also i'm broke as hell.




Does this all seem like really fucking pathetic pussy ass shit? Yea, I admit. But it's not like i'm purposely living like this. I really do want to change, but it's like there's a window there. I could see where I want to be. But it's just that it won't let me go through to the other side where I want to be. 




It's an obstacle that i'm seriously trying to overcome, but it's extremely difficult for me. If I could choose to not have this anti-social issue, I would happily jump at the chance in a nanosecond. Even this confession, means nothing. The only thing that comforts me is physical affection. 




Hell just a girl hugging me makes my whole day feel better. But what am I supposed to do? Right so I just go ahead and try desperately asking girls for hug very creepily? Even get together meetings for me are extremely hard for me to open up.




Can't make this shit sound more manly. Call me a pussy for all I care. Re-reading all this stuff, I wouldn't even blame you. This is my problem, and I just don't feel like sugar coating it anymore to try to make myself not look so damn pathetic. Don't even know what exactly to do. So in the most absolute bluntest way possible, you can call this a serious plea for help.

Let me start off by saying my biological father abandoned my mother and I, and that I never had a father figure. 


* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    I have a girlfriend and I love her dearly; however, gay  porn turns me on just as much as straight porn. 
1.   I have had oral sex with a male and was equally as turned on  as when I have sex with women... We used to have sex a lot now I have troubles getting an erection when its time to do the dirty, but I still love her and know we are good for each other at the emotional support level.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    I once almost had sex with my sister    ~~~~~~~ 
2.    This is my deepest darkest secret, and I'm glad this is anonymous. When I was 14 or 15 I used to want a girlfriend so badly and I really wanted to experience sex. I started crushing on my sister who was 10 at the time and one time we both got naked in front of each other. I have buried that and everyday I hate myself for that one moment. If I could go back in time I would tell myself to stay the fuck away from my sister... but I hate myself for it. 

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~    I feel that everyone is always out to get me    ~~~~ 
3.    Every once in a while I feel like the people around me hate me and they want to destroy what little I have. 

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~    Im a scrawny runt    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
4.    I just dont gain weight, and my voice is abnormally higher pitched than other peoples. I feel like a freak of nature, and if evolution stilled played a role nowadays I wouldn't deserve to live because I realize that I am far from perfect.

* ~~~~~~~~~~~    I'm terrified I'm a redneck    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
5.    When I was born I had a southern underbite, I also was told I had ADHD in school. Im affraid that my biological father had a redneck gene that passed on to me..

I failed.  Miserably.  Never even came close to being accepted, despite a great deal of effort, networking, etc.  I felt deeply depressed about this for years, it affected my grades and kept me from dating, and I even had thoughts of suicide.

I saw a lot of my classmates who didn't get into the societies be negatively affected by it.  They started seeing themselves as subtly inferior.  This manifested itself in their choice of career path, in my opinion.  Some declined to pursue a career in finance (the most prestigious option at the time) and instead settled for law or consulting (still prestigious, but marginally lower-paid and less secure), as well as just generally thinking of themselves as less than first-rate.  I was determined not to let myself be hurt in that way, and perhaps for that reason, I cannot seem to let go of my outrage at being rejected (over 10 years ago at this point).  Just yesterday, I had an episode of internalized rage.

This has also hurt my relationship with my family.  My father, who graduated from that same university, explicitly tried in his adult life to join lower socioeconomic groups as some sort of reaction against his experiences there.  This meant, among other things, that he sent me to an inferior public school system, even though he could have afforded the finest prep school, his fear being that I would self-identify as a member of the elite, and not one of the masses, if I went to a private school.  I was at least able to convince him to send my little brother to a private boarding school.  Now, my brother is about to graduate and, with his preppy pedigree, be invited with open arms into the most prestigious fraternities at the university that he is attending.  I am so happy for him, and yet it is also painful to see that my own anguish was so preventable.

I realize many of you will think I am an elitist caricature, and maybe I am, but I am experienced enough to know the type of lifestyle that I want to live.  Among other things, I wish I could meet a fellow alum without being afraid of being asked whether I was in one of the societies.  So often I have had the feeling of seeing a life that I want to live, and being kept away by some sort of invisible force field.

I am a guy, 25 years old, like the title says, never had sex. 

I've always kept myself open minded, always gone towards wherever my heart felt right. I have gotten emotionally attached twice in my life so far. Both times, it has been with somebody who has been spoken far. first, it was with a married woman, close in age. took me 2 years to not have anxiety pangs when thinking about her. I'm still good friends with her. She doesn't know.

Second, more recently I have got attached to an ex-co worker, a guy, ~35 years old, married with 2 kids. I am a family friend, have been over to their place for dinners and lunches. He doesn't have a clue. I consider him the best of my friends  and cannot lie to him if he asks a question. Sometimes, I'm afraid he might ask me a question and I wont be able to lie to him about things like this topic. I get anxiety attacks when I don't speak to him for days. I even used to go to his place in the night just for some relief ( i dont know how it helped, but it did). It's gotten slightly easier now. Im able to control my emotions. I still cant listen to any song which reminds me of him without having anxiety attacks. but hopefully, It'll get easier soon.

I don't think ill ever be able to tell him anything. I value my friendship with him (and her) too much. But this hurts. whatever it is, this hurts. I don't know how to deal with this.

I don't set out to lie about the use.  When I have the opportunity to use opioids (ie: get a prescription) I can't not accept them.  I want to be honest about the use but I know she already has trust issues with me in that area (for good reason).   I feel like if I do come clean about the use she might understand or she might not.  She probably wont leave me but it would put a tremendous strain on the relationship.  

It is kind of a Catch 22 for me.  Either I tell her and feel a massive weight off my chest and she loses a lot of trust with me or maybe she would understand and just be happy I was honest.  Or I just continue to live as is and stop the drug use, which I can try to do.  Of course then there is the risk of her finding out on her own which would be really bad.

My instincts tell me to not say anything, but it would be horrible for her to find out any other way, like finding out through insurance or something.

I don't know what to do.  I feel shitty and guilty but at the same time I don't want to rock the boat and risk her completely losing trust with me, although again, it would be warranted. 

I really can't ask my friends about this either, I'm kind of alone on this one so I hope someone here could offer some advice or say something to make me feel less miserable about this.

For back story, I was raised by an abusive grandmother until I was thirteen, then lived with my parents until I graduated. I enlisted in the Army right out of high school, and when I got out, I lived with friends and my parents for a short while. 

I moved to DC for a few months, then an army buddy convinced me to leave for Phoenix. We roomed together for a little over a year, then I met my soon-to-be-wife. We moved in together after a year of dating, and after another two years of living together, got married. After a year of marriage, I left her, but I moved in with my boss, and then back with my army buddy for about a year, before I moved back out to DC. 

I am going back to Phoenix in about a month to stay with an old friend, but after a month or two, I am going to live alone for the first time in my life, and it scares the shit out of me. 

Whenever I am alone in a house at night, I can't sleep without lights and music, and I sometimes can't sleep in my own bed. I never have been able to get over this. I'm not a scrawny person. I'm the kind of size that acts like it's own deterrent. I shouldn't be afraid to be alone, yet I am.

I honestly believe that, after the failure of the more influential world governments to make meaningful progress on climate change, we have passed the tipping point, and that humanity will not be on Earth past 2150--perhaps not even 2100. The end might come from climate change somehow, like hyperstorms, or maybe just baking/drowning us all. It might come more gradually, as resource after resource runs out. But one thing is for certain: unless we make an attempt to colonize the Moon and Mars (or perhaps fling seed ships off into interstellar space in a last ditch bet-hedging), by the time the year 2200 comes around, humanity's presence will be limited to a few scattered tribal bands on its birth world, if it's still there at all, and Earth will be a lifeless wreck.

I don't go out much because I suffer from extreme anxiety attacks, more specifically agoraphobia, and I have severe digestion issues that cause me to suffer almost every day when I eat.  THAT being said as a back story over the last couple of weeks I think, i've been hearing voices in my head.  They sound like someone murmuring about me and I don't know if they are real or not.  I grow pot (legally with med license for my issues I quit 5 years of hard perscribed drugs and i'm trying to use something safer for my health), and that makes me paranoid that they are going to watch me, as I don't live in California and not a lot of people have licenses. 

Sometimes I think I hear them and I wonder if they are real.  They say sometimes cruel and mean things about me and I don't know how much of it is real and how much of it is all in my head.  I have always had a small problem with hearing voices talking about me (saying mean things about me all the time).

We were getting ready to leave when we decided to make a pit stop at the restrooms. I went and used the restroom standardly. While walking out of the stall (the bathroom had stalls on both sides) I noticed there was a purse sitting on the floor in one of the stalls on the row across from me. Nothing special about the purse you say? It is a Coach purse that sells for $298.00 dollars. At first I was going to just leave it. I was thinking that maybe it was some sort of hidden camera scam. I walked away.Then I thought, ""Wait, that is illegal, you can't have cameras in a public restroom."" I grab the bag. I was the only one in the restroom, there was a lady that past me on the way out and that was all. The purse was just sitting on the floor. Standing up, not looking like it had fallen out of a bag or anything. It still had the price tag on it and everything. After walking out my fiancée asked what is that, I just said keep walking. We walked out to our car and I pretty much started freaking out. We went over all the possibilities. Was it stolen and placed in the bathroom to be picked up later? How did it get taken out of the store? There was no security tag on it or anything. Just a price tag. Does it make me a bad person for taking it? I have justified it being ok because I didn't steal it, I just found it.

Edit: I know stealing is stealing, no matter what the item is. And if you have to justify something usually you are doing so to make yourself feel better about doing something wrong or you are not proud of.

I tried the normal psychological tricks to snap out of it and to be honest my head has been in a fog. To all those who read passively for entertainment, I hope you gain something out of this. To all those who comment, thank you for your feedback anything you say is appreciated. At the end of the day, though, this is about me and my peace of mind. I didn't want to go see a Catholic Priest so, well, here we are at r/confessions.

It started when I was browsing the internet and my thoughts started tugging me towards looking at porn. It starts and even if you don't plan on anything happening you'll convince yourself and you go through your tribal routine, but today was a little different. I guess this is my first confession, a little softie, but I have a fetish for facials. Namely, giving them out. So after browsing the normal spots and realizing nothing new was there, I decided to google for tumblrs of amateurs enjoying my fantasy out.

I found what seems to me to be a fairly legitimate website, sure it had a couple of those stupid ads on the side but overall it looked decent, or at least as decent as porn gets. Then I came upon a picture (no pun intended) that I thought was really hot, so I clicked on it to see where it would lead me. That was stupid in the first place, but it took me to a website that looked like a redtube with plenty of video links splayed out. I saw one that looked good with a hot brunette and I clicked it, and my day was instantly ruined.

I saw about .2 seconds of the page after it loaded, and even now I have somewhat of a mental block. The page it led me to was called something like ""Daddy Tube"" and it was basically hardcore CP. I instantly clicked out of all the windows and tabs I had open and got physically sick to my stomach. I dry heaved for about a minute before I finally vomited. 

After taking a minute to breathe I put things in a little context. I'm honestly so naive with computers I was worried about the feds getting my ISP at first. Then I took a minute to think and realized I didn't really intend to go there, I don't have any pictures on my computer of any illicit nature, and I don't think I'm on any top ten most wanted lists. Despite that, I've never been to such a dark place before but I tried to put it behind me. 

This little incident brought up a flood of dark guilt from my past, I even started to compulsively clean and watch my hands which is my normal compensation for that kind of thing. Then I realized that I needed to wash some things out for good, so I came here to post. Here is my story and I hope and I can reconcile some of these evils. 

The reason I think this incident sparked such a visceral response for me is simple. When I was younger I had homosexual encounters with a neighbor. It's not really as simple as that, we were maybe in first grade, and we thought we were ""playing."" It all started out so innocent, y'know how kids are curious and don't really have a concept of sexuality. We were the same age, around the time you can first get an erection, and we would literally swordfight and it just progressed to having anal sex and other things and it was all so natural at the time. We thought we were playing, but it would haunt us both for years to come.

What vexes me though is that we knew it was wrong. It's not like we did it in the open, we had some kind of idea and it would be in the closet or bedroom or somewhere private. What's even weirder is that we both turned out completely normal. I know neither of us is gay, and we actually became friends later on, he lives in New York and I'm still in Texas but he comes to our hometown and we keep in touch. That is my first confession, that my first sexual encounter was with another guy and it has been a dark horse riding along in the back of my mind for my entire life so far. I'm sorry Jack.

Second confession is more broad, and it just refers to all the women I've totally abused in my romantic history. I don't mean physically or verbally abuse, but mentally. There was one christian girl who I convinced to be friends with benefits, she had never done anything before. She was in love with me and I knew how to exploit her, I hated love and she thought she could save me. By the end she was a broken heart who was reduced to begging for me. She hated swallowing and sometimes she would fight but I would shove her head into my cock until she gagged. Then I would dump her ten seconds later and walk out while she was crying. I all but about destroyed that girl. Thank god she's happy and well adjusted, we've actually seen each other a few times and I feel that we've indirectly reconciled to be friends. I'm sorry Kate.

There were a string of girls that meant nothing in college. Sometimes I would make rounds fucking them and trying them to do embarassing, shameful, and kinky things until calling the next one after. It then became a game, how far could the envelope be pushed in one night. I have some great stories, but it was so sociopathic I'm actually ashamed. I'm sorry Sammie, I'm sorry Allie. To the rest, no apology because I think you enjoyed it as much as I did.

I've repressed these things for quite some time, and to be honest I was quite good at repressing them. Then I found this new woman. For the first time in my life I feel close in a romantic sense. She's everything I need and I think vice versa, but I can't give her everything with these dark memories in the back of my head that have been dictating my psychosexual history for two decades. That gives me more guilt than anything else, so I'm hoping by writing this out I can let it slowly wash out and become a new man, or even just a better one. I don't want to say sorry to this one.

Other than that, while we're here, fuck it. I'm sorry for stealing in the middle school lunch room. I'm sorry for stealing electronics from the high school. And to anyone I might have teased at any point in my life I'm sorry for making your life harder than it already was. That's it, now I'm going to fall asleep and hope I wake up very refreshed.


tl;dr

I had an abnormal sexual experience at a young age that has influenced every stage of my psycho-social-sexual development and those feelings resurfaced today in a strong way. I'm here to confess.

For anyone who knows the difference between the sects of Christianity, it was a Baptist household. So my upbringing was strict and I was a god-fearing goody goody for the first 15 years of my life. I couldn't date for those 15 years, I had to read the bible everyday and participate in the Christian clubs at school or suffer the consequences. I thought this was the only way to live as both of my parents and my 2 older siblings lived this way.

I'm not sure whether it was the divorce that made me question the world I was brought up in or the sudden maelstrom of hormones in my 15 year old body but I woke up to the world in the summer of that year. Since then I began rebelling against the church and hating my parents like many would have in my position. Except I was the only one. The black sheep in my family and my church.

My Dad slowly dwindled from my life and I have allowed my self to sever that particular wound but my mom is a different issue. She was the one parent who I knew had my back when I had an issue with my estranged father, bullies, teachers who weren't fit to teach anyone. But I still grew to hate her too. The Christian dogma that I was forced to listen to day in and day out, I blamed her for. If she loved me she should have respected my decision to not believe instead of forcing me to listen to old men telling me how to avoid the unavoidable human nature that they call ""sin"". That is what triggered the hate, I think.

There is nothing more pathetic in my mind than the hypocrite that was my mother. A middle aged woman of 250lbs should not be complaining about her weight when there is an unused treadmill set up in the next room for her. A divorcee clinging to book which condemns divorced women is the most pathetic of her hypocrisies. She never leaves home. She does nothing but play her stupid little game on her computer day in and day out.

At this point being around her depresses me. She is alone and depressed and wont talk about any other aspect of herself. I have my own emotional issues (which i attribute greatly to her and my dad) without having to feel like the life is sucked out of me every time she's in town. What's worse is that if I don't let myself swallow my anger and pity and spend some time with her when I can, I feel like an awful person.

It isnt that, even though I ended up with a major I did not want from the beginning, but ended up being extremely useful to me in every aspect of my life. My original goal was to major in physical therapy, it ended up being public health. With this major I was able to lose so much weight, went from 260lbs (118kgs) to 175lbs (80kgs), I feel like a new person. I am able to conduct analysis on the work environment well enough that 3 companies back where I live, Saudi Arabia, are interested in finding a position for me. 

What I feel like I wasted my time in college is I wish I was more active and social sooner instead of after I lost the weight during the last semester of college. I use to feel like everyone placed judgement on me, be it my weight, my race, or my religion. And because of my view of people, I shut myself in my apartment the whole time I was in college without making many friends, without joining clubs. I just sat at my apartment playing games on my computer being miserable for no reason at all. 

right now, I returned back home, but I have a new problem, I am suffering from a language barrier whenever I meet someone who doesn't know english. It becomes even more awkward when I cant talk to people that remember me when I was younger and end up ending the conversation as though I never meet them before. This could have been prevented if I wasnt so afraid of people and just had the courage to engage in a conversation. instead I ended up handicapping myself by losing a large portion of arabic during my time in the United States.

I want to yell at half of the posters,hopeimnotpreggo,11,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1h8a00/xpost_from_roffmychest_because_i_literally_feel/,"And I'm not a generally judgemental person but I find myself wanting to SCREAM at every person who has these ""problems"" that really are not that bad and they're acting like it's the end of the fucking world. Because I am sitting here in some really bad fucking pain and I don't have the fucking patience to find sympathy for anyone because really IT'S NOT THAT BAD!

I don't mean like metaphorical pain (that too though) I mean I can't move my neck because my boyfriend pulled my hair and threw me into the wall pain. I mean it hurts to push down the top of the soap dispenser because my boyfriend decided I wasnt listening well enough and grabbed my arms as hard as he fucking could and shook me. And what pisses me off even more is that sometimes he hurts me and theres at least bruises, but since my forearms really don't bruise easily there are just these tiny red marks that are really insignificant (minus the cut across my chest from his fingernail when he grabbed my cellphone and threw it across the room) which it's not that I want to have bruises but he always says I'm exaggerating if I dont.

Like this is pretty bad pain, I can lay here not moving and it hurts and I can't even complain about it because I'll be whining and exaggerating and he will get sick of it real quick and there are no marks to make him realize what he did. Typing and holding up my phone hurt pretty bad too because he like basically squeezed my fists together and banged them against my head/face which I guess really hurt the muscles that work my fingers idk. but i cant lay here with no distraction so I'm just typing away anyways.

I am seriously so so so sore... and constantly afraid and even though I am kicking him out like REALLY FUCKING SOON the plans keep falling through and it's so frustrating because I am in a situation where i have to rely on other peoples help and when they can help me and i just need the constant fucking fear to be over with. And even after I kick him out, it wont be because he knows where I live/work/go to school EVERYTHING SO WTF IS STOPPING HIM FROM COMING BACK AND HURTING ME?

Nothing, man. And I'm never going to be chill and happy and fucking normal because all my anxiety and stupid ptsd from my stupid fucking sexual assault is coming back because my stupid fucking boyfriend throws me around like a ragdoll. And I know I'm messy and I don't do things I say I will and I'm forgetful and I'd rather stay home than go out, and i'm very flawed. But fuck if I am not the nicest fucking person to him and everyone i meet despite getting constantly fucked over!

And oh yeah, despite having all brothers and always having guy best friends and not being able to relate very well to femininity, I now HATE men. I'm one of those girls. And don't lecture me about it either because I was a guys girl, man. I know not all men are the same but I've been hurt quite enough by men in only 20 years of life and I now fear them and hate them. I will never date again, I don't even care I'm not even lonely on my own, I just want to be in control of my life and it shouldnt even be a thing I have to ask for.

So my regularly nice, empathetic self is gone and r/offmychest and r/confessions and r/mmfb and the like are just fucking frustrating me. Because my life is fucking frustrating me. And I'm quite done.

She broke up with me 4 months ago after dating me for 2 years. We had been going through a rough patch and I thought things were getting better. She seemed to be happier. Turns out she was happier because she was about to move on...

I can't help but feel like it is all my fault. Like I wasn't good enough for her. I know I'm being stupid and she and I weren't a good match and she was probably slightly emotionally abusive. She was constantly calling me fat and saying I needed to lose weight. She didn't like the fact that at 25 I was taking some time to figure out things because I'm still getting over my mom's death (about a year and 3/4 ago) instead of doing what I went to school for (teach). She even went so far as to say that my dad had a shitty job and he should have been ashamed of it (he was a store manager in retail).

I tell everyone how bad she was and how shitty she treated me but in my head I keep thinking how amazing it would be if she called me and asked to talk because she missed me and we patched it up. It is to the point that I think I'm worthless and the depression I thought I had gotten over is catching up to me. I broke down a week or so when I was changing a tire and couldn't loosen the bolts. Just sort of... gave up threw it all down and walked inside. Feelings I thought I'd dealt with involving the death of my mom are starting to show up again.

Even though I know all of this (I've done some serious searching the last couple of months)... I'm pretty sure that I would probably take her back if she was the one to reach out.
