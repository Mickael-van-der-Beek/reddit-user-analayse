The changes are largely the work of Hungary's [Fidesz Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz), a nationalist-conservative party that won majority control in 2010, and the [Christian Democratic People's Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_People%27s_Party_%28Hungary%29). [According to some](http://www.economist.com/node/18530690?story_id=18530690&amp;fsrc=rss), changes to the Constitution have long been necessary.

The [European Commission](http://www.neurope.eu/articles/EU-asked-to-intervene-in-worrying-Hungarian-constitution/105787.php) has been asked to investigate whether the changes are compatible with EU law.

More than a month ago, I [posted a request](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/k6fkz/if_you_want_to_keep_rworldevents_special_start_by/) for users of worldevents to keep this reddit focused on its bread and butter, but advocacy posts remain consistently high scorers.

My preference would have been to let votes handle the matter, but for whatever reason, that doesn't look like it's going to work. So starting now, I'll be deleting any links to short ""articles"" (say, less than 7 paragraphs) about rallies or protests in predominantly English speaking countries.

If you got your post in before now, consider yourself lucky -- I generally don't favor ex post facto moderation. From now on, if you want to advocate for a particular cause in worldevents, do so by submitting links to in-depth articles about it.

If, on the other hand, you're dead set on submitting an advocacy post, do so in one of the 8,000+ other communities on Reddit, most of which will be more than happy to play host to your rallying call. Worldevents was created with a specific goal in mind -- that of carving out a space for the sort of current events and international news writing that isn't generally accommodated for on the rest of Reddit -- and however much I may support your cause, keeping this reddit on point means halting its gradual transformation into just another soapbox for social protest movements.",,False,,t5_2riv9,False,,,True,t3_l9kds,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/l9kds/from_here_on_out_advocacy_posts_will_be_deleted/,moderator

Lately I've noticed a lot of shorter format articles making it to the top of our ""What's hot"" queue. The reason, I suspect, is that, more and more, the voting habits we apply in other reddits are starting to take over here as well. Chief among them, it seems to me, is the habit of voting our approval (or disapproval) on a title, without first checking to see whether or not the content of the link really pairs it with the intent of the reddit.

/r/worldnews already handles shorter format news articles well, and it's neither our intent nor our capacity to compete with them on that. If /r/worldevents reshapes itself (whether intentionally or just through reddit drift) as /r/worldnews part deux, we're bound to die a slow withering death.

We regard such submissions as advocacy posts, and will remove them on sight in accordance with [a rule](http://redd.it/l9kds) that's been in place for close to five months now.

Why? There are several reasons. One is that submitters with a cause tend to be overzealous with their submitting habits. The flood of Kony submissions is a perfect example. If they had been allowed to stand, more than 1/4th of the worldevents front page would be about Joseph Kony right now, elbowing out other topics that also deserve attention. Another reason is that advocacy tends to encourage certain blind spots, and it's often difficult to tell what points in an advocacy post are grounded in fact, and which are driven more by enthusiasm for a cause.

Advocacy posts also tend to climb to the top of the queue rather quickly, and out of all proportion with other submissions in a sub. One of the Kony posts removed today had a score of nearly 150 points, which made it one of the three most popular worldevents posts of all time. That, despite concerns voiced in the comments about where the donations solicited by the video were being directed. Such popularity is understandable: we all want to get behind a good cause. But while the generosity that redditors often display when it comes to charity can be inspiring, it also makes Reddit attractive to scam artists. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that the Invisible Children group is a scam. My point is simply that allowing advocacy posts free reign on worldevents sends a message that it's okay to solicit money, and it shouldn't be the moderators' job to go through and vet every group that does so under the pretense of addressing international problems.

So... given that allowing advocacy posts would ultimately result in a front page given over to high scoring posts soliciting money and/or rallying support for causes that aren't always trustworthy -- to the exclusion of the sort of analysis and in-depth reportage that likely brought you here in the first place -- what can be done about it?

We, the mods, are willing to do our part by removing advocacy posts. All we ask of you guys is that you help out by down voting and reporting advocacy posts when you see them. If a submission to worldevents asks you to make a donation, sign a petition, or spread the word about a particular cause, consider it an advocacy post. Resist the urge to vote it up. Let us know so we can remove it from the queue. I've updated the rules and guidelines in the sidebar to make that particular rule more clear and prominent.

And just so there's no confusion, let us be clear that you *can* post articles about Joseph Kony, so long as those submissions abide by the rules.

Forums like our little corner of Reddit walk a very tenuous line. All too often, they drop off one side or the other. Go too far in one direction, and they turn into ghost towns. Go too far in the other, and they veer right back into the kind of sensationalism and frivolity that we were hoping to get away from when we started worldevents. That we haven't erred too far in either direction is due in large part to our community, so thank you all for your help in maintaining the quality of this place.

That said, here are two things I hope you'll bear in mind for the future. One is a bit of a reminder; the other is a suggestion that will hopefully make this place better.

1. **Vote for depth.** That is to say, make the depth of the contribution your main criteria when you decide how to vote. Reddit doesn't really provide an official meaning for the up and down vote, so each community and person has to decide for themselves. A lot of times, we vote simply because we agree with the position expressed in the title, or because we think a particular topic is important, regardless of how well it's handled in the specific link that was submitted. When you're voting on worldevents submissions, at least, please do your best to vote along the lines spelled out in our sidebar, but if you need a short and sweet guideline to make it more memorable, go with this: *depth*.

2. **Note the notable.** When you read an article that someone has submitted here, and you read a passage that makes you stop and think, no matter how briefly -- please, make an effort to point it out in the comments. If you can't think of anything more to say about it, just quote the passage and say you thought that it was interesting. If you can tell us *why* you found it interesting, all the better. My theory here is that, once we start noting the notable, discussions of those points will follow. Not only that, but if other users start to get a sense of what you find interesting, they might be more inclined to post links to articles about those topics when they find them, which means more of what you like to read about showing up in worldevents.

Again, thanks for all you've done so far.",,False,,t5_2riv9,1363199113.0,,,True,t3_p32fj,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/p32fj/two_ways_you_can_help_make_rworldevents_better/,moderator

In fact, my first inkling that it had happened was [this *NYT* article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/30/world/europe/30turkey.html).

&gt; In the surprising series of events, Turkey’s top commander, Gen. Isik Kosaner, together with the leaders of the navy, army and air force, simultaneously resigned in protest over the sweeping arrests of dozens of generals as suspects in conspiracy investigations that many people in Turkey have come to see as a witch hunt.

To put a finer point on it, the generals asked for, and [were granted](http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=152547), [early retirement](http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2011/08/01/feature-02) in protest of the detention of more than 250 suspected [Ergenekon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergenekon_%28organization%29) conspirators. The move represents, if nothing else, a [change of tactics](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/for-turkish-military-a-telling-change-of-tactics/2011/07/30/gIQAjZevjI_story.html) for a military accustomed to a disproportionate influence over government decisions.

That was Friday. Since then, the government has [issued assurances](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15278283,00.html) that the resignations do not constitute a crisis. [Commentators differ](http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2011/08/01/turkey-what-if-they-called-a-coup-and-nobody-came/) over the intent and effect of the move. Some are suggesting that the gesture has [misfired](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63979), with the government simply accepting the resignations and moving on. Turkey's military is known for its political involvement, and the resignations seem to [shift power](http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Turkish-PM-Convenes-Key-Meeting-After-Mass-Army-Resignations-126531093.html) to PM Erdogan, leader of Turkey's [Justice and Development Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_%28Turkey%29) (AKP).

Not least among his powers is the [discretion](http://www.hudson-ny.org/2317/turkish-government-set-to-reshape-army) to name new commanders. Those decisions are being made in [four day military meeting](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904292504576482232954932452.html?mod=googlenews_wsj) almost entirely devoid of representation by the military command. Senior command has gone to [General Necdet Ozel](http://www.todayszaman.com/news-252252-profile-of-necdet-ozel-an-army-man-with-strong-democratic-credentials.html), whose greatest virtue may be his reluctance to take side politically -- though it has been reported that he's [friendly with the government](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkeys-new-top-general-is-close-to-the-government-reports-say-2011-07-31).

In the wake of the resignations, the [Peace and Democracy Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_and_Democracy_Party) (BDP) has pushed for a greater emphasis on the fight against [Kurdish separatists](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=gov8217t-has-no-excuse-bdp-says-2011-08-01). One of Ozel's first decisions has been to increase [police involvement](http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Turkey-sees-police-role-in-Kurdish-fight-1693633.php) in that struggle.

Many in Turkey have welcomed the opportunity to exert greater [civilian control](http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/columnistDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=252458) of the army there, calling it a shift toward [""normalization""](http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-252450-the-start-of-normalization-and-a-strong-democracy.html). The AKP is also mulling the possibility of [constitutional reform](http://www.presstv.ir/detail/191859.html).

[Opposition parties](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=main-opposition-wants-answers-on-resignations-2011-08-01) like the [Repuplican People's Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_People%27s_Party_%28Turkey%29) (CHP) have since called for details on meetings that preceded, and apparently catalyzed, the resignations, even going so far as to send a [letter of complaint](http://www.todayszaman.com/news-252518-chp-deputys-complaint-againts-eu-criticized-as-meaningless.html) against the EU's rapporteur to Turkey. [Some commentators](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/eissenstat-turkeys-generals-resign.html) are less than optimistic about the AKP's increasing power. [Some Turks](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/world/europe/02turkey.html) fear their country is slipping toward authoritarian rule.",,False,,t5_2riv9,False,,,True,t3_j6uj3,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/j6uj3/i_wasnt_able_to_find_a_single_comprehensive/,

1276012037.0,55,self.worldevents,ccroa,About discussion on /r/worldevents.  Please read.,blackstar9000,67,12,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/ccroa/about_discussion_on_rworldevents_please_read/,"I've noticed a trend in the comments of posts here, and I wanted to talk about it just a little.  Here's the scenario: Someone posts a link to an article about an event that's entirely in the province of what /r/worldevents is supposed to be about.  All or most of the comments talk about it only in terms of the two big news stories of the day/week/month.

**For example**, someone posts a story about an ecological disaster in a sub-Saharan African state.  The first comments compares it to the human toll in Palestine.  Maybe there are other comments that are more on-topic.  Maybe not.

Here's the thing about comments like this: they turn everything back to the same issue, as though no other issues were worth talking about.  I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to take a small fraction of the amount of time that we spend talking about international events and devote it to talking about other world events on their own terms.

Yes, the Gaza blockade is an important international event. And yes, Israel's response to attempts to break the blockade is an important news story. But it's all over the news, all over Reddit -- ubiquitous, really. There are other stories, related stories, that are also worth exploring. So when they crop up, why don't we talk about those?

A more subtle but less related phenomenon: Someone posts about a news story.  Someone else comments about why people don't pay attention to it.

**For example**, someone posts a story about a human rights violations in South America.  The first comment satirically claims that no one cares because South America isn't Palestine.

Okay, yes, a lot of people are focused on one or two news stories to the exclusion of all else.  But /r/worldevents was set up as a place where we could talk about the stories that slip through the cracks.  None of us need to be told that the rest of the media, or the rest of Reddit, or the rest of the world for that matter, has its attention pointed elsewhere.

But it's more than just a matter of pointing out the obvious.  Comments like that reiterate the message that no one cares.  If that ends up being the first or only comment in a thread, maybe it's because we've made it a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Tell someone that no one cares about a story often enough, and they may start to believe it.

Yes, that sort of thing happens all over Reddit, and we're probably just bringing the habit in from the other subreddits we visit.  But if /r/worldevents doesn't handle the subject differently from /r/worldnews and /r/worldpolitics, then it's redundant, and we can do without it.  I don't think it has to be a clone of those other subreddits, and that's why I still have faith in subreddits like this and the capacity of the Reddit community to foster them.

Originally, this was a reply to one such comment, but I decided it was unfair to single that person out.  The fact is, I see comments like that in nearly every submission made to /r/worldevents, and it's not a single person posting them.  And I worry that it's contributing to the relative rarity of discussion around here.

**So I'm only asking two things:**

1. Try to avoid posting comments that are likely to discourage discussion; and

2. If you feel the urge to make a comment like that, stop for a moment, and think of a question about the article that you can ask instead.

Thanks for hearing me out.",,False,,t5_2riv9,True,,,True,t3_ccroa,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/ccroa/about_discussion_on_rworldevents_please_read/,

1297092310.0,53,self.worldevents,fgvy2,In which blackstar9000 explains a recent decision regarding moderation.,blackstar9000,66,13,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/fgvy2/in_which_blackstar9000_explains_a_recent_decision/,"I suspect that there's going to be some stink about this, so I want to go ahead and give /r/worldevents the story from our side.

I've just banned user [Mattanderson](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mattanderson). A quick look at his profile will help explain why. Every link he submitted to /r/worldevents until today -- and indeed, nearly every link he's posted to reddit in general -- has been to the domain wsws.org. The sheer persistence with which he's done so makes it seem likely that he's spamming for that site, and his lack of any other form of contribution to the community only strengthened that impression.

Last week I PM'd Matt to let him know how it looked from my end. I tried to be respectful and let Matt know that he could absolve himself of suspicion by simply posting links to other domains from time to time. We all have our favorite sources, so I certainly didn't expect him to give up wsws.org altogether, but some diversity would have gone a long way toward demonstrating his intent to contribute to /r/worldevents in good faith.

Matt's response was to treat my message as an attack on his political stance. Even after repeated assurance that even links to other socialist-themed websites would suffice, he continued to respond as though my intent were to suppress pro-socialist perspectives. The discussion lasted for several exchanges, but his resistance suggested a refusal to even consider broadening his posting habits.

Today, he posted a link to [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syu83BClGM8), posted by YouTube user SEPAustralia. If you look at their [user page](http://www.youtube.com/user/SEPAustralia), you'll see listed as their website, you guessed it:

&gt; Website: http://www.wsws.org

Given the resistance he put up in a private conversation, I have a hard time interpreting Matt's newest submission as anything but an attempt to sneak wsws.org material past moderation.

For the record, /r/worldevents has no moderation policy that would prejudice it against wsws.org, and any other users who find articles of interest there, or at any other socialist-themed website, are free to submit links to that material here. Mattanderson was banned not because of his political disposition, but because his involvement with /r/worldevents (and with reddit in general) is indistinguishable from spamming.

To give you a sense of the tenor with which I tried to approach the matter, the following is the first message that I sent to user Mattanderson:

&gt; **Just a head's up...**   
&gt;A number of the links you've submitted to /r/worldevents have been reported to the moderators. So far, I've approved them, but the fact that all of the links you submit are to the same domain inclines me to think you're less interested in the goals of /r/worldevents, and more intent on promoting wsws.org. The fact that your only contribution to discussion has been a defense of WSWS as a source seems to add credence to that view. In my capacity as moderator, I try to stay neutral with regards to the perspective of articles submitted to the reddit, but if you continue to post nothing but WSWS articles, and comment only in defense of those articles, I'll be inclined to treat you as a spammer in the future, and moderate accordingly.

&gt; That isn't to say that I want you to leave /r/worldevents, but I think that if you look at this objectively, you'll see how the pattern of your behavior there lends itself to the impression that you're a spammer. My hope is that you'll simply take this as a challenge to discuss other articles and diversify your posting habits.

&gt; Cheers.

If any of you have questions or concerns about this matter, feel free to post them in the comments to this thread, or to message me personally. I'll try to respond to any that are raised.

Feedback requested.,blackstar9000,44,8,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/pqw4e/important_new_rules_coming_feedback_requested/,"Don_Quijoder and I have been talking about the possibility of implementing a new rule set in /r/worldevents. Personally, I don't like to impose rules unless certain behaviors are becoming problematic, but in this case we think it's warranted. What I want to do in this thread is explain why, outline some of the rules we've been discussing, and open the floor so that the community can discuss what's best for it.

Why?
---

worldevents [started out](http://redd.it/b41r6) as a reddit dedicated to facilitating in-depth submissions and discussion. Realistically, that m.o. is it's main reason for being. If we don't insist on a different style of coverage, there's no reason why this community shouldn't close its doors and all of us simply take what we're doing back to /r/worldnews and /r/worldpolitics.

Lately, we've been getting a number of submissions that aren't really appropriate for worldevents in that they don't adhere to the standards spelled out in the sidebar. Chances are, that trend is only going to continue until the sort of content worldevents was created to foster gets pushed out by content that's easier to digest. Some of the cosmetic changes we've recently made (like the Vote Fader in the sidebar and the message under the title field on the submit page) were meant to encourage the community to think more about the sort of content they submit and how they vote. I've also made a few [direct](http://redd.it/k6fkz) [appeals](http://redd.it/p32fj). It's growing increasingly clear that those strategies aren't going to work.

That leaves us with two options: 1) let worldevents gradually morph into a worldnews clone, or 2) implement some rules to maintain what distinguishes worldevents from other reddits about international news. We're going with the latter.

The plan so far
---

These are the rules that Don_Quijoder and I have been discussing behind the scenes. The precise wording is subject to change.

&gt; 1. The focal point of any submission should be either analysis of a current event, or in-depth background that provides context relevant to a current event -- all links to breaking stories or plain reportage will be removed at the moderators' discretion.

&gt; 2. Questions submitted to the new queue must be submitted as text.posts, and only essay- and discussion-style questions will be allowed -- i.e. no rhetorical questions; no yes/no questions; no requests for simple statements of fact (e.g. Who is the current president of Thailand?).

&gt; 3. Submissions will be removed by the moderators if the title features descriptive terms, or issues claims, not made in the content of the linked-to article or media.

&gt; 4. Photos and collections of photos are not allowed, and should be submitted to /r/photoessay instead.

I want to point out that I regard that first rule as potentially dangerous. It make the mods' discretion the primary standard for determining whether or not a post is appropriate, and that makes *our* subjective assessments a much bigger factor in how this reddit operates. It is, for that reason, worth discussing. But it's also important that we have a rule that covers the ground that rule covers, so something like it *will* be put in place. If anyone has suggestions for a less subjective rule, we'd love to discuss it.

Rule #3 is adapted from a rule set I helped concoct for /r/RepublicOfPolitics. The purpose is to exclude sensationalistic and misleading headlines. The easiest way to make sure that you don't run afoul of this rule is to simply cut &amp; paste some part of the article text and make that the title of your submission.

Okay, that's it for now. If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions, now is the time to voice them.",,False,,t5_2riv9,False,,,True,t3_pqw4e,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/pqw4e/important_new_rules_coming_feedback_requested/,

Egyptians recently voted in a [referendum](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12763313) on proposed constitutional changes. Opinions on what the referendum meant for the still [nascent revolution](http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/spotlight/anger-in-egypt/2011/03/20113159273349129.html) were divided. [Secular opposition](http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/secular-coalition-too-disorganised-to-win-egyptian-referendum) proved to be highly disorganized. The referendum passed by a wide margin, but showed an [increasing polarization](http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&amp;cat=ArabWorld&amp;article=4020) among citizens. Some have suggested that the 77.2% of votes in favor were largely intended to maintain stability while putting a limit on the [interim military rule](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060692,00.html). As a result, the military has issued an [interim constitution](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/30/egypt-constitution-idUSLDE72T1KT20110330). It promises parliamentary elections in September, with [presidential elections](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i5chfHpXwUvXcdCuDX9uDjC_0Lxg?docId=CNG.bfb8229dcf908f07a113483065bb30aa.601) to follow in a month or two.

In preparation for those elections, various interest groups are portioning themselves off into political parties, though critics say the [provisions for official recognition](http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/379401) are too stringent and will hamstring legitimate elections. Supporters of Mubarak's son Gamal have formed a coalition called [al-Sahwa al-Arabiya](http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/378824) (The Arab Renaissance). The Muslim Brotherhood is forming a party called [Freedom and Justice](http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/378974), and has invited Coptic Christians to join; some Copts have [already declined](http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/380362). To consolidate support, [liberal parties](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=egypt8217s-liberal-parties-merge-2011-03-30) are merging and urging other liberal groups to join their coalition. The head of the Karama Socialist Party, [Hamdeen Sabahi](http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/8943/Egypt/Politics-/Socialist-Hamdeen-Sabahi-announces-he%E2%80%99s-running-fo.aspx), has announced his intention to run for president as an independent.

The military announced on Monday that it would lift the country's decades-old [emergency laws](http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2011/03/29/egypt_will_lift_emergency_laws/) prior to September elections. Meanwhile, the youth movement remains active, at least on [college campuses](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134928357/egypts-college-campuses-rocked-with-unrest). This, despite a hugely unpopular [anti-protest law](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8484/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-protests-against-antiprotest-law-.aspx). According to human rights groups, [abuses against protesters](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-24/world/egypt.revolution_1_ban-protests-female-demonstrators-cairo-s-tahrir-square?_s=PM:WORLD) were still taking place as recently as last week. Reports of violence at the hands of Salafis have stoked fear of [rising Islamic force](http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/380050).

The new prime minister, Nabil al-Araby, started his interim appointment by offering to [reopen ties](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8881/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt%E2%80%99s-foreign-minister-Iran-is-not-an-enemy-stat.aspx) with Iran; Iran [welcomed the overture](http://www.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Iran-Welcomes-Egypts-Call-to-Mend-Relations-118911349.html). Zahi Hawass was reappointed [minister of antiquities](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i2JVifEYiqojJkfmiwSLj22tg7uQ?docId=CNG.bfb8229dcf908f07a113483065bb30aa.281), a move that could anger those who demanded that Mubarak's entire cabinet be removed from power. And in the wake of Japan's ongoing Fukushima crisis, Egypt has suspended and may cancel its still recently revived [nuclear program](http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/379811). The [Egyptian stock market](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jT0MiJHbvWPloao-hsQngnHamv-Q?docId=8fe34891033141fda35ccda80d1f5600) showed signs of rallying, potentially signaling the end of weeks of economic slowdown in the wake of the Tahrir square demonstrations.
