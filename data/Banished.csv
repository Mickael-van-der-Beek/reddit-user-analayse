1364510962.0,28,self.Banished,1b7g3e,"My thoughts on realism, gameplay and dangers",Zakerias,31,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Banished/comments/1b7g3e/my_thoughts_on_realism_gameplay_and_dangers/,"Like most people here the appeal of this game to me is the realism, the prospect of a deep city simulation and lovely graphics. I'm not someone who is eager to support crowdfunded projects (so far only Prison Architect), but this game I would definitely support.

Here is a few things I would like to see:

Realism:

* No magic whatsoever. I want to build a medieval village/city. Alchemists, fortune tellers, herbalists or quackery are fine. But for once I would like a historical game instead of a fantasy setting.
* No unlockables. No 'raise 500 cows to unlock the Pink Barn'. No imaginary power ups by reaching a certain number of anything. Everything should become available naturally.

Gameplay:

* I would like the villagers to have a personality. A good example is Tropico. Those people live and breath. I would love to see Knut Workhard to be very skilled at chopping wood, so he would be an asset to your village. But Dick Cutpurse is a lazy bum who steals your goods. I'd rather have 20 citizens that I know, then 500 that are nothing but an achievement. 
* In addition to the above: I would like to have the option to banish citizens that are criminal, not productive or simply because you can. On the other hand you could also name certain citizens as noblility, placing them above the others, if you want to. 
* Randomness. This one is a bit difficult to describe, but I like games that offer something unexpected, but not in a crucial way. For instance: when you chop down a few trees there is a small chance you can find some seeds for, let's say, pumpkins. The benefit of these pumpkin seeds won't give you a big advantage, they aren't very valuable, but the fact that you found these rare seeds makes the game you play a bit more personal. The same could apply for villagers. What if one of your citizen is disabled, blind for example. He/she couldn't work as efficient, but would require food and shelter. Do you care for this person? Or do you simply banish him/her for being a burden? 

Dangers:

* I read the creator didn't want any combat, no PvP. Which I think is great. Other people, or other NPC, shouldn't be able to influence how you play. 
* I would like natural dangers, since it's a city sim/survival game. Boar nests could ruin your farmland, wild animals could attack your children, fire could start in abandoned houses, etc.
* Bandits (think small, not armies) could settle outside town and attack your merchants. This way the threat isn't directly inside the village but would make trading and traveling risky.


Other stuff:

* 100% customizable maps settings / map editor 

So far, I think much of the above is allready in the little information we've seen, but I hope the game will take this direction.

I had a few thoughts about what I'd like to see in the combat system (well, more specifically, managing your military) so I thought I'd jot them down. I know /u/pomesuba also said ""I don’t want to give much away as combat is just a design on paper and I’d want to prototype and test before giving anything away,"" but I thought I'd share my thoughts anyway in case the developer liked any of them and to spark a community discussion. Before I go on I'd like to say I totally support the idea of being able to play the game entirely without having to fight if you don't want to. As you'll see below I've also tried to emphasise the cost of war being a major factor anyway. The ideas below are based in part around what I know of the historical realities of the Anglo-Saxon military and the way armies were recruited, fielded and maintained during this period. I know that Banished isn't set in this period (you can grow potatoes, for one thing) but I still think it is quite accurate of a model for whatever period Banished is set in. I'd personally like to eventually see a mod that turns it into an Anglo-Saxon/Norse setting.

**Military unit types and recruitment**

* Armies in general are quite small, perhaps ~120 units.

* Military units are of two types: household troops and mustered troops.

* Household troops are permanently at arms, are well trained and equipped (heavy infantry or cavalry) and can be deployed rapidly.

* They are also expensive to maintain and require lots of facilities (training yards, blacksmiths).

* A muster can be called and a proportion of your whole population will come to war.

* They are cheap, impermanent units of medium or light infantry or missile troops that take time to muster and deploy.

* In battle the household troops act as elite units and commanders. The player can decide whether to disperse his household troops amongst the muster (good for holding defensive lines) or aggregate his household guards (good for a very strong offensive unit).

* A large population of bachelors gets restless and warlike.

* Can cultivate a large population of bachelors by building communal living halls.

* Mustering could occur at muster points (a normal building) around which encampments would be constructed during the muster. It is from this building the call to arms is issues and the army disbanded.

* A system could be implemented that allowed the player to make choices like what proportion of the population would be mustered, how much military service each individual would owe the player per year, whether eligible citizens were required to train autonomously, that kind of thing.

* Obviously the greater each of those values is, the better your army is but the more costly it is to muster and maintain.



**Grouping**

* Detailed command of the army can be taken by allocating your army into different units. The player can mix and match the troop types in each unit as they please.

* Groups can be selected using the number keys as well as by clicking.

* Grouping could affect factors like morale, movement speed, etc.



**Formations**

* Total War-like click and drag dynamic formation placement.

* Shield wall (defensive and offensive anti-infantry).

* Tortoise (defence against missile troops)

* Square (anti-cavalry).

* Wedge/boar-snout charge (aggressive anti-infantry).

* No formation means faster movement, but formations are very necessary when engaging in combat.

* Better troops are better at formations and less disorganised.



[**Fortifications**](http://www.essentialnormanconquest.com/images/osehncimages/osehnc01801.JPG) (a picture of what I'd like to be able to build, an Anglo-Saxon burh)

* Relatively simple fortifications can be built. It would be nice to have very flexible placement and orientation and powerful and simple placement tools (for example, taking just a few clicks to place a large circular rampart/palisade) but I don't know if the game engine will support it.

* More complicated fortifications like town walls can be staffed by a small rotating non-professional muster, while simpler earthworks just act as a passive defence (e.g. dykes prevent the theft of the player's livestock or the unauthorised passage of large groups of NPCs).

* However, formations of troops can interact with all fortifications in meaningful ways, so troops manning a dyke will stand at the top and defend it against hostile troops attempting to cross.

* It would also be nice if the system of fortifications could interact well with the system of terrain elevation so the player could construct terrain features like moats, mottes, canals and berms.



I hope you liked my thoughts. I hope that they have a good deal of tactical depth while not being over complicated, as well as implementing real-world dynamics in a way that I think is very much in keeping with what I've seen of Banished. They're very far from complete, but I'd be grateful if you all would let me know your thoughts.

Combat could be designed more around town defense and small drunken raiding parties to eliminate nuisance threats.

The more we venture out into the woods the more we provoke.  Making use of lookout posts or watchtowers, archers, basic weapons, simple soldiers, and even drunken mobs.  We could have wolves, trolls, bears, and bandits. Or even specific enemies (think big bad wolf) taking people that wander out alone.  Once killed mounted as trophies maybe.

Then every 15 stops or so [so it feels like a long seasonal trip to trade], there would be a big NPC trade post, where people could sell like a commodities market, and there would be a transaction fee to have the money couriered back to your village.

If you manage the fees appropriately, people will still be able to use trading posts, but a trade economy will develop where people get rich as merchants physically traveling around the map. (If you can't raise the fee, but there are still no merchants, make an expensive ship that allows you to carry more). The goal would be that the profit margin on shipping goods from one trade post to another would be high enough, that it would let people manually ship  (have overland roads for shipping (no need to load all the villages if you aren't stopping through.)?) between posts for a profit. [sending food to the mountains and returning with iron, e.g.]

Letting people host their own servers for a group of friends would be cool. 

 **To balance the game**, there should be one map with perhaps 200 slots on it. that would make about 12 trading posts. In each of the fifteen village sections, their maps could have resources distributed (procedurally) in a ""circle of distributions"" (because the river is a circle, remember. (or maybe it is two rivers, with a bay, and a short overland road, idk). The mountains would be rich in iron and stone, out of the mountains would have the forests, then the plains (deer/wood and farming, respectively), the ocean would have ????salmon fishing in the rivers???? The key is that every village would have every resource (except maybe the mountains and oceans wouldn't overlap, the oceans and the mountains could be for advanced players who like a challenge?), but the ammounts would vary with location.

The idea would be that each map would have some of everything, in the borders of two regions (like mountains, but below the tree line) the villages would have a few of both.  Resources would be limited by how much each area COULD devote to that resource. So the plains has room for lots of farms, but **little** (not none) exposed rock for a quarry, etc. That would induce trading of excess. But it would also encourage shippers, because a ton of food in the plains does nothing for the people in the mountains in the winter. Quarrying would be at a constant rate/area, trees would grow randomly at a certain rate if the average tree density drops below the threshold for that map, and would die if they ever got over the threshold. Farming would be the growing season and health of the crops (too much salt near the ocean), hunting would be proportional to the amount of forest, so as forest cities grow, they hunt less, meaning they NEED to trade for food from the plains. Mountain villages are hard mode, because they need to trade almost immediately, but at least their vast iron reserves gives them the money they need to do it... if they don't die in the winter.

As an extension to the hunting remark: As your village grows, there is less space to ""mine"" your resources so there is a harmony that will develop. BUT if we add the ability to let our villagers move (use houses as ""people storage"") then trade alliances could form where highly educated miners come down in the winter for a price to craft things for the villages, or trade alliances could have an administrative city with no actual resource mining, but holds all the storage and trading ships, and is well defended (if combat is added), and educates workers, etc. This would be how combat would work. To help a village defend, you would loan units, if you trusted your friend not to get them all killed! Then the player that loaned the people could bring them back by going to the village and ""buying"" them for free, or having the other player ""sell"" them for free. IF you wanted to make it as a work-hire program, you would set a price in the transaction, and what percentage is upfront, and what percentage is on return. (The riskier the deal, the more up front, or just more in total, hard choices to be made.) This is where stone comes into play: it is needed for larger (higher up the tech tree) buildings, or to build lower tech tree buildings that are fire proof (to stop raids). Combat is hard this way because it needs to be asynchronous. Also then we get a progression of time even while not playing. 

What this possibly means for yearly (game time) (maybe every 10 days RT) seasonal effects: Spring floods: no upstream motion. Salmon runs near the oceans at the right time. Winter: no farm growth, better have stores or you will need to buy food from the hunters.)

What this means for people hosting their own servers: If 10 people are hosting their own servers, they will place their villages to get some of all the resources (which will be a balance, instead of ten farmers, etc.) 

What this means for the idea of a server in general: you could make the servers any size you want. Just scale up the size by stretching the procedural distribution, and increasing the number of trade posts/ the number of villages between posts. you could even have the size of the servers different for people who want different experiences. A smaller server would keep prices from crashing and allow a sense of community. It would also allow alliances if you ever add combat. There would be strain between trade alliances and combat alliances, because people near by would want to defend each other, but people nearby are trade enemies! 

**On bandwidth** The heaviest use of bandwidth would be loading people's villages when others go to trade, and that is purely fluff/immersion. If you wanted to, you could have people ""go down/up the river"" (take a boat to the edge of the map) and it brings up a menu. Then all that trading would ensue is little files telling the name of the village, what it is selling and at what price. Then every ten minutes or so, (or instantaneously), the new trade file would be updated on the village owner's computer if they are playing. If you need to, you could impose a ""can't change your bulletin board more than once per ten minutes"" rule. 


**Super hard mode** you voluntarily get a village with no river, no trading, all you get is one yearly trip to the nearest trade depot... make it count.

**The battle, worker giving, and seasonal effects all present problems to having a multiplayer experience** how would one handle battle between two people where one is not on? How could you have synchronized seasonal events, if peoples' villages pause while they are not playing? And if villages are paused while they are not playing, what stops people from lending workers to each other everytime they get off? (I guess you would have to feed the extra people, or have your consumption/production rates recorded, and have the server update your stores appropriately.) But everyone hates having a tamagotchi  (sp?) die on them because they got busy with school. 

**TL;DR:** Trading and worker giving are two things that could probably work.  For fighting, I guess you could ""send units"" and they would just be gone until the other player logged on, and the units would fight with AI? Asynch fighting seems a little freemium iOS-ish to me, but the trading of goods and workers see to work well (given that there is some sort of time progression when you aren't on, so that you can't loan all your workers away right before you get off).

End wall of text. I'm interested in thoughts/reactions.

EDIT/ADDITION: So I actually got around to reading this: http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/?page_id=680 And it seems like my thoughts are kind of in tune with the goal of the game. (I don't know how I feel about foresters actively planting trees, I think it would be better randomized, but that's just me.) The medicine idea is cool, but maybe if this vastly different maps idea catches on, each map would have medicinal ingredients that could be used to heal different ailments. (all would have something like a fever reducer). OH! and mountains would have fur, forest and plains would have hide/leather. So fur makes warm clothing, and hide makes goods and kind of warm clothing, what of cotton on the plains? Chickens would die in the winter unless they had coop space, cows would survive winter in the plains, but maybe it would be too snowy in the mountains? And you would need grass from the plains to feed them, so it would make it tough work, and easier to trade for cured meat, which needs to be smoked, which needs wood from the forest (if you run out on your map?).",,False,self,t5_2wp64,1364057181.0,,,True,t3_1av4co,http://www.reddit.com/r/Banished/comments/1av4co/i_was_reading_the_multiplayer_post_and_this/,

Even though I would LOVE for that to happen...part of me is worried about how this would be a negative thing.  The more popular a product gets, the higher the expectations become.  With this being a one-man studio, it will be easy to become overwhelmed.  

What I'm worried about is the staggering amount of people who don't understand the purpose of playing a game in it's alpha state.  It's probably a loud, vocal minority, but it seems like numerous people expect a finished product in alpha-funded games and then go on the forums to just bitch out the dev with non-constructive posts.

Regardless, from what I've see in the trailer and gameplay video, I'd be wiling to fund the game right now and wait.  The fact that he's been working on this game for years helps too.  I just WANT this game to happen.  It looks refreshing, seems to stem from alot of favorite oldies and I've been digging this genre lately.

I was thinking there could be a longer term apprentice style program such that the quality/output of the villager increases each year from 33/66/100% from the 1st to 3rd years as they are taught. After three years they graduate, becoming a fully qualified.  



I'm not sure what would happen if you do not have someone that has mastered a profession.  Perhaps they would be a novice, teaching them self so that their productivity would only max out to a fraction of a trained professional, say 60-80% productivity.  However, as they teach others, their students would take what they learn, plus learn more on their own terms, so now 75-95% or so.  This would mean after 3 or so generations, you would finally have a true master (100% productivity) in the profession that could teach others to the max potential.



There can also be bonuses to this too, such that perhaps there are ""gifted"" teachers that can knock a year or so off this normal requirement.  Or that after the third year, the student becomes 110% production permanently.

It looks like a relaxed medieval-settlement simulator that does not involve combat, thank god, and has fairly-deep mechanics.

The one thing that's a bit bothering me, and it's probably going to be addressed by the time of release, is the game's art. Not so much the shapes of the buildings and whatnot, but more the lack of variety in the color pallet. I think that the menus can be more than just grey and the farms can have more color added to them.

The reason this bothers me a bit is that in such games the player is going to be staring at the town for quite a while, and it needs to be appealing to look at. Banished is showing nothing bad, but it could be much much better. I'd go to Anno 1404 (known also as Dawn of Discovery) for a game that manages to make the pallet varied and great to look at. Even older games like the Caesar and Pharaoh series managed to look great even though they were sprite-based games.
