Most of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and it’s certainly a great source of collective knowledge on many topics. But there’s one thing that I’ve noticed people here are not good at: acne. The best we’ve managed as a collective is ""put a clean towel on your pillow every night"". But in reality, there is no cure, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. Dirty skin is not likely to be the real cause, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know how frustrating that is, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, or lead to more problems. It's made especially hard because the Internet is filled with misinformation and ignorance about how to treat acne, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. 

I've tried to extract the useful information from all this, approaching the problem from various angles rather than recommending a specific product or regimen. Despite what people in almost every reddit acne thread keep telling you (and there has been a lot of awful advice in those threads), there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skin care and acne before you can understand how to treat your own problems, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.

**Basic Acne Treatment**

Before continuing, I suggest reading [this](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/best-acne-fighting-products.aspx) summary of acne, its causes, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/), though questionable at times, is worth reading through for more info. It also has user reviews of every product, home remedy and other treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information like that, but be careful, as there's also a lot of unreliable advice and anecdotes. Remember, what works for someone else may not work for you, and sometimes people make mistakes when assessing their own results.

You can get a reasonable amount of detail from those links (and more from checking Wikipedia/Google results for anything listed there), and I suggest reading them before this FAQ. I'm just going to summarise the pros and cons of some common acne treatments. (You can see a fairly comprehensive list [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Acne_agents).)

*Benzoyl Peroxide (BP)*

* Examples: [Acne.org](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/product/clear-acne-fighting-treatment/acne-treatment-clear-skin), [Serious Skin Care](http://www.seriousskincare.com/product_p/clearzitnano.htm) (5% only, but no other product effectively combines benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil), [Oxy](http://www.oxyskincare.com/our-products/oxy-clinical-clearing-treatment/) (5% only), [ProActiv](http://www.proactiv.com)

Pros:

* Kills acne bacteria better than anything else you can get OTC, strong support from studies.
* Also has some keratolytic effects due to its skin peeling properties, so it can clear pores.
* Widely available and commonly used, relative to comparable products.

Cons:

* Dries out skin
* High sun sensitivity (use sunscreen)
* Bleaches clothes and sheets
* It can be harsh, irritating and drying: many people will have some kind of negative reaction, and those who are allergic or have sensitive skin can't tolerate it at all. (I don't use BP for this reason. If you do, I recommend trying a 2.5% product, as stronger ones have worse side effects, and there's little evidence that they're more effective.)

*Salicylic Acid / Beta Hydroxy Acid / BHA*

Examples: [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/category/bha-aha-exfoliants), [Neutrogena](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/oil-free+acne+stress+control-+3-in-1+hydrating+acne+treatment.do)

Pros:

* Best exfoliant: helps remove dead skin and encourage new growth, which both prevents pore blocking and improves hyperpigmentation (red/dark marks).
* Unclogs pores and restores them to their healthy size/funtion, excellent for blackheads/whiteheads.
* Anti-inflammatory.
* Can and should be spread all over the face to improve appearance and smoothness, not just as a spot treatment.

Cons:

* Sun sensitivity (always use sunscreen!)
* Still can't be used by some, especially if you have an aspirin allergy or salicylate sensitivity

*Other Exfoliant Info*

* Alpha Hydroxy Acids (usually glycolic or lactic acid) are an alternative if your skin can't tolerate BHAs, but do not penetrate as deep into the skin, so they don't work as well against acne (but they do help with surface damage).
* Physical scrubs only exfoliate superficially, not penetrating the skin like AHAs/BHAs, and their abrasive nature also means they can be more irritating (and more likely to accidentally scrub pimples), so these are not recommended. If you are going to go with a scrub, try to make it a fairly gentle one, or just use a washcloth with your cleanser.
* I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, but most BHA products have too high a pH to exfoliate, or contain ingredients that make acne worse. Good ones are hard to find, so I would recommend getting them from Paula's Choice. They're the only brand that has a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (liquid/gel/lotion), so you can find the right fit for your skin type.
* Start by using them once a day, at night, and if necessary, adjust the frequency based on how your skin responds.

*Tea Tree Oil*

Pros:

* [Functionally comparable to benzoyl peroxide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2145499) 
* Doesn't have the drying or irritating side effects of BP

Cons:

* Weaker than BP; takes longer to work and may have a lower success rate.
* Lack of good tea tree products available, most are unlikely to be effective. 
* Highly volatile, may lose effectiveness from exposure to light or air. Be careful with the below method; buy small quantities and store it carefully.

The best way to get around the poor availability of good products is to buy 100% tea tree oil, and dilute it to 5% (i.e. 1:19) concentration in a carrier oil, such as jojoba. (Camellia oil and grape seed oil are a couple touted for their skin benefits, but I'm not sure if they block pores.) A few drops of jojoba can double as a light, noncomedogenic moisturiser, suitable even for oily skin. You don't really want to be using creams and lotions on oily skin anyway, as they risk making it oilier or clogging pores. I wouldn't rush to add TTO to other skin products, unless you just mix them in your hands before application. 

A similar product, called manuka oil, is made from a New Zealand plant (usually used to make a highly antibacterial honey), rather than the Australian tea tree. I haven't heard much about this being used for acne, but if anyone has tried it, let me know how it went. It's possible that this is just as effective as tea tree, or more so, but either it's obscure because of the lack of studies on it, or has so few studies on it because it's obscure.

*Azelaic Acid*

Pros:

* Combines some of the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and exfoliant/pore-clearing effects of the above products (I believe you need sunscreen with it for similar reasons).
* Generally well-tolerated, usable on sensitive skin.
* Very effective for hyperpigmentation left behind by acne (currently considered a possible safer alternative to hydroquinone for skin lightening)

Cons:

* Poor availability: Whether it's OTC or prescription-only varies with the country. So far, the only place I know for certain it's OTC is Australia, where you can get the 20% lotion (Azclear) or 15% gel (Finacea). Some online stores will ship these internationally. I wasn't really sure whether this belonged here or in the prescription treatment section, but if you do reach the point of needing prescription topicals, this is a really good one to try anyway.
* Some people may have bad side effects, especially in the first couple of weeks. I find it needs to be followed with a moisturiser.
* Relative lack of research into its usage, effectiveness and precautions. Generally speaking, fewer people seem to have used it, so it's hard to assess how good it is.

Remember that any of these will most likely take several weeks to start working, as acne that is already forming can take some time to come to the surface. If you want to know where to start, I suggest salicylic acid (or an AHA), then if it doesn't do enough on its own, try combining it with tea tree oil or BP. Azelaic acid is a great alternative, if you can get access to it. If these fail, you may want to see a doctor or dermatologist for stronger options. Before you do any of this, though, I recommend reading through the next few sections that cover how to look after your health, hygiene and skin in a way that will minimise your acne, which may save you needing to go further or spend more money.

I am well aware that parts of the guide are messy right now, as I haven't had the time to put in to editing them. Feedback and suggestions are appreciated, on both the content and formatting/structure. If you think there's something missing, I want to know about it. This guide will continue to be edited for the foreseeable future, evolving based on community input and new discoveries.**

I did away with the version numbers, as they didn't really seem to have any point, and thus far the guide has only been posted roughly once per year anyway. And it's not really a fixed ""version"" when I'm constantly updating it. There's a new post now because almost every section in the guide has either been totally rewritten, or heavily edited, and I've changed the structure a bit as well. 

If I feel a need to do another significant revamp, you might see a 2014 version, but that's not really on my mind for now, as there's a lot that we can still do to improve this one. In particular, the appendices, which are in separate comments so that people can reply to each one with their discussions/suggestions/requests, haven't had much done yet.

One thing I've taken a lot more care with this time around is providing actual sources that allow you to see where a lot of this information came from - at the very least, I try to link to reviews/meta-analyses and base what I say on their conclusions. That's not to say that what you read before was wrong - the biggest factual error I found was the claim that white tea has less caffeine than green tea ([not true!](http://tealove.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/white-tea-and-caffeine/)), which isn't the most material detail in a guide about acne. But the old guide was mostly based on memory and notes I'd made, and having sources allowed me to be more precise and confident, as well as to fill in details I'd missed. I haven't done this for everything, but most points that I felt really needed citations now have them.

Anyway, on with the guide!

# ***Introduction: An Acne Reading List***

Most of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and it’s certainly a great source of collective knowledge on many topics. But there’s one thing that I’ve noticed people here are not good at: acne. The best we’ve managed as a collective is ""put a clean towel on your pillow every night"". But in reality, there is no cure, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. The root cause isn't dirty skin, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't necessarily work for you, and sometimes, most of the things that SHOULD work don't. Some of us deal with constant frustration, trying countless products over months and years. I always found that even the best ones weren't enough, or they just made things worse. Figuring it out is especially hard because the Internet is so full of misinformation and ignorance, and it's no easy feat to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap found on most acne-related websites.

This guide was started as an attempt to sort through the nonsense and actually give people useful information, backed up by science wherever possible. It's a problem that needs to be tackled from multiple angles, so the usual approach of recommending a particular product or regimen simply isn't enough. Despite what you may have been told by the many acne threads across reddit (and there has been a lot of awful advice in those threads), there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skin care and acne before you can understand how to treat your own problems, and the approach you take to treating it will depend a lot on your own skin, the nature of your acne, and the underlying factors making it worse.

You might expect a guide like this to start off with an explanation of what acne is, why people get it, and how it forms. But frankly, there are a thousand other acne websites and guides and posts across the Internet that already do this, and many of them do it better than I could. Before continuing, I recommend reading over at least some of the below pages to get a good sense of how and why acne occurs. This is a good way to get into the right mindset when it comes to treating it, and avoid a lot of common mistakes and misconceptions. 

* [acne.org](http://www.acne.org/about-acne.html) has a lot of info, ""the basics"" section is a good start. (Be warned that while acne.org is nice for some things, there's questionable information there as well. I've noticed that the site's owner can be somewhat narrow-minded in his views of things he does and doesn't like, and of how he thinks acne should be treated, while understating the potential of alternatives and the role of things like diet.) Also see [this forum post detailing common mistakes](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/).)
* [Cosmetics Cop/Paula's Choice: All About Acne](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/acne/_/all-about-acne) (also see their other acne articles [here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/acne/))
* /r/skincareaddiction: [Acne Basics](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/164hw3/acne_information_the_basics_patient_information/) and [Beyond the Basics](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/164hq9/acne_information_beyond_the_basics_patient/)
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_vulgaris)
* [A brief summary of the four factors involved in the pathogenesis of acne](http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/101/basics/aetiology.html), and [a less brief summary with a handy diagram](http://www.jpad.org.pk/April%20June%202010/8.Review%20article%20Pathogenesis%20of%20acne.pdf). Anything that works for acne needs to address at least one of these, so it gives you a good idea of how to think about treatments.
* Suggest more pages for this list!

1360483496.0,127,self.acne,188mha,I've had acne for a long time and finally cured it. Here's a huge post of guidelines to follow that will probably cure yours too.,ljktklrjht,155,28,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/188mha/ive_had_acne_for_a_long_time_and_finally_cured_it/,"Basically, do as many of these at a time. Some may impact your acne slightly, some a great deal, and some not at all. I'd be pretty surprised if you still have acne if you follow all of these guidelines. You may have heard some of these already.

Also, a lot of the items on this list will not be skin irritants for you. For example, dyes and perfumes don't bother everyone. But I don't know if they bother me so I just avoid them. Even if you think you aren't bothered by them you may be. It's not like there's a shortage of products. If anything, avoiding common skin irritants just makes choosing products easier.

About me: I'm a 20 year old male who had acne for 6 or so years and spent a lot of time researching how to beat it. I obtained a lot of knowledge from reddit so I felt like giving back. I'm on a throwaway so feel free to upvote for visibility so we can cure everyone's acne.

Without further adieu..

* Change your pillowcase daily. If you're poor just buy a bunch of cheap white towels from Walmart. If you're lazy just rest your head on clean shirts. Also if you flip it over you can get a couple uses out of it.
* Dyes and perfumes irritate many peoples skins. Choose a detergent without these chemicals when doing the wash.
* Don't use a fabric softener. Can be irritating.
* Avoid dairy. This one actually cured my acne. I didn't eat much cheese but when I stopped my face completely cleared up. If you search [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) you will see a lot of studies showing a link between dairy and acne. Again, with some people there is no correlation at all. It depends on your genetics.
* The other dietary link to acne for some people is food high on the glycemic index. The glycemic index measures how quickly blood sugar levels rise after eating some food. Basically, try a paleo diet and cutting out sweets.
* Try to use lukewarm water. Very hot and very cold water irritates and dries out the skin. Contrary to popular belief, pore size is genetically determined and steam does not ""open pores.""
* While I'm on the subject, acne is interesting because it is one of those things in life that you have to kill with kindness. Harsh scrubbing will just exacerbate your acne further. It's a good metaphor for problem solving.
* Don't overwash your skin. For most people washing their face twice a day works best. With others once a day is actually better. However, rarely is it the case that washing his or her face more than three times a day gives better results.
* Prefer chemical exfoliation over manual. AHA's like Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid and BHA's like Salicylic Acid are generally considered superior to physical exfoliation products because they don't irritate the skin (kill acne with kindness). A lot of people prefer BHA's for their anti-inflammatory properties.
* Prefer low concentrations of chemicals. Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) kills Propionibacterium acnes, the acne bacterium. If that is the sole cause of your acne it won't be much longer with BP treatments. That doesn't mean you should get a 10% BP product though. Studies have shown that 2.5% is just as effective without drying and irritating the skin as much. Also, don't apply it too often because you can get chemical burns. That happened to me a couple years ago when I was still a novice to acne research. Healed completely thankfully.
* Is acne only at one spot on your face? Only your shoulders or forehead, for example? Then the cause is likely something that touches those parts of your body, like greasy sheets or bangs. Try washing both with a detergent more often.
* Drink a lot of water. I'm sure you've heard this before in many different contexts. It's human fuel. 3 days without and you're done. Drink more water. How do you know if you're drinking enough? Your pee should be clear instead of yellow.
* Have a healthy diet. Acne is mostly caused internally and shows itself externally. You're probably deficient in Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids, even with a good diet. Vitamin D is pretty much only obtained through direct sunlight and sunscreen/cloudy days/winter time prevents it from being synthesized. Also, the sun is bad because it causes skin cancer. Wear suncreen, hats, and take Vitamin D supplementation for optimal health. You can pretty much only get sufficient Omega 3's from a fishy diet and expensive grass-fed meats so I just supplement it instead. I only supplement Vitamin D and Fish Oil because even with an *okay* diet you're probably only deficient in those two things.
* If you move around a lot during sleep and your face is rubbing against a harsh fabric or oils it could irritate your skin. Try sleeping on your back with proper pillow positioning to maintain a neutral spine. Personally I have a bad back so I have to sleep on my side and just try not to move around too much.
* Don't touch your face. Your hands, and fingers especially, are probably dirty, or at least oily and greasy. The only time you touch your face is while you're washing your face and are cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing/whatevering.
* Don't pick at your skin or squeeze parts of your skin. The only time you should really do this is after you've washed your hands during your skincare routine and should only attempt it if it's ready to pop and you only need to apply a small amount of pressure in order to release it.
* Don't use any product that clogs your pores. [Here's a list](http://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html) of comedeogenic ratings for products. Comedeogenic just means tendency to clog pores. This list doesn't mean that something with a 4 will definitely clog your pores though (depends on skin type/genetics/etc). Some people are fine with coconut oil, for example. I just chose to skip that step and just go with products rated a 0 like Shea Butter.
* Use a moisturizer if your skin is dry. How do you know if your skin is dry? Well, hours after your skin care regimen or after you wake up, is your skin dehydrated at all? Do you have any crusted skin near your eye area or does your skin feel really tight and not elastic? You may also only need to moisturize certain areas (combination skin). See how your skin normally feels without it and react accordingly.
* Cleanse your skin during your skin care routine. During the day and night bacteria accumulates, skin cells turnover, sebum is produced, oils are gathered, and products (make-up, sunscreen, moisturizer, etc.) are applied. It's just like brushing your teeth. Twice a day and feel fresh.
* Exfoliate, but not too often. It can lead to redness but also allows you to remove the outer layer of skin to reveal the newer skin beneath. Maybe a couple times a week. Chemical is great but physical can be good too, every once in a while. Try Extra Virgin Olive Oil and White Sugar rubbed on your skin a couple times a month, for example. Works great for the rest of your body too.
* Avoid the sun. Other than sunlight basically being carcinogenic by UVA and UVB radiation mutating DNA and causing skin cancers and [premature aging](http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/06/04/trucker-damage-face_web_620x350.jpg) but its ""positive"" effect on acne is mostly an illusion. After getting a tan acne may be less visible but that's just because your skin was damaged and is darker so it's harder to see. The reason why I said mostly is because sometimes sunlight can legitimately help acne by killing acne-causing bacteria with UV rays. Can be a decent short-term solution though.
* Use a moisturizer if you're going to be hit by harsh winds. Also, use a sunscreen if you're going outside (UVA rays penetrate clouds and are present all-year round).
* I generally like to avoid expensive products. Most of acne is caused by something already mentioned and most fixes are free and those that aren't can be purchased cheaply. Shea butter, oils, vaseline, sugar, gentle cleansers, and other basic skin care products are cheap. Even if something expensive does work, do you really want to depend on that forever? Don't be swindled in to the artificial markup. All the ingredients used in most formulations are cheap and massively produced. Other than for cleansing, I like to use single ingredients for skin-care.
* If you don't feel like researching ingredients, look for labels that indicated gentleness. Prefer descriptions like non-comedogenic, gentle, fragance-free, and paraben-free. Just note that these aren't really regulated and the effectiveness of a product is based on its ingredients and their proportions.
* Almost forgot to mention hormones. Changes and fluctuations with hormones can affect your acne. Women on their period, beginning menopause, pregnancy or changing birth control can all have an effect on your skin. I never spent much time researching this because I'm male but my best advice is to be scientific. If you changed your hormonal birth control and acne appeared shortly after and you haven't had it in years then it's pretty obvious what happened. Experiment with different types of birth control if this happens.
* Avoid stress. It sound weird but stress can cause acne and other conditions. Acne can be mainly hormonal and stress can effect your androgen and cortisol levels which can lead to sebum production, for example. Try meditating, avoiding stressful situations, avoiding negatives emotions, and stay relaxed.
* When in the shower, wash your face last, or at least after washing your hair. If you cleanse your face and then shampoo, oils and debris from your hair is washed off and drips down all over your face and the rest of your body. Generally, I like to do a top-down approach when showering to avoid this issue, however minor it may be.
* Avoid large amounts of makeup and the use of many different products. A lot of women cover up their bad skin with makeup and in turn just make their skin worse with all the products clogging their pores. It's a vicious cycle. You'd be surprised how well a good moisturizer and proper skin care can replace blush, foundation, and other prettifying products.
* Visit /r/wicked_edge if you believe your acne to be partially caused by improper shaving techniques. Basically, use a sharp blade on warm, wet skin with a good lather and shave with the grain to avoid skin irritation. Also you save money in the long-term with cheaper blades. Be sure to use an unscented shaving soap that is non-irritating.
* Use one towel for drying your hair and one towel for drying your body. Keep them separated so you can keep the oils separated as well.
* Pat your skin dry instead of vigorously rubbing it dry. After your shower wipe all the dripping water off of you with your palms so not as much will be absorbed in to your towel so they stay cleaner for longer.
* Exercise daily but try to do it at a time before when you normally shower. For example, if you shower in the morning, exercise before-hand and shower right after. Exercise increases blood flow and nourishes skin cells and helps flush out cellular debris.
* Accutane, even with its myriad of potential side effects, is the best cure for acne available right now. It works by decreasing the size and output of sebaceous glands. It also makes sloughed off cells less sticky. It can cause dryness of the skin, lips, mouth, etc. It can also cause liver problems, depression, birth defects if taken during pregnancy, etc. Talk to a professional if nothing else works.
* If you've tried everything and even bit the bullet and tried Accutane for its entire course and still nothing you still have an option. Waiting. A lot of acne is hormonal and will eventually clear up on its own, eventually.

I've had cystic acne my entire life. I took acutane as a young adult and every other topical and internal acne medicine you can imagine, but my acne persisted even as an adult. I wash my face three times a day. But nothing helps at all. It's very embarrassing and emotionally difficult.

When the big derecho storm hit our area last month, I was without power for seven days. During that time, my acne cleared-up almost completely. I could not believe it and it caused me to suspect my diet played a large role in my acne.

Before the storm, I drank about two gallons of milk every week and ate a block of cheddar cheese too. I love the stuff. When the power went out, everything in my fridge spoiled so I had to throw it all out. Many days the temperature was close to 100 so the food spoiled quickly.

When the power came back on, I went out and bought groceries with milk and cheese as usual and I broke out again right away. I then began searching the web for anything about diet and acne and I found that milk/dairy has been suspected for causing acne for years, but it's taboo in America to mention this. Criticizing milk is like criticizing Mom, Baseball and Apple Pie. You just don't do that.

This Australian guy charts his acne break-outs as they increase while he eats dairy products. He gets completely clear when he stops, then starts eating dairy again to record his outbreaks. His spreadsheets linking his acne rate to his dairy consumption are amazing: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheClearSkinStudy

This guy is a dermatologist and he has lot's of research papers that demonstrate a link to the hormones found in milk to acne and other illnesses in humans: http://acnemilk.com/

This guy is a medical doctor who has seen lot's of medical conditions improve greatly (sometimes entirely) when patients stop consuming dairy products: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O-ehIkwGME

The hormones in pregnant cow milk are natural and cannot be removed. They are close to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone which is known to play a part in several conditions, including acne.

I just want to tell this story to others who may be suffering with acne. I accidentally cured myself and I hope that this information helps you!

Thanks Reddit.

1357200939.0,86,self.acne,15vo6r,I've found a possible (not the) cure for acne (mine). It's remarkably simple.,acnashmakney,98,12,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/15vo6r/ive_found_a_possible_not_the_cure_for_acne_mine/,"Long story short I'm an 18 year old senior in HS, I've tried many things over the years to get rid of my acne, so far (before I reveal my ""cure"") I've tried various natural and un-natural products, drinking lots of water, changing my diet, getting more exercise and guess what... even doing all that, it's all only partially helped, not enough to make a difference. 

This past summer break I had my worst case of acne so far, cystic redness and bumps that were excruciatingly painful, disgusting and basically like any other long term sufferer of acne drove my confidence in the pits (to me it felt like absolute zero). Anyhow, school started (senior year) and my acne-shit storm had still not gone away leaving me even more depressed as no one in school had acne as bad (that I could see it was pretty ridiculously bad). To top it off I was staying up really late often making my acne worse. 

Now I've preached in other threads and to my friends, (when I didn't have acne that bad in middle school), that sleep is a acne miracle cure-- and it sort of is. But your skin has to be in the process of healing. But just getting more sleep wasn't enough to make a serious difference to me, then I started doing something I'd heard about from a facial lady. Icing. Icing acne, as well as taking cold showers is super beneficial at lessening reddening and swelling. So after a week of doing that I found it made a nice difference, but it was STILL not enough. So then I had an epiphany, I tried to think back to the most recent time when I had had flawless skin and what my environment was like. Turns out my environment played a huge factor because the last time I had perfect skin was just before 8th grade during a summer vacation to a tropical beach in Mexico. The weather was extremely hot and I was sweating all the time but I was also swimming in the clear blue salt water every day I was there. I tended to swim in the afternoon when the sun was down so I didn't get sunburned.

Anyhow, after thinking about this I decided to try something to combat my acne...you guessed it, washing my face with salt water. And...it's cured my acne. Wuu....How? Well according to many online sources, sea salt water acts as a natural antiseptic and cleans and sterilizes wounds.......acne is a wound right? Yup, an open fucking gaping wound. Hmmm.... Anyhow after some experimenting I figured out the best way to apply salt water to my acne, via spray bottle. I use a small 4 oz. glass spray bottle that I sterilized in boiling water but it was my only option as every other spray bottle in my house had some form of cleaning agent in it (And it's hard to sterilize plastic bottles). A few things also, salt is drying so it's best to drink lots of water so your skin hydrates itself, if you want to see the best effects drink at least 20 oz. of water at least 8 times throughout the course of a day (not all at once) to hydrate yourself effectively. Spray as much as you want but suck in your lips and keep your eyes closed so you don't dry out your lips and burn your eyes. Furthermore, the saltwater does not heal your skin the way you might think, it doesn't just kill the acne, it actually exfoliates and sterilizes. This means that it will squeeze your pimples for you and you don't have to do anything other that spray. In the first day of use I noticed a few whiteheads being pulled up. But after washing off the salt with cold water much of the crap gets washed off. It gets better every day afterwards. It took just over a week to completely get rid of my acne but because I'm still new to the idea of having perfect skin (having not had it since I was 10) I still spray my skin at least once a week now (usually on weekends).

If you have anymore questions on my routine just ask away (I'm sure I've left out a few things but nothing too big), I intend to watch this thread for a while.

TL;DR: Salt water spray cured my acne

EDIT: I knew I'd forgotten something: Be sure to use only unrefined sea salt that has no additives in it       (use ONLY sea salt). I use coarse sea salt from Whole Foods but probably any will work, just be sure to NOT to use salt with magnesia, anti-caking agent, or E535 (Sodium ferrocyanide) in it. 

EDIT: If you want to increase the effectiveness of the salt water, you can try steaming under a blanket and then immediately spraying afterwards while your pores are open so the salt water can absorb best. However, be warned that steaming too often can really dry your skin and so can steaming for too long. Because my acne's more or less gone now I only once a week but I found a little into the second week of doing this that steaming for around 5 minutes, then spraying myself, then steaming for 5 more mins and spraying again and air drying (while drinking lots of water of course) helped immensely to speed my recovery.",,False,,t5_2qse3,1357431299.0,,,True,t3_15vo6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/15vo6r/ive_found_a_possible_not_the_cure_for_acne_mine/,

*disclaimer* Long time lurker, first time posting. Throwaway account for a few personal reasons. While I recognize different treatments work for different people, I believe that I found a fundamental cause of a very common, stubborn, and chronic form of acne, comedones, and inflammation. This is my story of discovery.

Twenty-four year old male having suffered from mild, to moderate, to severe acne on my face over ten years and have never had a clear complexion in all that time until now. I have a fair complexion, sensitive skin, and moderate food/airborne seasonal allergies. Years ago my initial breakouts began in the ""T-zone"" specifically blackheads on and surrounding my nose. The war-zone then expanded to whiteheads and blackheads on my brow, and a malicious mix of cystic acne and whiteheads on my cheeks and jawline. I also broke out behind my ears with large milia-like, hard, non-inflammatory nodules. I am a clean and hygienic person and use fresh towels, one for face only one for body, I wash my sheets and pillow-cases regularly, and do my best to avoid touching my face throughout the day. I was always baffled by my recurring problem and assumed others were misjudging my condition as a biproduct of sloth and uncleanliness. 

Years of dermatologist appointments racked up costly bills as well as exposure to extremely powerful medications that I naively took in good faith from a doctor. In truth, my dermatologist was a Rx pusher and his friendly demeanor his effective sales-tool of deception. After having poor results (red flaky skin) with Rx topicals such as benzoyl peroxide, differin, duac and clindamycin, I was routed toward using Rx pills such as Minocycline, Doxycycline, and Tetracycline in conjunction with the topicals. Every time I changed antibiotics my skin improved for a few weeks before rapidly deteriorating into scar-inducing cystic breakouts. 

In 2004 at my dermatologist's recommendation went on my first regimen of Accutane. I read the labels and warnings but was assured only a small percentage of patients ever experience these side-effects and that the drug was ""pretty much"" guaranteed to work. That half-hearted promise combined with the fact that every other treatment had failed led me to believe Accutane was to be my salvation. I've known people who truly benefitted from the drug but I want to share how it effected me. Within a few weeks my skin became dry and red, my scalp itchy, my joints ached, my eyes jaundiced and I experienced irregular sleep patterns as well as periods of manic depression. Did I tell anyone? No. Why? I was going to tough it out to FINALLY defeat my acne and the anxiety that came with it. I had regular blood work and was told everything checked out, that my side effects were normal. Anyway, after 5 months of soul-draining exposure to the drug, my skin was worse than before the treatment. The acne coverage was about the same, but my skin was thin and weak, hypersensitive, red, blotchy, and constantly dry.

 I went back to my usual regimen of a gentle wash and wallowed in self pity for over a year, never really improving, having ""o.k. days"" and ""terrible weeks"" before my dermatologist recommended a fourth course of antibiotics to prevent further scarring. They failed again. After that I entered my picking phase, where on some primal level I was determined to kill the condition myself if the medications couldnt. The subsequent scarring and lack of progress is still regrettable to this day. So I found myself sitting, slouched and defeated flipping through random magazines in the dermatologist's waiting rooms listening to the pages flip-over without reading a word, feeling broken. At that point I would have dunked my face in an acid bath and hid in a cave for a year if I could emerge blemish free but instead was misguided to a regimen far worse. A second round of Accutane. 

This time the dermatologist had concrete numbers for me, 80% success rate for second course users he said. Four months later I found myself standing on a second story balcony with a belt around my neck thinking about how my skin was still going to look pock-marked inflamed, and mangled during an open casket ceremony. I'm not a religious person, so instead of thanking God, I thank the cheap manufacturing process that caused the belt to snap at the buckle on the way down. It is also important to say that this was undoubtedly the most selfish thing I have ever done. I hit the ground and kneed myself in the jaw. Spitting blood I thought of all the people I would have heart and all the painful questions they'd be asking, likely to arrive at the wrong conclusion. A few months before I was a witty, engaged and humorous person, aware of my physical eyesores, upset by them, but not self-loathing by any means. Granted on my first course of Accutane I'd have moments where I felt really down but the magnitude of depression and the destructive, neurotic introspection I experienced during my second course led me to live a quiet secluded life of hermitage and hopelessness. 

I haven't told anyone I know about this struggle and the severity of my own actions and I thank this forum and its members for giving me the courage to discuss it and I implore others to seek out someone to talk to if they find themselves as wayward as I was. Also, be mindful of your peers and reach out to help others if you notice a change in someone's demeanor and habits, which may not be so sudden or apparent. I was really good at lying about how ""okay"" I was just to get people to stop asking questions and leave me alone. It's not an easy thing to trust someone with a personal strife and sometimes making the first contact can save a life. 

The battle continues...

After picking myself up off the ground, both metaphorically and literally, I decided I was done with prescription medications and stopped taking Accutane immediately. I then began a passionate pursuit of vitamins, minerals, and natural health supplements. I was convinced the problem was internal (where else could this pus, inflammation, and gunk be coming from) and also realized if my wounds and scars were going to heal efficiently I needed to create the ideal nutrient climate in my system. I started with a high protein, high-fiber, high anti-inflammatory/alkaline diet combined with tons of water (with lemon juice) and exercise and gradually moved towards supplementing with additional items. I also recognized that I broke out worse after taking long hot showers or eating certain foods the days before, specifically high-yeast and high-sugar content foods/beverage and cheeses. 

I started experimenting, altering every fews months to allow for effective courses with various regimens including Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, Vitamin D, Potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, Selenium, DMAE, Cod-Liver Oil, Probiotics, Biotin, and other B-Complexes. I want to note that it is very very important to hydrate diligently and refrain from excessive use of alcohol when taking a hefty supplement load as it can strain your liver and kidneys. I know in college it is difficult to refrain from alcohol altogether so drink A LOT of water throughout the day. Be sure to take the vitamins and supplements at the appropriate time of day and with water or with food as directed. Throwing down a heap of all of them at once is not advised as they react with each other. The result, my skin improved, my energy levels rose and my wounds healed more quickly but I was still experiencing breakouts, though less severe, and rarely anymore forthcoming cystic acne (some deep knots still slumbered under layers of tissue.) I also still had occasional flare-ups and they were almost always isolated to my cheeks, nose, brow, and behind my ears. 

I maintained that strategy for a few years but still would wake up every morning to at least one or two new whiteheads and a scattering of blackheads on my nose and brow, and incurred a few scars here and there that deceptively add up over time. Where was this gunk coming from? I knew that I was still missing something and my obsession with ""solving"" the problem led to unwarranted picking again of tiny comedones and milia which sometimes became inflamed and larger because of my prying. I also tried natural topicals such as tea tree oil, manuka oil,manuka honey, lavender oil, baking soda, castor packs and ice baths and though wound healing and recovery time was expedited, the underlying cause was still at work. 

Then in a collision of coincidences I made my discovery. It was a combination of reviewing a copy of my medical records which noted several ear infections as a child. While I was sick with a sinus infection I studied the anatomy of sinus passages and discovered chronic sinusitis is actually a yeast infection/candida overgrowth. This can be worsened by long term effects of exposure to antibiotics. Drumroll please....the literal and figurative underlying cause to my chronic acne was my sinuses!

I realized when looking at a diagram of sinus passages that the most prevalent breakout regions on my face were directly above/surrounding my sinuses. My cheeks, nose, brow, temples, behind my ears/neck. I found myself excitedly asking, could I have developed a resistant infection (possibly gram negative/yeast combo + allergy aggravated) in my sinuses that stubbornly resided at varying capacities depending on the strength of my immune system (i.e. flare ups during flu-season / better skin in summer when swimming in/accidentally inhaling ocean salt water) Was this my eureka moment?

I immediately went to the store and bought a ""Neil Med"" sinus rinse set (there are other kinds but this one gives you the ability to slightly pressurize the flow of the solution) which included the non-iodized salt and baking soda packets. Using filtered water I started the process. Much to my dismay I expelled heaps of dark green and brown sludge from deep within my sinus cavities over the next two days. Followed by three days of yellow goo. Followed by a mixed clear/yellow/chunky debris and then nothing but the cleaning solution itself. The result, I honestly felt blessed, like I had taken and extended bath in a Lazarus pit. Not only could I breathe better then ever (didnt really notice impaired breathing before due to the chronic nature of the problem) I could hear better, smell better, taste finer notes of foods, speak more clearly with deeper resonance, and slept like a hibernating bear. I combined that two time a day rinse regimen (three to start) with a Yeast-Fighters supplement. The supplement contains a Fiber Blend (psyllium husk, guar gum, apple pectin, chitosan) Lactobacilus Acidophilus, Garlic Bulb Extract, Herbal Extract Blend (pau d'arco bark, onion bulb, golden seal, echinacea, black walnut seed) and Caprylic Acid. 

Overall result of this ten year investigative and perilous journey has been a success. I can feel my skin beginning to normalize, breakouts have ceased (except for the slow rise of some ancient deposits) I no longer have inflammation and my oil production has returned to a proper functioning status. I continue with the sinus rinse occasionally and still take a vitamin regimen, lots of water, and exercise. When I do get an occasional pimple or exhumed residual cyst I take a warm shower, carefully extract the core (only when ready) then ice the area or run cold water over my face for a few minutes. I then pat dry and apply tea tree and lavender oils as a spot treatment.

As for the scarring of old, I have found another super-product. Rosehip seed oil. It is an extremely lightweight oil, thinner in viscosity than jojoba and a retinol, high in Vitamin A, C, E and essential fatty acids(linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic.) I use it for both overnight spot treatment mixed with lavender oil and as a moisturizer for dry patches as I find it to be non-comedogenic and readily absorbed by the skin. It has a pleasant and subtle woodsy aroma. I've noticed that the darker its tint the more effective it is. I usually apply a few drops to my fingers, pat onto slightly damp skin (better to ice/cool your face beforehand to increase effectiveness) allow to soak in for a few minutes then gently pat/blot the excess oil. I cannot express how grateful I am for this product and its effectiveness. As a retinoid, the oil can aggravate existing acne and should not be used over the entire face everyday. Remember, the healing will take time.

Well it appears my story here has come to an end, I hope this reaches and helps as many people as possible so spread the word! I wish I had solved this years ago but the journey of battling this affliction has made me a stronger and more understanding person, not judging others by their appearance nor assuming causalities. I would be glad to answer any question you might have whether they pertain to the content of this post or something unrelated. Thank you for your time and keeping this valuable supportive community alive.

Well, actually, I never used my own pee, because I'm a total germ-a-phobe, and I never took acutane. But I did see 7 different dermatologists, tried about 12 prescription creams, 2 different antibiotics, birth control, probably over 30 OTC creams, and a multitude of different supplements. 

Anyway, in late Novermber, I decided to try a new supplement plan. I took one capsule of Chromium Picolinate (get it at whole foods) and one capsule of MSM (also at whole foods) every night before bed. I had no bad side effects from these supplements. About 2 weeks after I started, my acne went away. I still seriously can't believe it. It's gone. Not only that, but I don't have to do anything else. I can sleep with my make-up multiple nights in a row and I won't break out. I can work out and not immediately take a shower and I won't break out.  Also, my scars are going away! It's a miracle!

Topical/prescription
------------------------

Benzoyl peroxide - didn't work

Clindamycin - actually worked for 1.5 years, skin got immune to it shortly after. This is a common problem of using clindamycin alone

Minocycline - Took it for 3 months - it slowed down my acne, but I had dilated pupils, and wasn't comfortable taking prolonged antibiotics, so I stopped.

Differin - worst medication I ever took - made skin plastic-y, and resulted in the development of Blepharitis in my eyes due to the dryness. I still deal with the blepharities today, more than 6 years later.

Benzamycin - effective, but stopped working within a year

--------
Natural
-----------

Weekly steam + mask - Doesn't make a difference

Eggs - Ditto

Honey - Ditto, though it does make your skin softer

Eating raw garlic - took it for a month or 2 - it doesn't do much, aside from make your breath stink. I'm sure its healthy in other ways though 
(it makes your blood thinner)

Zinc + other vitamins - Resulted in a severe breakout (worst of my life) when I decide to take about 3-4 different pill types all at once (zinc, b-complex, and two other things I can't remember).

Olive oil on face - Went through a phase of not using lotion, using olive oil to wash my face instead. This only made my skin softer - the pimples kept coming.

Not washing my face with a cleanser - Severe dryness after 2 weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------

What worked:
---------------------

Reducing sugar intake - This was my number one cause for acne.

Eating things that only a caveman could eat  - Better food = healthier you.

Changing bed sheets/pillow sheets weekly - Definitely helped.

Drinking lots of water - Definitely helps.

Exercising - Ditto.

Reducing stress, whatever the cause of your stress may be (for me, it was sleeping late) - Sleeping early = less acne for me.

Lemon juice - Put it on my scars in the winter, it clears them up within a week

Drinking lemon juice - did it in the mornings on an empty stomach....doesn't stop pimples, but it does make your skin glow

Putting any OTC medicine on problem spots while making sure I followed the rest of the above list.

-------------------------------------------

My recommendations: 

I realize that what worked for me won't work for everyone...but if you notice, the list of ""things that worked"" barely contains anything topical.

The one thing that I did which helped me narrow things down as to why I got pimples was to keep an Acne journal. Every day, I wrote down where my pimples were on my face, what I ate the day before, etc.

That way I could narrow down what triggered it for me. Ultimately, I realized that excessively eating sugar (for example, if I eat nutella everyday this week, I'll break out) was my main issue.

I've always been a firm believer that acne occurs due to fundamental internal problems...whether that is a vitamin deficiency or an inability to digest certain things. Its upto you to find out exactly what your body cannot tolerate. Unfortunately, this means a lot of trial and error. Tacking on topical after topical does not really do anything but hide the symptoms (unless you have severe acne and really need it).

---------------------------------------

TL;DR - Moderate-mild acne since 14. Got new pimples almost every day. Eventually figured out root cause for acne and took more natural preventative measures.

1350535594.0,51,self.acne,11oagh,How I became acne-free in six months by living healthier (and with a little help from apple cider vinegar),davisr,57,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/11oagh/how_i_became_acnefree_in_six_months_by_living/,"Only half a year ago, [my forehead was plastered with pimples.](http://i.imgur.com/z1jKh.png) Throughout high school (2007-2011), I lived happily with a pizza face. Some weeks were better than others, but none could be classified as *good*, or even *decent*, complexion. For the most part, I never let it affect me. To be quite honest, I never thought much of it; emotionally, it didn't hinder me. I was quite social, and nobody ever said anything.

Physically, though, it hurt quite a bit. Even though I never saw a dermatologist, it was quite clear that my acne was cystic: anyone with this type knows how painful a burst pimple can be. Although I tried getting rid of it through soaps, lotions and masks, nothing worked. If anything, those products aggravated my acne.

It's important to note that I've never been a healthy fellow. Always a finicky eater, my height was tall but weight low, giving me a slender structure. That's why, on my nineteenth birthday, I decided to better my lifestyle. My motivation wasn't to rid myself of acne (it didn't affect me much) but instead to become muscular, fit, and healthy.

Without further ado, I present my technique.

- **The weather turned warmer.** I'm from the northern midwest, where the winters go negative and the summers reach 100°F. I know this can't be controlled (without moving), but I feel as though my acne is less-severe in mid-July.

- **Exercise, exercise, exercise.** I've kept a strict schedule of riding my bike 24 miles every other day. On those days I don't bike, I lift weights for twenty minutes.

- **Keep a clean face.** Every few hours, when my face gets noticeably oily, I splash some water on it and gently pat it dry. A convenient time to do this is whenever my hands need to be washed.

- **Don't let your hair touch your face.** Between showers, my hair becomes greasy. To prevent my bangs from touching my forehead, I use forming cream to style it out of the way. Hair gel is wet and starchy, so I avoid it.

- **Ditch the pillow.** I stopped using a pillow completely. I just have a mattress with clean sheets, and a single blanket. With a pillow, I slept on my face. Now that I've gotten rid of it, my head rests on my arm, greatly reducing the surface area where my face is touched, or I sleep on my back.

- **Diet.** Before changing my lifestyle, I ate less than 1500 calories per day. Now, I eat more than 3000. Do I want to? No, but I stuff the food down my gullet anyway. My diet now is very high in nuts and fruits (trail mix is a favorite) with at least one undressed salad every day. For example, for breakfast I might eat a four-egg cheese omelet, toasted bagel with butter, peanut butter sandwich, banana, and glass of milk.

- **Take a multivitamin.** -- It's important not to miss any nutrients, even if you *think* you're eating enough food groups. I use One-A-Day Men's.

- **Cut the sugar, entirely.** I haven't had any candy since April (save for some black licorice once every couple months) and haven't touched a soda.

- **Drink plenty of water.** When biking, I drink a liter of Gatorade. When sitting, I always have a glass of water nearby to sip from.

- **Quit drinking alcohol.** Before, I partied often. I still party, but not as much and I've stopped drinking (except for a few occasions, after which some pimples appeared). When you get drunk and pee like a racehorse, your body becomes quite dehydrated. Not only does your body get a nasty hangover, but your skin also dries out.

- **Abstain from sex and masturbating.** I know, it sounds unrelated, but since I started ignoring my manly urges my facial hair is far more abundant and faster-growing. This could just be a coincidence with my age, but I felt it was worth mentioning. (Side-note: good luck keeping a girlfriend.) Amazingly, I feel sharper mentally, just like George Costanza in that one episode of Seinfeld.

After all these things, most of my acne disappeared. Still, a few pimples persisted, which leads me to my final point.

- Apply a 1:1 mixture of **apple cider vinegar** and water with a cotton ball. After my morning shower I moisten my face with this, and after brushing my teeth (before bed) I paint it on. It's a little pungent for five minutes, but it is so worth doing. This is the final punch I've used over the past few weeks to get a completely blemish-free face.

I still have mild scarring from all those years with acne, but I'm sure those will go away with time.

My acne was mostly a symptom to my bad habits. By changing the way I live my complexion has never been clearer, or my spirits livelier! Not to mention all the health benefits (short-term *and* long-term) that go along with living healthy.

Most of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and it’s certainly a great source of collective knowledge on many topics. But there’s one thing that I’ve noticed people here are not good at: acne. The best we’ve managed as a collective is ""put a clean towel on your pillow every night"". But acne is caused by different things for different people. Dirty skin is not likely to be the real cause, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know that pain, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, or lead to more problems. It's made especially hard because the Internet is filled with misinformation and ignorance about how to treat acne, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. 

I've tried to extract the useful information from all this, approaching the problem from various angles rather than recommending a specific product or regimen. Despite what people in almost every reddit acne thread keep telling you (and there has been a lot of awful advice in those threads), there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skincare and acne before you can understand how to treat yourself, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.

**The Basics**

First, [this](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/best-acne-fighting-products.aspx) gives a good summary of acne, its causes, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/) is worth reading through for more info, as well as user reviews of every product and treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information, but also a lot of unreliable advice and anecdotes. Remember, what works for someone else may not work for you, and sometimes people make mistakes when assessing their own results.

I suggest you read through those links, as they go into more detail than I'm going to. The gist of it is, benzoyl peroxide (BP) will kill acne, but not everyone can tolerate it, as it can be drying/irritating. Salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acid/BHA) is the best exfoliant, with AHAs as a possible alternative. Physical scrubs are less effective, as they don't exfoliate deep enough into the pore, and you also risk scrubbing the acne on your face, which should always be avoided. I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, but good BHA products are really hard to find, so I would recommend Paula's Choice. They have a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (toner/gel/lotion), so you can find the right fit for your skin type.

A lot of people are scared of these ingredients, but they're some of the only over-the-counter products that have clear evidence supporting their effectiveness against acne. They are generally safe, even if they don't work for everyone. It's true that benzoyl peroxide can be too strong and potentially bad for skin. (Personally, I'm not a fan of it, as I have sensitive skin.) But salicylic acid is actually an anti-inflammatory, and it's less harsh than washing your face with an abrasive scrub. It can and should be used all over your face, not as a spot treatment (spot treatments do little to stop acne). Salicylic acid addresses acne at its roots by preventing pores from becoming blocked or enlarged, restoring their normal function. It's extremely effective against blackheads and whiteheads. It also has several benefits for your skin's health and appearance, making it smoother and more even, while reducing the discolouration that is commonly left behind by acne. Again, though, some people cannot use it, including those who are allergic to aspirin or sensitive to salicylates. Be aware that BP and BHA both increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun, so make sure you use sunscreen afterwards. If you can't do that, don't use them. I'd start by trying just salicylic acid, once a day, at night only, but regardless, you should be using sunscreen during the day (covered below).

As an alternative, I like tea tree oil, which is functionally [comparable to benzoyl peroxide](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2145499). It's a bit weaker and takes longer to work, but doesn't have the side effects of BP. There aren't really any good tea tree products around, though (it's mainly used by ""natural"" brands that also use irritating ingredients), so actually trying to use it is frustrating. Your best bet may be to buy pure tea tree oil and dilute it to 5% (i.e. 1:19) in a carrier oil, such as jojoba. (Camellia oil is also great for your skin, but I'm not sure if it blocks pores.) This also doubles as a light moisturiser, so use it right after washing your face to retain the moisture in your skin. If you have oily skin, you really don't want to be using creams and lotions on it anyway, as they'll just leave it greasy and potentially clog pores. As a side note, tea tree oil is highly volatile and may lose effectiveness from exposure to light or air, so I suggest buying small quantities and storing it carefully.

Women: you're in the fortunate position of being able to use birth control pills, which actually do something about your hormones, the root cause of your acne. Being male, I'm stuck with my unlucky hormones, so I don't know much about this.

**Skin Care**

So, someone told you that Product X fixed all their problems, or you saw an ad, or it just caught your eye on a store shelf. The first thing you want to know is if the product's claims are true, or just marketing bullshit. Check its review on [Beautypedia](http://www.beautypedia.com/) first (I'd love to know about any other comprehensive professional review sites, but I don't think there are any). You can also do advanced searches based on your skin type and the type of product you're looking for, giving you a list of options to check out. Their ""best products"" lists are a good starting point, but it's worth looking at others as well. If the brand you're looking for isn't there (more likely if you're outside America), you can look up ingredients on [Cosmetics Cop](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/A.aspx), which summarises most known info and studies on skincare ingredients. [Personal Care Truth](http://personalcaretruth.com/) and [Cosmeticsinfo.org](http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/) complement this nicely if you want more in-depth scientific analysis, or just more information on something you're unsure of.

I cannot stress this enough, but MAKE SURE YOUR ACNE IS NOT BEING WORSENED BY ANY OF YOUR SKINCARE PRODUCTS. So many people start with minimal acne, but they respond to it with bad products, which block pores or irritate their skin, leading them into a cycle of worse and worse acne. And yes, anything can be doing this - it doesn't matter if it says ""non-comodegenic"" or ""hypoallergenic"" or ""natural"", because those terms are not regulated or strictly defined. They're basically marketing lingo made to convince you that you're getting something safe. While acne is related to hormones, many other things can exacerbate it by increasing sebum production. If you have sensitive skin, just about anything could be a culprit, especially cleansers. You can also save yourself a lot of time in checking new products by making sure they include none of the ingredients listed [here](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/skin-irritation-your-worst-enemy.aspx). These are less of a concern at the end of the ingredients list, though, as this implies a very small quantity.

Start by using as few products as possible, and slowly adding more to see how they affect your skin. At a minimum, you need a cleanser, and if you have dry areas of skin, a moisturiser. If you have oily or combination skin, you can use a toner (alcohol-free) as a very light moisturiser, as you ideally still want something to restore your skin's balance after washing off its natural oils. Remember, breakouts won't happen overnight, as acne can take weeks to form below the surface. This makes it very hard to actually identify whether something new is helping or hurting, so you may need to use something for a few weeks and see what happens. While a good product will take time to work, don't be fooled by claims of ""purging"". If you get *worse*, i.e. breaking out immediately from something new, stop using it.

For men, shaving products, aftershaves and razors can all be irritating. The trend of adding more and more blades has made this worse, which isn't helped by the fact that these blades encourage you to rush and to push too hard on the skin. Two blades will lead to fewer problems than five blades. Better yet, though, check out /r/wicked_edge and get yourself a double edge safety razor. This takes some getting used to (you pretty much have to relearn how to shave), but gives you much more precise control, and a smoother, gentler shave. It's also much cheaper. Just be wary of the fact that most shaving soaps/creams contain fragrance, menthol, or other irritants, and many do not list ingredients online. Evidently, many people who make shaving products either know shit all about actual skin care, or just don't particularly care about sensitive skin (for which fragrance-free products are a must). There are some good suggestions for things to try in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/ly4mo/are_there_any_good_fragrancefree_shaving_soaps/).

I suffered from moderate to severe cystic acne (as diagnosed by my dermatologist) for 6 years before I figured out what worked for me, and what I think will work for most people struggling with acne.

**Background, you can skip if you want.**

I saw a dermatologist two years ago, who prescribed me a sulfur based antibacterial face wash, Tazorac gel, an antibacterial lotion, and antibiotics. The prescribed products did wonders on my skin, and I was clear in 3 months. The problem? The cost of the four prescriptions were $350/month, even after insurance. I had to stop using the products, switched to a cheaper alternative like Proactiv, and my acne came back, just as bad as before. 

I went back to my dermatologist and told her I could no longer afford the prescriptions. She recommended I use Hibiclens to wash my face, but still use a retin a gel like Differin. I decided spending even $200/month on these products was ridiculous and was determined to find a cheaper alternative.

**What causes acne?**

In short, dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria. The reason I responded so well to my prescriptions was because the face wash, lotion, and antibiotics got rid of the bacteria on my face, while the retin a gel speeded up skin cell production and cleared dead skin cells clogging my pores. I had oily skin, which was solved because the products sort of ""dried out"" my skin, but really they were just making my skin normal.

**I've tried this and that, but it didn't work.**

It is critical that you tackle all *three* causes--dead skin cells, oil, *and* bacteria. If you've tried something like Proactiv, and it didn't work, you probably have cystic acne (acne under the surface of your skin) which is caused *mainly* by bacteria. The main acne fighting ingredient in most over the counter treatments is benzoyl peroxide, which is not a *good* antibacterial ingredient. So while you speed up skin cell production, you're still left with oil and bacteria on your face! If you respond positively to Proactiv, which many do, you probably have very mild surface acne and normal to good skin, in terms of oil production and bacteria. This is a huge market for companies like Proactiv to cater toward, which is why most complete ""systems"" on the market won't work if you have moderate to severe acne.

**What works.**

I recommend three products, and only three products.

* Problem? Bacteria. Solution? [Hibiclens.](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Hibiclens-Liquid?skuId=102994) - $10.79

This antibacterial wash is commonly used in hospitals and doctors offices, so you're probably familiar with it. You can buy it in 8oz bottles on the shelf, or ask someone working at the pharmacy to buy a bigger bottle for about the same price with a foaming dispenser. If you choose to buy it in the bottle, I recommend putting it in a foaming dispenser regardless, to get the most out of the product.

Just spread one or two pumps of it very gently on your face. It will start to get a little tacky, which helps clear dirt and oil. After *two minutes*--enough time to kill all bacteria on your face--rinse it off with cool water and pat dry your face. The Hibiclens will continue to work for hours.

* Problem? Dead skin cells. Solution? [Benzoyl Peroxide.](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm) - $16.52

Benzoyl peroxide will clear away dead skin cells, and generate new ones more quickly, plain and simple. You might have initial redness, but your skin will get used to it. It's good to ease into it before using a lot, to reduce irritation.

I recommend this product because of the incredibly low cost. It's part of the [acne.org](http://www.ance.org/) regimen, which is a great regimen for people with mild acne. It doesn't help with bacteria or oil production though. They have a helpful, also creepy, video on how to use this product, shown [here.](http://youtu.be/7ZHy-W6xcec?t=2m57s) Just watch on the ""Step 2"" portion. It will start there for you.

Note: If you want a product you can pick up at the drug store as opposed to ordering online, you can buy something like [this](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/CVS-Acne-Treatment-Gel?skuId=428504), but it's not ideal. The bottle is tiny and very expensive. Also, the solution is 10% benzoyl peroxide as opposed to 2.5%, which can cause irritation. (Both 10% and 2.5% are proven to be just as effective. There is no benefit to using 10%.) It can be a good spot treatment though. 

* Problem? Oily skin. Solution? [Cetaphil Oil Control Moisturizer.](http://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-oil-control-moisturizer-spf-30-4-oz/-/A-14043848) - $12.75

It's important that you don't skip moisturizer, even if you have oily or combination skin. Dry skin can cause irritation, which can also cause acne. This moisturizer does a good job at keeping your skin matte throughout the day. It works for me and I have really oily skin. The SPF 30 is great for reducing redness from the sun, and even in flash photography pictures. :)

**In summary...**

The combination of these three products cleared my skin in one month without a single breakout. I no longer have to spend hundreds of dollars of prescriptions, and avoid the harmful side effects of drugs such as Accutane.

While acne varies from case to case and response to these products will differ, I'm confident that these products will work *better*, if not *perfectly* for those of us who have tried everything.

**TL;DR**

Everyone's different. Maybe it is that bad to them. It doesn't make me feel better because usually people say that to make you feel better. I just hate when people say that.

* ""Maybe you don't wash your face enough.""

JUST NO. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I DO. BE QUIET.

* ""It'll go away on it's own.""

I've had acne for 7 or so years now. Yeah, it hasn't gone away yet. I know some people here have had it for way longer. Saying this doesn't help at all.

* ""Change your pillow case. It works!""

This is MIGHT work for REALLY REALLY mild acne. MIGHT. Everyone is different. One treatment might work fantastic for some, and cause a breakout for others.

* ""You don't eat right.""

In general, it usually really annoys me when people, who have no idea what I do, or have done, to try and 'cure' my acne tell me stuff like this. Maybe I'm a fricking vegan for all you know. Maybe healthy food causes my acne (it doesn't) 

* ""I bet [blank] causes your acne""

It's okay if someone is trying to be helpful, but if someone is being condescending, it's not okay.  (ex. as I'm putting a greasy burger in my mouth) I'm aware certain things contribute to SOME peoples' acne, but everyone is different. Just let me enjoy my food and not feel guilty. 


Okay, I'm done ranting. I try not to let people get to me, but sometimes...damn. Y'know? If I missed any, let me know! **What do people say to you about acne?**

-Spray bottle
-unrefined coarse sea salt 
-boiling water
 
I just pour salt into the hot water after its been boiled and stir it in. i never use a set ratio, but i use quite a bit of salt. You can tell when the salt is having a harder time dissolving. 

Lightly spray the affected areas and let sit till it dries (this will sting/burn for the first few times). leave it on for 2ish hours and then rinse face and reapply. 

Thought i should add: I also shower daily, use a cetephil cleanser during the shower and sleep on a clean towel every night. 

Dryness-  This WILL leave dry/salty/flaky skin. However. since i started using this a week ago, I've noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of flakiness i get. I only moisturized before i went out of my house or right after the shower. just splashing your face with water should get rid of the dryness. 

I now use this before bed every night and my once acne-ridden face is now rid of acne. Give it a try!

I had acne in high school, and then started breaking out again last August (I am 24).  It may be hard to tell from the pics but around the chin and cheeks I was getting hard cistic acne.  Some of it was so deep it wouldn't even reach the surface.  I also had it on my back and butt. I tried diet (no dairy, bread, or sugar), but that was not working. I saw a dermatologist in October, and started taking medication in the beginning of November. The first picture was from Jan 9th, 2013.  Not when my acne was the worst but still pretty bad.

I started with doxycycline 50mg twice daily. As well as Tretinoin cream .05%.   That really didn't do much for me.  They then bumped me up to 100mg Doxy twice daily, and gave me clindamycin and benzol peroxide 1.2%/5% (I think that really helped prevent new breakouts).

By April 1st most of my breakouts had gone away.  I also started birth control, and my derm bumped me up to tretinoin .1% to get rid of some of the left over scarring.  

I also started using ponds wet cleansing towlettes to remove makeup, and cetaphil for moisturizing during the day. My advice would be to be patient and dilligent.  Work with your doctor and find what works for you.  My derm said my acne was severe enough I could have gone the acutane route, but I really didn't want to put my body through that.

1361419392.0,27,self.acne,18xmhi,28F finally figured out what was causing my acne and resolved it! ,juliam526,32,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/18xmhi/28f_finally_figured_out_what_was_causing_my_acne/,"Short back story: I am 28 years old, and in my teenage years, acne was not a problem. I had a few pimples here and there, but I never had to deal with horrible acne. When I was 21 I noticed I started getting a few pimples and with time they just got worse and worse. At 28, I have (had, until recently) HORRIBLE acne... no cystic thankfully (OMG my heart goes out to anyone with cystic acne) but it just never went away and got worse and worse as I aged. 

Anyone who is my age and has acne knows how horribly embarrassing it is. I know acne is embarrassing at any age, but when your an adult and you have to go to work or job interviews or whatever, and everyone else around you has clear skin, it's freaking horrible. I felt so ugly all the time because of it and sometimes didn't want to leave the house or look at people. 

I tried everything and nothing worked. And I tried them for months to let them work. So I've spent the last several years reading and reading and reading and I learned a lot of things about skin. 

First off, I think I did some serious damage to my skin by putting all that crap on my face. It's made for teenagers with really oily skin and looking back, I never had oily skin. Oil is good for your skin - your skin makes its own oil, and when you strip it away with harsh chemicals, your skin overcompensates by producing extra. 

The first thing I did was the ""caveman regimen"". Basically, you do nothing, in the hopes that your skin will heal itself and reset basically. For three months, I didn't touch my face at all. (More on that here http://www.thelovevitamin.com/3135/caveman-regimen/ ) 

Did it work? Not completely. BUT I did notice that the pimples I had would go away much faster and they weren't as red and aggravated. This lead me to believe I was on the right path. But my skin was really dry and flaking and I felt like I needed to exfoliate badly. 

So I switched to the Oil Cleansing Method. (More on that here:http://www.theoilcleansingmethod.com/ ) I know putting oil on your face sounds scary, but seriously... it is awesome. The idea is basic chemistry - like dissolves like, so the oil you add dissolves the excess bad oil. And oh man, my skin is so soft and healthy looking.

But wait, there's more! I figured out that my acne was being caused by hormones. Since it didn't appear to be a bacteria or cleansing issue, this was the conclusion I came to. I made the decision to try birth control and it worked pretty much instantly. It has to be the right kind for acne (google for more information on which one, some birth control pills make acne worse) I take Sprintec which is 9 dollars at Target Pharmacy. I've only been taking the pills for about a month and my face is pretty amazingly clear. I've never been so happy in my life. 

But that's not all... I have no desire to take birth control pills for the rest of my life or for any real length of time, so I kept reading. I have learned that hormone imbalance's can be caused by digestive issues and that for some of us, eating the right kind of foods is what causes that. It's completely fixable, though it's a lot of work, but for me at least, it's 100% worth it. If you are interested in learning more about how to fix your hormonal acne through digestion, I HIGHLY recommend this book: http://purelyprimalskincare.com/?hop=grooveit

I have no money to be made in this, but there is some SERIOUSLY amazing information in this book about digestion and how it effects your skin and hormones. I bought it, not really sure what to expect, but I would've paid double for it, it's a huge book with a LOT of information in it. 

Changing your way of eating is NOT easy, it takes a lot of effort and practice (eating NOTHING packaged is fucking hard in America) but if you're like me and you've tried everything, it's worth it. Every time I think about candy or cheese or whatever, I just remember how bad I feel when I have bad acne. Plus you get the added bonus of losing weight in a healthy way too! My plan is to wean myself off the birth control pills once I have been eating well enough that I believe I have fixed my hormones on my own. 

So right now I do the OCM every day, and take the birth control pills, and eat really extremely healthy - only real foods, no sugar at all. My acne is virtually cured, seriously, after one month. After a few months, I'm going start taking only half a pill every day to wean myself off and then hopefully, all my problems should be solved. 

Again, this is not for everyone, but if you are an adult, and you've fought with acne for years, and you've tried everything, and you just don't know what to do anymore, I SERIOUSLY can't recommend this enough! Hope it helps someone. 

Edit: I thought I'd throw this article up here, because this is what caused me to start looking into hormonal acne. You can get your hormone levels tested to see if it's an issue for you: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/adult-acne-in-women-can-signal-hormone-problems_n_2198763.html

My comment on there has been lost among the thousands of others but that lead me here.  I wanted to post how I cured my acne because I found out about it through word of mouth and I hope I can help someone else in the same way.  

Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) in high doses available from most health stores. If you search Google there's loads of discussion about it.  There's a scientific study where they talk about coenzyme-a but it basically boils down to B5 being the solution.

I had the worst acne imaginable from the age of 16 onwards. I was on antibiotics for 3 years until they were no longer effective and then when I came off them I had the worst break-out I've ever had.  That's when I found out about B5 from someone I met who saw how bad my skin was.  It took about 6 months to completely clear up but all I was doing was taking a vitamin that I'm guessing I was deficient in.  It seems to good to be true but it genuinely worked for me.  

The way I understand it is that your body needs Pantothenic Acid (vitamin B5) to produce hormones and enzymes. If your diet is short of B5 or your body isn't good at synthesising it then your body cannot produce enough enzymes to break down the oils that otherwise end up on your face resulting in acne.

I understand this as being why teenagers usually get acne. Their bodies are producing tonnes of hormones which use up the B5 leaving your body short of it for the enzymes.

I was taking 5g a day (10 x 500mg tablets). This has a delayed reaction of 1-2 months so you have to be patient. Drink tonnes of water with it and take a biotin tablet a day too as I found this helped.

Once my skin was clear I slowly dropped the dose down over the years to 500mg a day which is what I take now and my skin is clear.

Smoking and drinking reduces the effect of the B5 so are best avoided.  Eating less fat obviously helps too because there's less oil to end up on your face.

Any questions about it are welcome.  I'd love to hear someone find this as their solution.  Accutane and antibiotics are so bad for your body.  The only side effect I had from B5 was extremely sensitive teeth.

EDIT:  That scientific study I mentioned is on the Wikipedia page for Pantothenic Acid: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantothenic_acid#Acne

Large cyst like deep pimples would well up all around my mouth, lower cheeks and forehead. At first I thought I was just being lazy washing my face but even after regularly cleaning my cell phone with lysol, changing my pillow cases a few times a week and not wearing makeup it persisted and came to accept that it was acne. I did a my research, especially on chinese and aruvedic systems and decided to cut out spicy foods and eggs from my diet and made a face mask out of turmeric and ghee. Well, that helped a little bit and the turmeric mask pulled a lot of the pimples to the surface including the content of one bump that had been there for many months. I began to use salycidic acid pads for maintenance. But all this really wasn't stopping those deep cysts from forming. This wasn't a cure, just management.

Anyway, I never mentioned this to the doctor because I wasn't quite ready yet to go into it medically. I was just having a yearly physical check up and among a myriad of items my doctors tested my blood for vitamin D deficiency. Everything else was normal and healthy but my D levels were 26 when it is supposed to be 60. I was prescribed four 50,000 unit pills to take over the course of four weeks and a daily supplement of 2,000 units. 

Almost immediately I noticed a change in my skin and facial oils. After two weeks the deep zits have stopped forming, and the existing scars and dark sore spots have healed. My skin is not perfect, but the ACNE is gone. I am overjoyed!!! But then I thought back to all the research I did to try and get rid of the acne and do not remember any talk about vitamin D. So my question to you all is if anyone here has tried this, and I don't mean just taking OTC supplements, I mean if you have had tested positive for and treated a confirmed deficiency with prescription based mega dose of the vitamin and the acne either did or did not go away. If it didn't then I don't want to be too confident in my observation, but it makes sense, because the skin is directly related to synthesis of vitamin D. In my case I fully believe the acne must have been a symptom of my vitamin D deficiency and unless someone with acne treats it they don't really make the link. I haven't been to the Doc yet for follow up and not sure what he thinks or knows about it.

1. when i feel this, i press some of my saltwater mixture to it via cotton ball or cotton swab for about 1 minute. (my salt water mixture is what i use for my whole face, which consists of unrefined sea-salt mixed into boiling water. ) 

2. Repeat step 1.

I am aware that some skeptics might say that i am simply pushing the cyst deeper into the skin, but i have been doing this for months now and have never had a reacurring cyst. the salt water and tea tree oil dries out the cyst efficiently, and the cortizone cream works its magic. this has had a 100% success rate and has saved my ass many times.

I was washing every day with every regimen and combination of medicines available.  I didn't go acutaine because my best friend had a bad reaction. 

I'm trying to keep this short and sweet, but I had a pretty good feeling that my acne was due to hormones.  (BC did nothing to help)

did some research and came across the pantothenic acid and L-cartinine combination.  From what I read, for pantothenic acid to work against acne you needed 10 grams a day. and people on 10 grams a day were experiencing hair loss.  which I wasn't too interested in.
However, if combined with L-Cartinine, the dose could be kept at a lower level and still be effective.  Without the hair loss.

I figured, why not give it a try.
For a month now I've been taking 500 mg of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) along with 250 mg of L-cartinine 3 times a day.  (found them at Drug emporium for pretty reasonable price) 
I experienced a little bit of dry skin at first, but a simple moisturizer has fixed it.  (I've never actually been able to use a moisturizer on my face before, and it's wonderful to be able to do that now!!!) 

when I started taking vitamin b5 and L-cartinine I had 3 large cysts on my face that i was struggling desperately to leave alone. They had been on my face for about 2 weeks already.  After two days I noticed that the cysts were smaller, but I chalked it up to wishful thinking.  On the third day I noticed a 4th cyst forming on the base of my chin. I thought...well f**k I can't win.  by the end of the 3rd day, all 4 cysts were gone.

since I've started this, I haven't had another cyst.  (Normally I would have at least 2 by now) And all other acne is gone.  REPEAT! all acne is gone!

This is the first time since before I was 13 that I'm actually seeing my face for what it is, and not like a depressing mask.  

I dont know that this will work for everyone, but if you think your acne could be caused by hormones, give this a try.

500 mg of pantothenic acid and 250 mg of L-cartinine 3x a day.

I've dropped down to 2x a day now that my face is clear and I still haven't seen any pimples.

(Girl in mid-twenties)",sitalita,27,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/16phy0/my_acne_is_finally_gone_wanted_to_share_what_got/,"I'm a girl in my mid-twenties, and I can say without a doubt that for me, my breakouts were fairly hormonal. They were BAD, like cystic acne all over. The catalyst for better skin was birth control; specifically Yasmin (or Ocella). That's what flat out got rid of my acne. However, I'm not on it anymore and still don't get acne. That's because I'm finally being nice to my skin. I'm not punishing it with harsh scrubs and highly concentrated washes. It's pretty much the opposite of what I thought would get rid of my acne.

I've found that the mildest, gentlest washes are JUST as effective as strong acne washes. And that's a much better thing to get your skin used to; it doesn't have to overproduce oil to make up for how dry it gets. So my first suggestion is to ween yourself onto a gentle wash (slowly, every other night, until your skin gets used to it). I like unscented Purpose and Cetaphil but the generics of those are just as good. I also use a scrub maybe three times a week. St. Ives Apricot Scrub and Aveeno brightening scrub are both good options.

Secondly, I am using a freakin' RICH face cream. I can't believe it's not causing acne for my oily skin, but my skin seems to love it. It is looking better than ever and the scars are fading. It looks almost the same with or without foundation. I love Estee Lauder's Time Zone cream which comes in the purple container. I also like Olay's Regenerist cream which comes in the red bottle. These lotions are very rich but (this is just my speculation) since my skin is getting plenty of moisture, it doesn't try to overproduce oil. By the way... I'm pretty sure some foundations are pretty bad for when you're trying to clear things up, so I try to use the lightest one I can. I really like Estee Lauder's doublewear since I think it looks the most ""natural"" or like it's not there.

Third is just common sense stuff-- try to drink lots of water. Don't sleep with your face on dirty pillows if you can help it. Don't touch yo face. And eat healthy foods! :) When I eat poorly for two days, I feel a pimple coming... But when I insert salads and carrot juice into my daily routine, it really gives my skin a glow. 

Fourth, I know this stuff doesn't work right away... it's more of a maintenance routine once you get the ball rolling. So I think, out of the many, many things I tried while battling the acne, I love the effects of sulfur. Sulfur works to get rid of acne. If you live by a hot springs, do take advantage of that. And I really liked Carley's Clear and Smooth acne wash. Proactiv was just ok, it worked for a while and stopped working. 

So I really hope this post helps someone! I put my very favorite, and somewhat surprising (to me), solutions.

Well now I suffer from acne scars and have tried LOTS of different things.
•Lemons
•Vinegar
•Olive oil-steam-scrub procedure
•40% glycolic peel (I did at home)
Etc..

None of which worked. Luckily I read an article on MSM cream (you've probably seen it before but that's not all you use so keep reading). 
MSM cream helps restore the collagen in your skin (your acne scars). Now alone, it's made very light, almost unnoticeable improvement.

Then I came across this miracle tool called a dermaroller. It's basically a bunch of needles on a small hand-held tool that you roll on your face. 

Using both the dermaroller and MSM cream has made a visible difference in a week.


Here's what you need:
MSM cream
Dermaroller (Size: 1.5)

Every morning wash your face. Apply MSM cream and topical cream (if you use one)

Every night wash your face. Use dermaroller all over your face, then apply MSM cream and your topical cream.

It's cheap and very effective. If you suffer from scarring, I highly suggest this. It worked wonders for me.

I looked in the mirror and didnt see me...... its really hard to write this. I didnt see me what looked back at me didnt look happy its not that I have active acne on my face but its that I have ice pick scars all over my forehead and nose and I have really bad hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks and other areas. I feel like the ugliest person in the world right now my skin looks really bad and I dont know what to do about it.

Ive been to a dermatologist before I had Isolaz done to my face and that got rid of all the big white heads that are on my face but I really want to get a face peel done and also the derma roller but they are really really expensive. I have no clue of what to do. I have a really low self esteem because of the whole acne and scarring thing. I just want to be happy but I cant i want to be confident but I know that people will judge me for the scars that I have on my face and stuff. I dont like having acne why couldnt i be born without it, be one of those people that have 100% clear skin. 

This is gonna sound really stupid of me but I really want to become a male model but with this scarring and crap on my face the dream just looks like a fantasy to me now. I have brown skin so all the pigmentation is a dark brown all over my face.

I mean I do all the right stuff I dont eat junk food ever I havent had soda in YEARS and I drink ALOT of water throughout the day. I also have a good skin care regime where its not too harsh and not too subtle. I think I may be a little depressed or this may just be a bad day for me, a day where Im not feeling too great. I dont know. 

Im really sorry for rambling on for so long.

Although people often refer to such marks as acne scars, they are really post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation marks, which appear as your body heals. Luckily, such marks are not really scars at all, and it is rare for them to be associated with permanently damaged skin. That means there are steps you can take to speed up their healing and return to clear, even-toned skin! **

#1: Use only well-formulated, gentle skin-care products. It's tempting to try abrasive scrubs and all manner of irritating treatments in a desperate effort to get rid of acne discolorations, but irritation only causes more harm, which impedes your skin's ability to heal itself. Scrubs tear into the skin, delaying healing, and products with irritating ingredients also impede healing. Stick to the products we've reviewed and recommended on Beautypedia (or look up ingredients in our research-based Ingredient Dictionary). Of course, all Paula's Choice products are formulated to be gentle and they are all free of irritants.

#2: Use an AHA or BHA exfoliant daily. The benefits of a well-formulated AHA or BHA, especially BHA, can be truly impressive. A BHA (beta hydroxy acid, active ingredient salicylic acid) used daily not only exfoliates the surface of the skin but also penetrates oil so it can reach inside the pore, dissolving the clogs that lead to breakouts. BHA is also a potent anti-inflammatory that reduces redness. Thus, in one step, you reduce the likelihood of developing a breakout and you speed the fading of the post-acne marks you have now.

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs, like glycolic acid) works on the surface of the skin, which absolutely can help fade discolorations, just like a BHA. However, AHAs cannot penetrate oil and exfoliate inside the pore like BHA, so they are not as adept at treating breakouts or clogged pores.

#3: Use a broad-spectrum SPF 15+ product every day, without exception. Unprotected exposure to UV light (which will get to your skin whether it's sunny or cloudy) hurts your skin's ability to heal, which means the red marks from acne will stick around longer. UV exposure damages skin cells (even if you aren't ""tanning"" or sunburned), making healing slower and less efficient. Protecting your skin from UV exposure every day is critical to fading discolorations, plus it keeps your skin healthier-looking longer!

Paula's Choice has several excellent SPF-rated daytime moisturizers for any skin type! For the face, Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Daily Mattifying Lotion SPF 15 is a great choice, as is SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50.

Looking for an all-over formula for face and body? Try Paula's Choice Extra Care Non-Greasy Sunscreen SPF 50+ or Peter Thomas Roth's Uber-Dry Sunscreen Cream SPF 30.

You also can consider combining a foundation or tinted moisturizer rated SPF 15+, and a pressed powder with SPF 15+ as your sunscreen! That can be a great option.

#4: Use products loaded with antioxidants and cell-communicating ingredients. Those two categories of beneficial ingredients—antioxidants and cell-communicating ingredients—help defend your skin from further damage, while also ""communicating"" with your cells to help them speed up their ability to repair damage. The result is reduced inflammation and a shorter healing time for your discolorations. Using a toner, serum, and/or moisturizer formulated with a variety of these ingredients (and in stable packaging; that is, no jars or clear containers) is the best way to get their skin-repairing benefits.

Some types of cell-communicating ingredients, such as niacinamide and retinol, are particularly beneficial in the fight to fade your post-acne annoyances. Two targeted Paula's Choice products to consider are RESIST Anti-Aging Clear Skin Hydrator and the super charged RESIST Intensive Wrinkle-Repair Retinol Serum. Each is loaded with those cell-communicating powerhouse ingredients, in addition to other complexion improvers like vitamins C and E!

#5: Consider professional help. Research shows that post-inflammatory pigmentation—red or brown discolorations where a breakout once was—responds well to a series of Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatments. So, if you're desperate, have an imminent social event, and need the discolorations gone sooner than a skin-care routine can accomplish, IPL treatments may be your solution (for those with deeper skin tones, speak with your dermatologist about alternatives laser options to the IPL.) Another option is prescription tretinoin, (Retin-A, Renova), as is a monthly BHA or AHA peel performed by a cosmetic dermatologist.

For true acne scars (the pitted, indented kind), treatment options aren't as easy. Due to the extensive damage to and loss of collagen, no skin-care product can reverse their appearance. Dermal fillers can plump up the indentations, and you can combine dermal fillers with AHA or BHA peels or a series of fractional laser treatments for best results.

Microdermabrasion also is an option, but has much greater risks of damage to skin than laser treatments or higher-strength AHA or BHA peels, and the results aren't as impressive.",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_1b70lm,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1b70lm/tips_for_getting_rid_of_red_marks/,

I'm 21/F but have had pretty obnoxious acne since age 11. I've finally stopped breaking out, and haven't had even one new pimple in almost two weeks (record). 

I'm sure it goes without saying that over the past ten years I've used EVERY prescription and otc drug, wash, scrub, and cream available. Except Accutane. Can't believe that this is finally what worked...

So here are the major changes I've made in the last few months that may have helped:

- I don't eat wheat or highly processed foods. I tried cutting out dairy for a couple of months, but this didn't alleviate my acne or have any other positive health effect, so I started having dairy again (essentially just cheddar cheese and grass fed butter).

- I wash with Johnson &amp; Johnson Purpose face wash. I do this 2-3 times a day.

- After I wash my face, I moisturize with Derma E tea tree &amp; E antiseptic creme (it's amazing, less than ten bucks on Amazon). Can be used under make-up.

- I stopped touching my face almost entirely. I used to scratch and pick a lot. This was a very hard habit to break but damn it was helpful.

- Also for the past two weeks I've been doing the raw honey treatment for twenty minutes a day. It's messy and sticky but seems to make my skin very soft and I haven't had a pimple since I started doing it.

- Drinking TONS of water. 2-4L a day.

Acne seems to have completely subsided, after ten miserable years. Next, I can tackle my scarring. :) hope this helps someone!

So I wanted to share with you guys my lovely ongoing acne journey.  If this helps even one person then I'll be happy.  There's a lot of text, gl hf.  (Pics at end) 

**BEFORE situation**

I'm 22 and all throughout college (and HS) my face was always flaring up.  Up until this past spring, it was mostly manageable.. I had gotten used to going to work, parties, and other public places with 1 or 2 big ass bumps (and a handful of smaller spots + uneven colored skin) on my face.  I'd have one or two large spots and try to ""kill"" the spots with things like BP, Salicylic Acid, different aspirin and lemon masks etc (you know the drill).  These bumps would get less noticeable in 2 or 3 days but by then those smaller bumps have caught up --&gt; rinse, repeat.  Then this past spring (late feb/ early march), my face decided to wage an all out war.  So this post is tell you guys how I got these bumps (mostly) under control

**BEFORE DIET**

Also I'm a fairly healthy and active person.  During the school year and most of my summers, I would get at least 3 or 4 hours of exercise a week (weights + card).  My diet (I THOUGHT) was very good.  Never drank soda, never ate fried foods.  Probably one visit to Taco Bell a month (fresco menu) and a few chips and stuff like that once in a while if friends offered.  I never went out of my way to buy junk food.  A typical day would be something like:

* Morning: 4 egg whites + 1 yolk / cup of OATMEAL / apple or banana.  Or Fiber One CEREAL w/ milk.
* Snack: Some kind of cliffbar/luna bar with protein and CARBS
* Lunch: 2 chicken breasts /  brown RICE or whole grain SPAGHETTI / some veggies (broccoli, carrots, etc) OR * Sandwich on wheat BREAD
* Snack: Greek Yogurt w/ blueberries
* Dinner: PASTA / Chicken or beef or Salmon / WHEAT ROLL or other BREAD products / Salad

If funds were low, I would eat a ton of PASTA for the week.  Also being Asian, I occasionally eat stuff like those scallion pancakes, wontons, or dumplings (read: CARBS)

**BEFORE REGIMEN**

* Neutrogena Facial Wash during shower
* BHA Toner afterwards
* Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion &amp; Drying Cream for underground pimples/bumps
* Multi Vitamins
* Fish Oil
* Zinc

So.. fast forward to Mid/Late March.  Breakouts were still consistent except there were just more bumps and more redness now.  I was also getting more and more spots on my JAWLINE, above my lips (philtrum area) and in my CHIN area.  Crazy.  I still stubbornly thought that these OTC products would work and kept using random ""acne"" products, never thought to change my diet or anything like that.  Plus I had finals, commencement, and the release of Diablo 3 on my mind so I didn't really do anything about my skin.  It was bad, but at the time I was too preoccupied to care too much.  

It was only until late July (like around 7/20) that I did some thinking.  I figured that all these products never fix the ROOT CAUSE of acne.. they got rid of the 2 or 3 big pimples on the surface but the stuff is still growing underneath.  (plus if you think about it, if these products worked then the ""Acne industry"" would lose billions of dollars from people like us cause we wouldn't need to buy more products).  Also two years ago I had taken some Doxycycline.  That worked for the 5 or 6 months while I was on it but afterwards the acne came back so I decided I wouldn't use antibiotics.  

I kept reading that acne and diet were related and I was sort of skeptical.  Then I realized that 1) cancer is mostly a man-made 21st century disease (the prevalence was very low in ancient times), and 2) if you eat shit foods, you get fat // if you eat too much sugar your teeth will rot // if you eat protein after a workout, you're muscles will grow.  FOOD is related to our BODY.  Imagine that.  

So I took a long look at my daily intake of foods and I realized I ate a lot of carbs.  To do a little test I went on a 3 day water fast on like 7/20.  During these 3 days I noticed that there weren't really any NEW blemishes on my face.  It was just the old ones that were there and some were healing.  and afterwards my diet was ONLY whole grain spaghetti and crackers / wheat thins and water to drink.  Boom. new blemishes immediately.  (my 7/28/12 pic is from the Saturday after I ate carbs for a whole week).  Note they weren't even bad carbs (no cookies, ice cream, white bread).  Even the crackers were whole grain!    Note: I also noticed that if I drank a lot of sugary drinks the night before (say juices/soda mixed with liquor), there were sure to be new breakouts coming.  I'm sure this would apply to all simple sugars and HFCS.  

**CURRENT DIET**

So starting the week after that (on 7/30) I literally went through my kitchen and threw out ALL of my wheat/grain products.  I also read somewhere that dairy caused acne in some people so I went ahead and eliminated that as well (I'm not really a fan of cheese and milk anyways).  Went to the grocery store and bought vegetables (fresh and a ton of frozen for their price/variety), apples, grapes, cherries, plums, bananas, watermelon, NUTS (almonds, pistachios), canned tuna, chicken legs.  I used coconut oil and lemon juice to stir fry tuna and random veggies every day.  Didn't add extra sugar/salt/sauces.  Snacked on fruits and nuts.  Delicious.  I went out to an Italian restaurant the other night and did have like two rolls of bread but other than that I've been wheat free.  People said that carbs from rice/noodles/bread are what gives us energy to go about our day.  Well I've been eating fruits, nuts, and vegetables for the past month (like our hunter gatherer grandparents) and I've been running around biking, swimming, and going to the gym.  Cool huh.

**CURRENT REGIMEN**

As for my regimen.  I STOPPED using BP and the BHA toner.  I only shower once a day and use only a tiny bit of the neutrogena cleanser (I used to shower up to 3 times or wash my face throughout the day with cleasers).  If I ever want to wash my face I'll just splash cold water on it and wipe with a clean paper towel.  Now I NEVER TOUCH my face or pick at it.  I use the Mario Badescu Buffering lotion on the spots where I've gotten a cystic pimple before which also feel like they might flare up again (you know those spots where the pimple comes back in the EXACT same spot probably due to picking).   I don't use the drying cream anymore.

Current supplements - Red Clover, Zinc, Acidophilus pearls (probiotics for gut).  Also sunlight without sunscreen.

At the moment I still have hyperpigmentation marks from the previous 8 or so years.  There's also an underground bump playing peekaboo with me on my temple.    If a small pimple/whitehead appears I don't do anything (the frequency and severity have definitely gone down).  After the shower I just dab a little buffering lotion and it goes away in 1 or 2 days.  I'm far from being in the clear but It's only been a month and I'm liking what I see so far.  Which is why I'm sharing my wheat-acne connection with you folks!  I hope I covered everything.. probably not, but if you have any questions regarding details, lemme know =]

1358969970.0,21,self.acne,1751h4,A lifestyle change is what helped me,alifestylechange,26,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1751h4/a_lifestyle_change_is_what_helped_me/,"Hi guys, I've never posted on reddit so bear with me. I started to get acne around 15, and my face always looked irritated. Like it was reacting badly to something. Around 19, the acne went down severely but my forehead and nose area still looked red and irritated but mildly. I was getting frustrated as I had tried a few things for mild acne, but nope my face still stayed irritated. So one day I got fed up of looking at the little acne on my forehead and decided I'd just try an entire lifestyle change. Even if it didn't work, I knew it would be good for my body in other ways. I used to think I could never give up my daily iced cappuccino but that day when I woke up, a part of me was willing to let go of it all. So here is what I did to get acne-free. This list is in no particular order

1. I wash my linens every week (I'm sure you've heard this)
2. I started to moisturize my face twice a day. I never used to moisturize before this as I thought my face was oily and did not need moisturizer
3. I completely cut out processed sugars and fast food. I can't remember the last time I went to Mcdonalds or any other fast food chain
4. Absolutely no soda and I keep juice at a minimum, if I feel like I really need something i literally take a shot glass of juice and drink it
5. I eat a piece of dark chocolate every morning
6. I cut out dairy. No milk, no cheese. I just refuse to have it. I just think of it like this ""There is a particular person I want to be, and all of these things are in the way of me becoming that person"". So I have no desire to eat cheese or dairy. Although not everyone's problem is cheese and dairy
7. I eat a handful of almonds everyday
8. The night before, I cut all my fruits and veggies into a box and organize my fridge so the things I need to prepare my healthy meals for the next day are right at the front. This way, I won't look into the fridge, feel overwhelmed and opt for something quick on the go. 
9. I eat my iron pill with an orange every morning. A little later I take vitamin D, and E
10. I make little notes to myself reminding myself of what my end goal is. I want clear skin and a healthy body. I try to keep positive and this keeps me away from slipping into eating bad food.
11. I  try my best to stay away from most dips and dressings. If I am to use a dressing I use balsamic vinegar and as a dip I have hummus. 
12. I wash my face with a cleanser called Fresh from Sephora. When I need to exfoliate I use an Ocean Salt scrub from LUSH. After I exfoliate I leave honey on my face for 20 minutes to get all that moisture back in. Or I just moisturize with my regular moisturizer. 
13. I exercise at least 4 times a week. I noticed that this improved my skin a lot and added a youthful glow back to my skin
14. When I go home from University, I sit in my parent's steam bath for about 20 minutes. You can steam your face over the stove once a week
15. Once every 2 months I get a microdermabrasion
16.I also cut out bread from my diet. I do eat brown rice and quinoa. Just refuse to eat bread anymore. 

Basically I changed my lifestyle around to benefit my health all around. I want to have good self-esteem and good energy to get through my days.  A combination of these things cleared my skin. I'm now 22 and I don't really get spots. Maybe one or two around my period but that's about it. I'm not saying you need to try all of these things, maybe you don't need to do all of these. Essentially what I'm saying is, that your skin's radiance is a product of a combination of things. Changing your lifestyle will most likely improve your skin, especially for mild acne sufferers.

1348001596.0,21,self.acne,103kf7,"Acne, Dating and Self-Esteem",Guyonskis,25,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/103kf7/acne_dating_and_selfesteem/,"Last weekend I was on a date. We are on a sports team together and she ended up asking me out and we had a great time together. When I got home I looked in the mirror and realized I had three whiteheads right near my lips and a nice big one on my forehead. At first it bothered me, but I quickly realized it made no difference. I wondered to myself, if I did know I had these zits would the date have gone differently? If it did go badly would the acne be responsible or would it be me? I thought back to all my past experiences with women and I couldn’t think of a single time where it has ever hindered me directly. This is such an important realization I feel like I had to share it with you guys.

I know many of your first reactions to this will be “Oh big deal, four zits, I’m covered with them!”. Let me tell you it wasn’t always this way. Now I’m 25 and post-Accutane. When I was 15 it was a very different story. I had fairly severe acne and my self-esteem because of it was horrible. I couldn’t walk down the hallway at school without staring at the floor thinking everyone was staring at my horrible, ugly face. I had almost no social life outside of school and at school I only made friends with the other nerdy, unattractive kids. There were girls I liked and I would speak to them, but I would never dream that they would ever be interested in me. I realize now, that even then I could have asked them out and they would have said yes.

When I was in grade 12 nearing the end of high school, I decided I wanted a girlfriend. To me at that time it meant getting a social life, and above all, getting rid of the acne. I tried the various creams and later a few different treatments like tetracycline. None of them made any difference. But I did make new friends and I actively tried to be nice to everyone. Then there was this girl who was in my nerdy circle of friends. She saw potential in me and decided she wanted to date me. I was still so crippled by my lack of confidence she had to walk me through every step of the process. I am so grateful that she had the patience for me. She started the upward spiral. She helped me start the process of learning that my attitude and my positive qualities are far more important than my physical appearance. 

Although she opened my mind to the possibility of women being attracted to me, I was still dwelling on my acne. I only dated the women that were as attractive as I saw myself and the relationships didn’t last long. I still was anxious around groups of people and I was shy. I felt I needed to take the last resort which was Accutane.  As I’m sure most of you know, it gets a lot worse before it gets better. Even as it got worse, everything else in my life did not change. I still had good friends, I still dated and everyone treated me with respect. I even met my first serious girlfriend and my first love. She told me once “I would still love you even if you were one giant zit”. Also when I finished Accutane, and my acne got better, things still did not change. It took a long time to build my confidence to where it is now. It was not the cure-all I expected it to be.

The point I’m trying to make with this story is that acne never stopped me from getting what I want. It was always just my perception of myself. My negative self-image was the only thing holding me back. People do not care all that much how you look. If you are a positive, confident person who works on bettering yourself and who respects and values others, you will be attractive. My success in my social and dating life was solely from cultivating these qualities. It took me a decade to realize it. I hope that I can help some of you come to this realization sooner than I did. I know my life would have been very different.

**TL;DR In most cases, having acne does not significantly influence your attractiveness unless you let it.**

The last time I got one I finally made an appointment with a dermatologist. He told me they will take very long to go away and cannot be treated with topical creams. He then gave me a cortisone injection directly into the cyst, stuck a band-aid on it and sent me home. I kid you not, less than 8 hours later it was 90% gone.

In high school, I didn't even understand how popping worked. Then, one day I was introduced and I've been hooked ever since. I think it's a Pavlovian thing or something. I love the explosion, I love the smell (disgusting but horribly, horribly true.) 

Normally I only get a little acne (used to only be in that T-zone thing) and I pop it. Can't help it, dude. One day, I popped a cheek one and that was it. My face was doomed from that day forward.

Flash forward to today. I've got like 5 or 6 scar tissue spots (I'm not talking those craters that look like a pore. I'm talking super-smooth raised tissue the size of a pea or larger with dark dots inside). My cheeks are ravaged and my forehead is too. Somehow, though, no matter how much I bleed and feel pain, I can't stop. It's like I'm frustrated at myself for being so ugly, so why not just make it a little worse? 

I'm going to a dermatologist in less than a month. Last time I went to her, I was like 17 and couldn't follow a regimen to save my life. She treated me like a 2 year old. We'll see how she feels when my face is as untreatable as this.

(No prescribed medications, no dermatologist visits)",Terribaddie,25,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/shajy/my_new_skin_care_routine_in_detail_its_been_6/,"**Full Disclosure:**

I'd like to begin with stating that I didn't have terribly severe acne when I began this routine, so I can't guarantee you'll have the same results as me if you do. But I'd love to hear some feedback, so let me know if this works out for you!

I've been suffering from acne since I was 15 ( or younger, I don't exactly keep track ). I'm 19 now. I'm a guy (had to include this because the cause of acne be can different when it comes to gender). I'm sure the only reason I kept my mild acne from becoming severe is because I've always taken care of my face and used some treatments. For 4+ years I've battled it, but I have never rid myself of it. I've never seen a dermatologist because I didn't want to spend the money on medicine that may or may not work and could possibly do harm to my health.

&gt;My acne situation at the start of this routine was this: Acne(+sweat bumps) would come and go around my forehead and on my chin (+ areas below and around). I would get rid of this by cleaning my face twice a day with a gentle soap ( things like sacylic acid seemed to only make things worse) and using benzyl peroxide on the areas with acne. Few would pop up on my cheeks, but not very often. This has gone on for 4+ years. At some points I would become mostly-clear, but then the acne would just come back. Of course I tried other things, but that's enough background information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**My Routine**:

If you've been to this subreddit before, it's been stated many times. Every night before I go to bed, I  put a clean towel on top of my pillow case. If you're not washing your pillow case every day it's going to have dirt, sweat, oils, acne bacteria and everything else on it from the nights before. It doesn't matter how well you clean your face, you're doing all the cleaning for nothing if your not sleeping on a clean pillow.

I'll be honest, I don't exactly know what parts of this routine are the   most benefitial, but I do all of it. 

* I am taking Zinc as a supplement. You can read what some people have said about taking Zinc as an acne treatment[ here.](http://www.acne.org/zinc-reviews/200/page1.html) You can also do some google searching. [It's also beneficial to your immune system when it comes to the common cold!](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-zinc-cold-idUSTRE71F3XI20110216) I haven't had any negative side effects, but some people have said they get stomach aches. I take [Good N Natural Zinc For Acne](http://www.amazon.com/Zinc-for-Acne-100-Tablets/dp/B000KI6Z7O); two a day - 1 after breakfast and 1 after dinner. Any other brand will do, just make sure you get the right kind of Zinc that is helpful in combating acne. Also, follow the directions so you don't overdose! Read up on dosage so you don't over do it. And keep in mind, many foods contain Zinc. This may or may not be helpful to you at all. I bought one bottle, and I plan on taking the described amount every day until I'm 100% clear and smooth, and then I will bring my dosage down because it's not healthy to take Zinc over a long period of time.


* In the morning after my shower I wash my face with [Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Complexion-Foaming-Cleanser-6-Ounce/dp/B00006FRW9). Wash your face with what you like, but this is what has worked for me. It contains Sacillyic Acid, it's not too harsh, but can dry your skin. Next, apply a [facial toner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toner_\(skin_care\)). I use [Alba's Hibiscus Facial Toner](http://www.amazon.com/Alba-Naturals-Hibiscus-Facial-Toner/dp/B00120VWSG), you'll just need to find something that works with your skin and within your price range. Immediately afterwards, apply a moisturizer! Yes, even if you're a guy. Trust me. If your face produces a lot of oil, you still want to apply moisturizer. Again, trust me on this; I'm a redditor. Any time you wash your face, be sure to use moisturizer. Over time and usage, your skin will produce less oil because it's already moisturized. Your skin will look great; not dry yet not greasy. Fuck yeah! Use any moisturizer you like, but make sure the description says it's Non-comedogenic (won't clog pores). Fragrances can also be irritating to the skin, so try to find one that is Fragrance-free. If you are out in the sun often then find a SPF moisturizer. Even if you don't go out to often, it could be a good idea. Personally, I use [Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Sensitive Skin.](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Moisture-Sensitive-Ounce) It might seem pricey since it's 4oz, however one pump covers my entire face so I expect the bottle will last a long time. You don't need to overdo your moisturizer otherwise you look like one of them shiny vampires from the Twilight movies. Team Edward!--just kidding. Wait, is Edward even the vampire? Or the wolf bro? Or whatever the fu--anyways moving on

I've been dealing with my acne since the beginning of my freshman year in high school (about 2 years ago). At first it wasn't very bad, just a few bumps on my forehead here and there, so I ignored it. Then as the year went on those bumps progressively became more prominent and one of my classmates told me that it might be the hair on my forehead causing this as the acne was appearing only on my forehead. I decided to change up my hair style so that my hair was no longer covering my forehead and i've left it that way ever since. I hoped that my acne would go away with time but it didn't, so I began washing my face every morning and night with a bar of soap. After months of this, I saw no results but my acne wasn't getting any worse so I just attributed my acne to be related too puberty and waited for it to blow over, except it didn't. Instead, as time went by, my acne slowly spread. At first it was just a few pimples on my cheeks, and then just a few around the edges of my face, and then another few on my chin, and now most recently they've started appearing on my jawline/neck. So over time it got worse. One morning I woke up and I said to myself ""Holy fuck, your face is hideous."" as I began to realize the severity of my acne. When I looked at a picture of my friends and I, I noticed just how bad my acne was in contrast to their clear faces. This realization caused me to order Proactive that same day. After about 2 weeks I began to see results, but all of a sudden I started breaking out again and after about a month and a half, I quit proactive as it was not giving me any results. Now I've been washing my face 2 times a day using a bar of soap that's supposed to help relieve acne, and applying a sort of liquid product (smells a little like alcohol) that my mom bought in Mexico as well as taking 2 pills daily named ""Asepxia"". I've been on this routine for about a week and a half and I see no results. I'm desperate, is there anything I can do? 

Here is my face as of earlier today.

Beware of long ass story inside!,aquaticbub,22,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1e3naf/my_5_month_progress_pics_starting_halfway_trough/,"About 5 months ago, in late December, I woke up and realized holy shit, I have terrible acne. I had never thought of it before, but it just hit me. My face was absolute shit. Boom, from that day on I was depressed every morning. But Im not here to get pity or to tell you how shitty it was - I'm here to inspire those who think they have no hope! I started by going to the derm. Got doxycycline (antibiotic) and epiduo. Told to try it for a month and come back. You see, I had never done research on acne. Didnt know how to pop it (or that you shouldn't!!!), didnt know about scarring, about moisturizing, about benzoyl peroxide, hell I barely knew about washing my face! But I started to fight it. Hard. I tried to scrub it off every night in the shower, washed my face 3-4 times a day thinking it would help. Little did I know I was making it worse. I would go home after rowing practice and just not say a word to my family. I alienated my friends. I would wanna cry but I just couldn't. The depression hit hard and only made it worse. But that was the turning point. I realized I had the most invaluable tool in the world: the Internet. So I came here. And here I thrived. I learned of things I never would've learned myself because no one bothered to teach me: my dad had to work and thought I was being too sensitive about my acne, and I didn't see my mom much. After about 2 weeks of doxycycline, I quit it, being frustrated that I didn't see results. I started on minocycline, hoping for faster, visible results. Little did I know it could take a few months. So boom, month 1 down. Less pimples, still lots of cysts and scars. I hadn't stopped picking (horrible habit!) and hardly watched my diet or what touched my face. And that's when I made a connection. I realized I need to fight this and fight it hard. So I used my biology skills (favorite subject) and looked up how acne was caused, what it was, what scarring/hyper pigmentation was, how to regulate oil, etc. I bought some multivitamins and zinc to combat deficiencies and help skin immunity/healing. Turns out masturbating causes zinc deficiency and can even cause acne, so as hard as it was (no pun intended) quit that. Knocked out all sugar, dairy, and white bread. Never let anything I didn't know was clean touch my face. And that's when I started to see a difference. My skin was loving it. I got moisturizer to help combat the epiduos dryness, and sunscreen to help reduce scarring. After about a month, I took my first progress pic. As you can probably tell I was afraid of cameras. Well that day I felt so good about the progress that I had to take a picture. Now when you see that picture you'll think ""That's progress?!"" But yea. It was. A lot. So, I sputtered along, still depressed, but gaining confidence every day (helps healing too!) and I did some research on why I wasn't 100% clear yet. Fiddled around with some things, and came to a website that claimed something called 'Apple Cider Vinegar' could heal scars and kill acne. Why the hell not. Picked up a bottle and fell IN LOVE. Now some people hate the smell. But you know what it reminds me of now? Salad and kicking acne's ass. My favorite smell. And it's all been downhill from that moment. It started to clear, my scars began to fade, and I felt amazing. Now I had some rough patches when I'd break out from eating dairy, or sugar, or masturbating (probably the most common), but I began to outgrow it. And about 1 week ago, I had the first day in 5 months where I didn't think about how my face looked. To anyone. I didn't care, because it looked fucking awesome. That's when I decided to take another picture. You see, acne beats you physically AND mentally. Makes you feel like shit on the inside too. But you can beat this. After countless people telling me to 'just wash my face' or to 'just eat better', I was done. This is for you out there that feel like giving up. I beg of you to not give in. Don't let acne win. We CAN beat this. We're all here for you. If you need help, never even hesitate to PM me. Ill help however I can with knowledge I wish I had known 6 months ago. And looking back on it, 6 months ain't SHIT. You got this, stud/studette. Have hope.

Fortunately, I was still able to maintain a decent social life in high school and college without too many issues. I just wanted to share a story of freshman year in college. One of my dorm floormates had severe acne. Like REALLY bad. I always felt terrible for him, because I was struggling with my own acne and it wasn't even close to what he had. Anyways while we were eating in the dining hall, a girl walked by our table. He looked up and made eye contact with her. When this happened, she wrinkled her nose and squinted her eyes in a look of disgust while looking directly at him. It hit ME with the force of a ton of bricks (and I wasn't even the one it happened too!) I immediately lost my appetite and felt like total shit. I seriously wanted to kill that girl. I didn't do anything to her, but I seriously regret it.

Acne for me fortunately started at a later age of round 18 years old during my senior year. Prior to this I was just an average guy doing what high school guys did back then which was chasing girls and having a good time. Out of no where acne started to appear ,by each passing month things gradually grew worst and my hormonal small acne have now become the behemoth called cystic acne. 

Things started to take a turn in my social life and I became another person. My confidence dropped dramatically and it affected everything I did. I was at the stage where I people around me were getting more distant and distant. I was always the nice guy that treated everyone with respect and never hurt anybody so I guess that kind of helped with people not being as judgmental. There was a kid during the lower grade who was constantly picked on because of acne and now I have acne which is twice as bad so that didn't really help my self esteem either. When friends called me out I constantly made excuses not to go because my acne was that bad. How could I have fun when I can't even smile without it hurting? How could I even ask a girl out when I can't even look at myself in the mirror? Things got pretty bad and I finally .went to a dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane. This was my hail Mary my one last shot if that didnt work I didn't know what else to do. I was ready to give up and throw the towel in.

6 months after the course I felt like a new person fired up for a new life a change in perspective on life. I was starting my first year at college doing my dream course which I've dreamt of for so long of and being acne free boosted my confidence. My social life slowly crept back and the cheerful and carefree guy who I used to love came back. However this did not last long. 6 months after my acne started to crept back ,feeling defeated and powerless I spiralled into a darker endless circle of depression. I started to isolate my friends again. My friends till this day think the reason I don't hang with them because I'm studying (yes I study but not all day everyday ). This depression went on for another 3 years until I finally took my second course. 

Today marks the day that I'm clear and finished with the second course. Looking back on everything acne has pretty much shaped me  
physically and emotionally to the point that it will always be part of me now. But there is one thing I regret the most pushing people that I really cared about the most. Pushing away the girl that I really cared for because I'm a perfectionist and I felt that she didn't deserve someone as hideous as me. This was one of the reason acne was so hard since I  was a perfectionist who always had control of my life such as studying and sports ,everything I tried to fix the acne was pointless. Hundreds of dollars thrown down the drain and countless of products nothing worked. I'm now at the point where its a bitter sweet feeling where I'm clear but I still feel empty hence why I'm rambling on like an idiot.I don't know if anyone is going to read this or if its going to get buried but I felt like I needed to express what I felt in words somehow.It really hurts to realise the mistake that I've made nothing really compares to letting yourself down and other around you down.

I went to a client meeting one time, and my acne wasn't even that bad that day, but of course I was still very subconscious about it.  After about 30 minutes, the client said, ""hey helloverld, have you been eating a lot of greasy food lately?""  Of course, I had not.  I'd been eating extremely healthy, lots of water, blah blah blah.  But I knew what he was getting at.  It was humiliating.  And he proceeded to lecture me about what I should do about it.  

The most annoying thing is when people make these obvious, stupid suggestions like, ""you should wash your face more"".  I've spent thousands of dollars, tried cream after cream, prescription antibiotics, ate healthy, worked out 6 days a week (strength and cardio), never miss a shower, change my pillowcase every day, etc etc and your suggestion is that I need to wash my face?  FUCK YOU!  and fuck acne.

The condition I have which causes the acne supposedly does not have a cure.  The potential triggers are EVERYTHING.  Cold weather, hot weather, the sun, coffee, milk, meat, warm showers, fucking everything.  It's like playing a game which cannot be beaten.

My best friend's wedding is in a month and i'm supposed to rsvp soon, but I'm 99% sure I won't go even though I wish like hell I could.  I can't bear them seeing me like this.  No matter what you say, they will assume that it's your fault, you either don't shower enough, you can't handle life and stress too much, you're unhealthy, etc.  I can't bear it.  I don't want them to see me like this, and have them think of me as pathetic.

I've sometimes tried to convince myself that it's just in my head and no one really cares or notices, but right when I think that, someone will mention it to me in front of a whole group of people.  I hate making eye contact with people, because they never hold the eye contact, I can always see their gaze shift towards my face.  I can't bear to be in public anymore and I've gone from social butterfly to having borderline agoraphobia.  I used to think that heaven and hell didn't exist but now I believe it does, and it exists right here on Earth.  I've been living in hell the past 5 years and I'm just so tired of it.  I don't have the energy anymore.  I don't even cry about it because I don't feel anything anymore.  It's like some sort of sick joke.  Maybe someday I can wake up from this nightmare.  

I've been hiding in my room the past 2 weeks since my latest horrific outbreak, my roommates probably think i'm a fuckin weirdo or something, since I only come out once everyone is asleep.  I used to work out 6 days a week, but I've stopped altogether because working out is yet another trigger.  I've skipped classes because I hate people staring at my face.  I'm just really tired of this.  Anyway, thanks for listening.

Hi Tracy!

I really liked this post and thought I’d add one idea to it.

Some time ago I made a discovery (based on your main idea that stress = acne) about my internal dialog when it comes to facing the mirror. Although we can just ignore the mirror altogether in the hopes that we don’t stress as much about our acne, that doesn’t really solve the problem of feeling miserable when we look at ourselves eventually – it just prolongs it.

So how do we address the REAL issue of feeling miserable while looking at ourselves in the mirror and only seeing acne? How do we eliminate the stress of seeing yet another spot of red on our face?

The answer I found really changed things around for me (and I owe this discovery in part to you!).

The problem is, we look at ourselves and think the opposite of what we want to think about ourselves. We look at ourselves and think we look terrible, or that we aren’t beautiful, or we aren’t lovable, or one hundred other miserable stories. These stories tend to run our lives and have us racing ourselves to the mirror to get the latest update on the most recent acne.

So! The discovery I made was this: Love the acne.

I know it’s gonna sound a bit crazy at first, but honestly, ignoring the problem and imagining life without it just makes it worse when you go back to the mirror eventually and see how much acne you still have. So what needs to happen is a sort of “understanding” of the acne, or really, of the person behind the acne, because the more you understand something, the more you love it.

The thing is, you need to look at yourself in the mirror, and really see the person who’s hurting, who’s been telling them-self they are ugly and unworthy of love, because really and simply, that person just wants to be loved. So that’s what we do. We give that person love.

And how do we give that person love?

Imagine for a moment the feeling of having someone you trust, look directly into your eyes and tell you they love everything about you. Or imagine someone kissing each spot of acne on your face, and telling you they love the flawed and beautiful you, exactly as you are. THAT’S the feeling you want to have when you look in the mirror. One of gratitude that someone could love you THAT much; a feeling of acceptance for who you are; compassion for the hurting person you see in the mirror every day. That kind of feeling is the OPPOSITE of stress – which is the opposite of acne!

So really, in the end what it comes down to, is accepting your own feelings and showing compassion for yourself. And I don’t mean you in particular, Tracy, but just a general “you” to each of us who fight it.

I think we need to accept the feelings we have about ourselves and tell ourselves it’s ok to feel the feelings of fear, rejection, loneliness or worry because those feelings are there for a reason. These feelings are there to tell us something, and if we can accept them instead of fight them, we are a good step closer to living a happier life – and totally, finally free of acne!

1350494351.0,18,self.acne,11n0eo,4 year Redditor here on a throwaway. Four hours of using hydrocolloid patches just helped more than four years of...everything. ,acnefixthrowaway,23,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/11n0eo/4_year_redditor_here_on_a_throwaway_four_hours_of/,"Hey guys. I'm here to inquire about how many of you have ever used these patches. Hydrocolloid patches are intended for burn victims. From Wikipedia:

&gt; The active surface of the dressing is coated with a cross-linked adhesive mass containing a dispersion of gelatin, pectin and carboxy-methylcellulose together with other polymers and adhesives forming a flexible wafer. In contact with wound exudate, the polysaccharides and other polymers absorb water and swell, forming a gel which is held within the structure of the adhesive matrix. The moist conditions produced under the dressing are intended to promote fibrinolysis, angiogenesis and wound healing, without causing softening and breaking down of tissue. The gel which is formed as a result of the absorption of wound exudate is not mobile and free running but held within the structure of the adhesive matrix. Most hydrocolloid dressings are waterproof, allowing normal washing and bathing.

-----------------------------

After years of trying just about everything, I had a pretty bad experience yesterday. Due to dry air, my skin had those white flecks (I guess dumping a bunch of benzyl peroxide on my face every night didn't help much). This morning I used a washcloth and exfoliated, which popped open some of the acne on my face. This of course caused bleeding, irritation, etc. Try as I might to make it look manageable, I had to head to work. 

What followed was an excruciating morning meeting where 15 people were straight up staring at my acne. It was really scabby, red, and very, *very* noticeable. Not good.

I was fucking pissed. I haven't looked this bad, ever. As a 22 year old male in otherwise perfect health, I looked like a fucking pubescent high schooler. 

I decided that what I was doing wasn't working, so I went to scope out something I'd missed. I walked by any store that looked like it had a product that could help. I was feeling low and hearing salespeople look at me and say, ""natural men's skin care for face!"" (because Asia) was not helpful.

Ugh. 

**End of background / sob story**.

------------------------------

Eventually I settled on something I had heard about while my aunt was in the hospital for a pretty bad burn on her arm. The problem was, the wounds were having trouble healing due to all the stuff that's associated with burns: lots of puss, blood, etc really slows down the healing process and apparently also causes excess scarring. 

Considering my problem was that I had exfoliated and caused puss / bleeding on the acne on my cheeks, I figured that this could really, really help out. I went to a local medical supply store and tried to see if they would sell DuoDERM, Granuflex or Tegaderm -- three of the 'medical' brands I'd heard about. None of them had the sort of volumes I'd need. 

I was however able to found a product that is honestly just amazing. The aforementioned products are designed to treat burns, and as such are pretty huge. At the bottom of the shelf recessed in a dusty corner was a product called the **Nexcare Acne Dressing**. What caught my eye was the 3M logo -- they're the manufacturers of Tegaderm.

I opened up the outer cardboard box and inside was a **sterilized pouch**, exactly what you'd find in a hydrocolloid dressing for burn victims. Exactly what I was looking for at the medical supply store.

The English directions on the back say,

1) Clean and dry skin and hands thoroughly.  
2) Remove the film at the back of an acne dressing and cover it on the acne. Fix it tightly by pressing on the rim.  
3) Replace when the acne dressing turns white (indicating full absorption of secretion).  
4) Store unused acne dressing in a cool, dry place.  
5) The acne dressing should be applied before wearing make up.

I picked up three boxes of the stuff (it looked like there isn't much per box) and set on my way home. Got home, made and ate dinner, then looked at what I had bought.

When you tear open the sterile paper, you see a wafer of two plastic sheets with round 'gummy' circles. These gummy circles are pretty sticky -- they're self-adhesive -- but one side is stickier than the other. I washed my face with *generic anti-acne face wash*, to just get the area clean, oil-free, etc etc and all the other marketing they claim will fix acne. I pressed a paper towl on to my face and peeled it off. I waited about a minute as some of the acne was bleeding / puss-y, then I used another paper towl to do the same thing. 

I rubbed in some OXY 10. 

I grabbed a pair of tweezers and sterilized the tips with rubbing alcohol, then peeled back one layer of plastic, making sure to delicately grab the hydrocolloid patches. I put the sticky side directly on to the larger acne on my face. I made sure to cover each one that had secreted either blood or puss after using my washcloth.

Then I watched a movie and went to bed. 

I'm here now to say that this is the most night and day difference I've ever had. I've tried every thing on the market short of Accutane (I value my colon, thank you very much) and *nothing* has worked. 

I have a few suggestions on why these patches may be so ridiculously successful: 

1) They trap bacteria-filled puss and blood that would otherwise spread the *Propionibacterium acnes* and *Staphylococcus epidermidis* bacteria.  
2) They suck puss and blood *out of* acne, reducing the 'swollen, red, inflamed' look.  
3) They prevent picking, scratching, etc. They prevent the sores from being disturbed when I roll over in my sleep.

---------------------------------

That's about it. I'm fucking ecstatic right now that I've found out such an amazing way to treat something that's not only been physically uncomfortable for all of my adult life, but something that's psychologically killed my self esteem. My job involves a great deal of 'face time' and presentations, and getting up on stage when you feel like you look terrible is a feeling I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

I'm only one day into this treatment. This post is almost certainly jumping the gun. This healing might only be temporary, might not last another day, might not actually cause my acne to go away -- but it really is truly unbelievable that so much has happened in seven hours of one application.

I wanted to share this news with you fine ladies and gents on this subreddit...I sincerely hope that this is something that's gone under the radar in the incredibly frustrating and pseudo-scientific marketing-driven anti-acne industry, and not a form of quack science that I'm drawing improper conclusions from.

Please, please, please get the dialog going on what these amazing patches are. I searched for ""hydrocolloid"" on this subreddit and didn't come up with anything.

1370241726.0,17,self.acne,1fkg0f,So after about a year of personal experimentation I have come to the conclusion: shampoo and conditioners can cause body acne.,itsallonme,20,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1fkg0f/so_after_about_a_year_of_personal_experimentation/,"I rarely see either of these products mentioned in regards to acne. I guess they're so ubiquitous and needed that no one stops to think that they might be skin irritants. What runs off your head runs down your body. First stops: neck, back and chest. (Some of the most acne-ridden body parts.) 

About a year ago I was so fed up with my body acne. I had horrible chest acne (I'm a girl, which makes it super embarrassing because most female shirts show your chest/cleavage) and back acne, it wouldn't go away and it was hard to treat. One day I was sadly gazing upon my disfigured visage when I realized that all of the most hard-hit areas were the places where water in the shower and out of the shower would run down my body the most. (In between boobs and shoulder blades.) 

So I did a little experiment. I stopped using conditioner in the shower completely. Now, to be honest, this didn't completely clear me up. But it made things noticeably better, and the outbreaks weren't so bad. For a while I got so used to this (almost) acne-less existence that I thought it was safe to use conditioner again. Within the week, my body acne was back with full reddened force. I had real evidence. 

I read a post similar to this on this sub after that about using Selsun Blue 3% salicylic acid shampoo and that has actually eliminated my body acne at times, combined with the cessation of using conditioner while in the shower. (it is important to note that regular sulfate-filled shampoo is also bad, but it's near-impossible to stop using shampoo so I do the best I can.) 

So there you go reddit. It's not a complete cure, but if you struggle with weird acne patterns there may be a reason you don't particularly think of. ",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_1fkg0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1fkg0f/so_after_about_a_year_of_personal_experimentation/,

I will be on Accutane for only 1 more month and I'd say that it has been totally worth it so far! 

The only thing really left to improve is the hyper-pigmentation marks on my face from old pimples, but they are healing albeit slowly.

Here's what worked for me: Acetyl-L Carnitine + Pantothenic Acid (B5) Combo and acne.org BP",t3hbwang,22,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/19ekrk/ive_had_acne_since_i_was_13_now_im_pretty_much/,"My background: Asian male, started breaking out around 13 and it got really bad when I was 14. I'm writing this in hopes that this will work for someone else and help their case out. I know the struggle and how bad it feels to have acne, I've been there. Nowadays I'm happy with my skin and no longer worry about it.

Around 14 I would get minor cysts and a lot of whiteheads/papules/pustules. Didn't help my case by popping a large portion of them. Did a ton of research and tried a ton of over-the-counter products and home remedies, but nothing worked until I got prescribed retin-A micro and benzaclin by my doctor when I was around 14. I was clear for a bit after the retin-A + benzaclin but my mom decided it was too expensive to continue the prescription so I stopped using it. I was clear for about a year before the acne flared up again.

Acne was kept mostly in check in high school by using benzaclin and acne.org's 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel. I'd have occasional flare-ups and periods of where it was really bad but generally speaking when I was on benzaclin I was okay. 

In college my acne was never a huge problem, can't say enough good things about acne.org's 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel as I've used that consistently throughout college and it has worked for me. I would just slather a ton on my face and it was usually enough to quickly eliminate new pimples. However I would still get occasional flareups (for me I notice that if I don't get at least 7 hours of sleep, I'm more prone to breaking out). This probably had to do with the fact that I wasn't really exercising and had a typical unhealthy college student's diet.

I finally started exercising regularly when I was around 20 in preparation for Marine Corps Officer Candidate School (officer boot camp). I think this in conjunction with the 2.5% acne.org gel kept me clear for most of sophmore-junior year of college. 

However I went to OCS between my junior-senior year of college and it destroyed my face. The stress, regulations, and lack of sleep led me to completely neglect taking care of my face. I think for the first 1.5 months I just used a really abrasive scrub. Shaved quickly with a razor which would often tear open my pimples. I was breaking out pretty badly but I didn't care at the time, just wanted to get through OCS. At some point in time I bought an OTC benzoyl peroxide but it didn't do much. After OCS my face was in pretty bad shape, maybe about 10-12 papules/pustules, whiteheads, and small cysts. My skin worsened until about October/November of my senior year. What worked as a miracle for me was Patricia Wexler's anti-acne wash (sadly I think it's discontinued). It was a salicylic acid wash that really started to clear me up. After about two weeks using that and acne.org's benzoyl peroxide gel I finally started clearing up. I'd still get the occasional inflamed pimple but nothing as bad as earlier that year.

I stuck with the regimen of Patricia Wexler's anti-acne wash in the morning, and cetaphil cleanser + acne.org BP gel at night for a couple of months until that summer. Now I was 22, starting my first full-time job, when all of a sudden I started to get crazy breakouts. I had no idea what was going on, and the original regimen I was on was no longer working. I was still exercising, drinking water, and eating relatively healthy.

The breakouts continued and one day I got a huge cystic pimple, no joke it was almost the size of a dime. That was the day I resolved to kill the acne from the inside out instead of applying mitigating measures after the pimple had already formed. I did research and stumbled upon a lot of people claiming success with pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5). 

I figured it was worth a shot. Some people on B5 take about 5-10 pills a day in order for it to work. I didn't want to take that many pills so I followed the route of pairing Vitamin B5 with Acetyl-L Carnitine to help with the absorption. I tried this regimen and immediately noticed my skin starting to calm down. Before I'd feel a new pimple forming nearly every day, however after i started the B5+Acetyl-L Carnitine combo I'd go a couple days without any pimples, and if I did get any they were small enough that they disappeared after a day or two. (I was still using Patricia Wexler in the AM and Cetaphil + BP in the PM).

Quickly my scars began to fade and this is the regimen I still use to this day. It's only two pills a day, no noticeable side effects, and from what I've researched the combo is supposed to give you an energy boost (not sure if I've really noticed one), and fairly inexpensive -- you can buy about a 3 month supply of the supplements from any nutrition store for about 30-40 bucks total (less if there are sales). This is the only method I've used that really attacks acne from it's source and prevents the pimples from forming in the first place. There's a ton of resources online if you google and there's even an MD who writes about the science behind it and also did a study on its efficacy. I highly encourage you all to do your research as I did to find the optimum dosage for yourself.

After starting the B5/Acetyl-L Carnitine regimen, I'm a lot more relaxed about my face. I'll sometimes skip a day or two of BP (especially if I'm traveling), and sometimes I'll won't even take the pills every day. I did read that in the beginning you need to be very consistent in taking them but you can taper off awhile to see how your body reacts. For me, I've gone a period of 4-5 days without taking them but noticed I started breaking out so I won't go any longer than that.

Here's my current regimen below:
AM: Patricia Wexler anti-acne scrub / Cetaphil facial wash
Shave with DE razor and aveeno shaving cream (the sensitive skin one)
1 500mg Pantothenic acid tablet, 1 500mg acetyl-l carnitine tablet. I usually eat this with breakfast. Also the brand I use is ""now""

PM: Shower, cetaphil cleanser, acne.org's 2.5% BP gel, sometimes I'll use the acne.org AHA+ in conjunction with BP, I find it helps with scarring and also works to even skin tone and helps treat acne more effectively  

I exercise regularly and eat relatively healthy.. maybe about 60% of the time and try to drink a lot of water as well.
                                                      
This is what works really well for me. Even if I get lousy sleep, which usually causes me to break out, this combo keeps it in check. I still have some minor scarring but I figure that will fade with time. The pantothenic acid treatment isn't too expensive and I wish I'd found this out earlier. Would have saved me a lot of headache/heartache. Please feel free to ask any questions! I'd love to answer them and help you guys all get clear :) It's such an amazing feeling.

1344386622.0,19,self.acne,xur97,Clearest skin I've ever had after firing my Dermatologist (regimen inside),quikwon,22,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/xur97/clearest_skin_ive_ever_had_after_firing_my/,"So, I've been on every product conceivable (except for accutane), and nothing seemed to be working.  After three months on a regimen given to me by my dermatologist, my skin was worse than ever. Flaky and overly dry in some parts, super oily in other parts, and pimples all along my cheeks and jaw. I am also no stranger to cystic acne, which has plagued me for years.

So what did I do? I had had enough. I was tired of spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on doctors appointments, injections, different creams, and antibiotics. Nothing had worked, and if anything, my skin was getting worse. So I fired the guy. There could only be one explanation for nothing working. I came to the conclusion that most of my acne was being caused by all the stuff I was doing to my skin to prevent acne! My skin wasn't being allowed to reset itself to its natural state.

So what do I do now? Topically, I do nothing. Zip. Nada. I don't wash my face. I don't scrub it either. I just let it be. I only let water hit it in the shower. Does my face look dirty? Not at all. It feels better than it has in YEARS.

I've supplemented this with....supplements. I did some reading about how keeping the colon healthy and regular helps in keeping your skin clear. Apparently, if toxins start building up in the gut and can't leave the body the normal way, then they will end up coming out through the skin. Detoxifying the gut has been an important step towards getting rid of my acne.

So, here is my full regimen:

1. Don't touch your face. Ever.
2. Change your pillow case every few days, or use the towel method. Don't use fabric softener with anything that touches your face.
3. Sleep on your back if at all possible. I had to retrain how I slept and it is still difficult. Whenever I sleep on my side, I sometimes get inflammation on that side.
4. For shaving, pick up a twin blade razor like the Sensor Excel. More blades seem to cause more irritation, and they are also ridiculously unwieldy. I switched from a Fusion to the Sensor Excel, and while seeming like a downgrade, I am much happier with the results and the shaving experience. If you have very light facial hair like mine, shave in the shower using only water. If you have thicker facial hair, I recommend using the Gillette Series shaving cream. I'm also aware that a lot of men swear by their DE safety razors. Because of my facial hair type, this kind of razor is unnecessary for me, so I can't speak to its efficacy with acne.
5. THE ONLY THING ALLOWED TO TOUCH YOUR FACE IS WATER (with exception of shaving cream). This also includes towels. Do not use anything to dry your face. Splash water on it, then let it air-dry.
6. Supplements! In the morning after breakfast, take 1 multivitamin made specifically for you gender, 2 psyllium fiber pills, 1 probiotic pill, and 1 fish oil pill. After lunch, take 2 fiber pills. After dinner, take 2 fiber pills and 1 fish oil pill
7. drink lots and lots of water

And that's pretty much it. I've been an acne sufferer for over eight years, and guess what? After firing my dermatologist and picking up this regimen, for the first time in my life I had NO ACNE. It was gone. Completely. And for a fraction of the cost.

It is now six months later and my acne has not returned.

STUFF I USE:

Multivitamin: http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Opti-Men-Multivitamins-180-Count/dp/B0015R3AAO/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336959006&amp;sr=8-1-spell)

fiber: http://www.amazon.com/Foods-Psyllium-Husk-500mg-Capsules/dp/B0013OW2KS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336959210&amp;sr=8-1

probiotic: http://www.amazon.com/Phillips-Colon-Health-Probiotic-Supplement/dp/B002OAQBSO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336959239&amp;sr=8-2

fish oil: http://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Natural-Concentrate-Omega-3/dp/B000EQW3ZA/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336959252&amp;sr=8-4

Note: A word of warning. For the first few days that you stop washing/moisturizing your face, it will dry out A LOT. It will get flaky and not look that great, but you need to power through it. Start this regimen on a Friday after work and suffer through the weekend. When its time to get back to work, most of the dead skin will be gone. Do not try to manually exfoliate it, as that can inflame the skin.

Good luck.

Bonus tip: If you have back/body acne, wear a clean t-shirt to bed every night. Don't re-wear the shirt until it gets washed.

[I apply a couple drops of this only in the morning as a moisturizer](http://sohacollections.com/images/P/Bio_Oil_60ml_4bfff369deb89.gif)

So far my face has been completely normal. I don't get oily throughout the day like I used to, and my chin area(which was the worst since it was more acne prone and dryer than the rest of my face) has been normal. I *do* still have acne, as is apparent in my pictures, but it's really only one or two that're active, the rest that you see are actually just blemishes left behind from past flare-ups. 

If I had to recommend one product from my regimen above, it would have to be the Burt's Bees blemish stick. I have sensitive skin and a lot of toners I've used have made my face worse, but this product was effective for me. The only bad thing about it is the price and how little product you get, but I'm willing to pay since it has been working for me. 

Thanks to Inequilibrium for their tips, I've been more gentle with washing my face now. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask. If all goes well I'll post an update a month from now(hopefully my face will be completely clear by then). Thanks for reading. :)

[after](http://i.imgur.com/dkfsz.jpg)

From 8th grade through my senior year of college, I was plagued with lots of acne and painful cysts all over my face. Every product I tried, in any amount (including no products for a while) did absolutely nothing to help.

Until I went on a mostly Paleo diet. Essentially, I don't eat any wheat, soy, and next to no corn or sugar. I occasionally eat dairy, usually in the form of full fat Greek yogurt.

Because of this, I am convinced, *at least in my case*, that diet was the main cause of acne.

This has absolutely been life changing, and the health benefits have been absolutely worth giving up pizza and other processed foods.

My changes took place over several months, and I have been free of these foods for almost a year.

I hope this post helps someone to figure out how to help their own acne.

Hopefully this will help some of you with stubborn acne.,Dk333,22,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/zyrg2/finally_clear_hopefully_this_will_help_some_of/,"After 7 years of acne, this is the clearest i have been since i was 13 (im 20 now). I have tried absolutely everything but accutane. I did antibiotics, hundreds of cleansers, bp, salicylic acid, toners, diets, and exercise. Not a single one helped my acne. So here is my story.

About 4 weeks ago, my acne was awful. I had about 5 or so cysts and tons of whiteheads on my jaw line, upper cheek, and forehead. I decided i was done with this shit and I was gunna go on accutane after trying everything. I went to the derm and told him i was ready to try accutane (i wanted to exhaust all efforts before going on accutane, i have had some irritable bowel issues in the past so i was afraid it would cause it to flare up, but at this point it was worth it because i was so horribly depressed and miserable).

So i do the bloodtests and all the paper work and i was ready to start. I get the prescription and go to the pharmacy a few days after to pick it up. In hindsight, im happy it happened, but this day was seriously one of the worst days in my life. The copay for accutane was 530 dollars. My dads insurance didnt cover any of the perscriptions. I looked online, called 5 different pharmacies, and even asked if there was some financial aid programs. Nothing. My heart sank. So here is were the good news starts!

Since I had nothing to try left, I decided to try something i had read on acne.org forum. The caveman regimen. I dismissed it before because i thought, how the hell would stop washing my face help my acne? Acne is caused by your face being dirty, and your pores being clogged with oil  and bacteria, but like i said, i had nothing to lose. So I stopped washing my face completely. I thought, ""what the hell do i have to lose"". 2 weeks later, my face started to clear up, and I was baffled. I showered every day, but I only let water touch my face every few days. I didn't scrub, nothing, just let the oil and dead skin build up. 3-4 days in, my face looks like a wreck. Old acne was still their, and there was a lot of oil and dead skin, but oddly enough, no new acne popping up. I decided to stick with it for another week or two, and I'm so happy i did.
 

I then had a revelation. Every teenager gets acne. That's apart of puberty. The only problem is that i over reacted. Ever since i was 13, i was scrubbing my face twice a day, religiously. My face has always been dry. My t-zone has always been uncontrollably oily, my acne was always red and inflamed, but it was completely caused by over washing and not letting my skin do its own thing. 3 weeks later, I have some existing scars, and 1 zit on the side of my cheek, but my face is 95% clearer, and my complexion and dark marks look SO MUCH better.

So, for people with acne that wash their face twice a day and see no difference, i strongly suggest you try this method. People arn't meant to scrub their face twice a day and constantly be slathering their faces in chemicals. Honestly give this a try for a few weeks and see what happens, if whatever you are doing isnt working, you have nothing to lose. This is the happiest i've been in the last few years. These last two years has been a very dark time in my life, and im so excited to start living again and having confidence. Love you guys, and I genuinely wish you the best of luck.

Come my 13th birthday, I have suffered from acne. Initially quite mild and only minorly bothersome, it was nothing I needed to worry about. Then over the years, it got worse. And worse. And worse. I'm 16 now, and in the last few months it got to the point where I would sometimes have difficulty sleeping due to face pain, or my cheeks would swell up.

I've been to numerous dermatologists, over the years applied probably the equivalent of a bath tub full of creams, tried the towel-on-pillow-each-night method, you name it. The only option I haven't tried is the no-dairy diet; however I only found out about it recently, and if I did try it I would have no way of telling what is working. So the milk and cheese stays.

**The action:**
Recently I decided I'd take my chances with Accutane. I've heard the good and the bad, and I've talked to a doctor and a dermatologist about it, and they both recommended it. I understand the risk, and I'm taking it.

**The diary:**
I'm going to post here pictures of my progress (if any), along with a small text entry. I was originally going to post every day, but due to general laziness never got round to it, and I figure it's better to post when there's some significant progression anyway.

Not much change; this is my face on a good day. Face is still pretty sore.

**Day 12**

Pretty significant difference. Lips are dry as fuck and require constant lip balm, back pain has started and is pretty prevalent. But overall, my face feels much smoother and doesn't hurt. No new spots. Most of what you can see is scarring.

One day i wanted to make a chance and started getting my shit together, i lost weight, got fit and started to feel more confident, everything was alright. But then some time ago i started getting acne, really bad acne, and i started hating myself again.
I rarely go outside, play computergames all day and almost only talk to people online, simply because i hate myself so much.
I am afraid of what people think when going outside, I dont want people to laugh or point at me, everytime I am outside and people start talking near me I think they are making fun of me. I feel disgusting. I have visited the dermatologist multiple times and nothing has worked so far.

FYI I am a 19 year old Dutch boy

Backstory I always had oily skin and acne, went to my GP when I was 14 year old and got prescribed Differin (adapalene) and used it for about 2-3 years and allowed me to life a ""normal"" puberty with from time to time some pimples, but still my skin was oily all the time. So my 18 birthday comes around feeling confident because I lost 44 lbs, only then suddenly acne comes around and unlike before it was alot. So I decide to go to my GP again he decides to prescribe me tetracycline, mean while I get depressed, I am afraid to go outside and as a result dropped out of college and rarely came outside. Luckily my parents are understanding and understood that pushing me to go outside would just make me more miserable. Anyway the tetracycline made me noxious all the time and barely put a dent in the acne, so he prescribes me doxycycline and after that minocycline, all that didnt work and just made me hopeless since 4 months had passed and my life is put on hold. My GP forwarded me to a dermatologist who prescribed me accutane 40mg a day and needed to get a bloodtest done monthly and told me to read the side effects. 1 month passes by havent noticed any side effects and the size of the pimples had decreased significantly only problem the bloodtest came out a bit worry some so the dermatologist decided to reduce it to 30mg a day month two comes along the acne has dissapeared almost completely and only red scars remain and some pimples, bloodtest is good so it keeps going this way a few months pass and I am starting to get back into life I am going outside again meeting my friends etc I apply for college again everything goes great the only side effects are dry lips, dry eyes in the morning and backpain/legpain after working out. The treatment goes on and after a year of taking accutane I have zero pimples and zero blackheads and best of all life is smiling again for me. This was 4 months ago and my skin is almost the same as when I quit accutane. The only permenant side effect is mildly dry lips. Just wanted to share my story.

Usual backstory, I've had acne since high school, it sucks I hate it so bad I want to rip my face off sometimes. I tried every off the shelf acne cream, cleanser, spot reducer, and lotion. They worked sometimes, but never really that great or for that long. 

However, over the last year I have seen a gradual decline in my acne due to some actions on my part and in the last forty five days it has been virtually non-existant, so amazing!

Anyways, here is what has done it for me. 

* I have been on Minocycline for about a year which has helped some but by no means was a magic cure. I think it helps, for me at least. 

* I saw the largest improvement in my acne after I stopped touching my face. This was much harder than it sounds but the difference really showed. Every single time I would go to touch my face I would try to be conscious of it and not do it. It took months to deprogram myself from doing this but its a huge help. Now, if I absolutely have to touch my face I use my knuckle. 

* I no longer use any acne cleansers or scrubs or lotions. Now, I'm not sure what affect this really has but I do know that In the past forty five days when I have had the lowest, read almost no, acne since High school or about five years ago I have not used any cleanser or spot reducer or anything

* And finally, I think what really pushed me over the edge is eating UBER healthy. This was purely incidental. I'm cutting down to get into beach shape for summer and I eat super healthy. I can't even remember the last time I ate fried foods and I rarely eat processed foods. I think that my awesome diet, combined with everything listed, is what really took me over the edge. 

The feeling of waking up every morning, looking in the mirror, and not seeing any of those hellish whiteheads is amazing. Oh man I love it. 

So yeah, as you can see I never found a magic pill cure. It was a combination of a couple of things over about a year. Probably the biggest thing would be to not touch your face or pick your acne.

At fourteen, I began getting cystic acne. I didn't really think much about it until people I considered to be my friends started commenting on it. This hurt tremendously, as anyone who has gone through acne trauma knows. I didn't want to go out of the house. I NEVER looked in mirrors. I had 'meltdowns' frequently and even got into fights with my parents about it. 

The worst about it was, it was a vicious cycle. The medicine that I was using (over the counter scrubs) made my face peel. This made me use moisturizer, which made me break out. I would use make up to cover these break outs and this just exacerbated the problem further. 

Years passed, and eventually I grew out of my semi-depressive adolescence. But the acne did not go away as my parents promised it would. Finally, I took matters into my own hands. I went to see a dermatologist who went through a bunch of combinations of oral and topical medications for my acne. She listened to my problems and finally we found the right combination (differin, benzaclin, oxy face wash, doxycycline pills). I have stopped wearing make up (though this was tough at first--I wanted to cover those pimples!) but this has helped tremendously too.  My skin has cleared up and I feel worlds better about myself.

What works for some people doesn't work for others, some potentially good advice is very incomplete, and things that are commonly believed to be good or bad for acne are often incorrectly perceived. 

I'd like to put together a single post that can answer most questions, linking to useful websites, going through treatments, lifestyle, and other acne-related advice. I'd like it to be a lot more based in actual science and research than most of the advice handed out on reddit (anecdotes can be utterly worthless), but that's hard give the depressing lack of research that's been done into a lot of areas (e.g. diet and acne). A lot of people suffer as a result of that lack of information, but I think we should do what we can, since it seems like so many redditors are dealing with it, and it's one of the few areas where reddit seems to give largely poor information.

I've already typed out the beginnings of something which I was going to post, but I thought I'd look for some input first. Actual resources would be good, but even your own experiences with some things or anything useful you've picked up may be helpful to others.

I've battled with severe acne. I tried tons of products. Neutrogena, Noxema, Clearasil, Cetaphil, Acnefree, Clinique, St. Ives, Proactive, Aveeno, Honey Masks, Aspirin Masks, Coconut Oil, Olive Oil I could name more but you get the point. I also try to maintain a healthy diet while exercising regularly. Not saying that these options don't work at all, some may have helped reduce the breakouts I did have but I couldn't fully say my skin was clear. 

I started to just accept that I have crappy severe acne-prone skin. My face routine became more of wishful thinking than apparent positive results. My boyfriend who has seen me struggle with acne for the past year trying these different products suggested: no soap no more skin care products for 10 days. He added the 10 days because at first I was reluctant, It's craaazy talk. But really I have nothing to lose. 

So here I am, day 3 into my progress. I figured I share with you guys because I never see any daily or routinely ""skin updates"" on regimens.

* What I'm working with (My skintype):

I would say I have sensitive skin, with redness as well. Varying on the weather I have extremely oily skin when it's hot and dry when it's cold.  My acne problem areas are mostly on my cheeks and sides of my face. Ranging in cystic acne to small blemishes. I also have hyper-pigmentation from previous acne. 

This is my skin as of now. (Day 3) I will try to post better pictures as I go along.

Better or I like to say harsh lighting:

[2b](http://i.imgur.com/6joUNJS.jpg?2)

* The plan/regimen: 

No soap, No skin care products for 10 days. Maybe more if I start to see great results by then. It's similar to the caveman regimen except less... caveman-like. I wash my face with cold water and pat dry with a towel. Also since the weather is getting warmer I will splash my face with cold water if I do start to feel oily. 

Exception: makeup for work &amp; social outings, frankly I think it's necessary, not only to keep my job but to be able to interact with people. But as soon as I get home I will wash it off. 


*Please feel free to ask questions or give me suggestions along my journey*


**Day 1**: Packed all my skin products away. It's odd, the long amount of time I usually spend on my face routine to be diminished into less than two minutes. Skin felt tighter? Also getting used to face breathing without moisturizer. 

**Day 2**: Skin is noticeably smoother and less redness. A few very tiny whiteheads appeared but no other signs of other major breakouts. Honestly I was afraid I would wake up with a huge breakout. 

**Day 3**: Record breaking 83 degrees in the early spring here. Had to splash my face multiple times with water due to AC not working. Skin has no signs of new breakouts. Previous whiteheads flattened. Starting to notice little amounts of dead skin building up. Skin actually feels supple? Ignoring the temptation to apply moisturizer or toner. 

**Day 4**: Three new bumps surfaced they look less irritated as they usually would, my skin appears calmer.. Also face was a bit oily but more of dewy. Skin feels softer as well. The dead skin I had from yesterday seemed to have slothed off with the natural oils on my face that accumulated today. The bumps also look more to the surface than a deep bump. Very tempted to pick at them :p Overall I'm pleased. I have read from previous people that this regime may make your skin break out first then ""reset"" 

**Day 5**: Today isnt so great few tiny bumps have surfaced  I think my face is hitting the purging point in this process.  My skin still feels naturally moisturized but not overbearingly oily. Although my skin texture feels nice I'm a bit sad with the new breakouts. Still keeping my hopes up.

Sorry for delay it's the weekend.

**Day 6-7** : No new bumps or signs of breakouts. Seems like previous bumps are healing faster than they normally would before this regime .Definitely notice face is less red. Although I'm not clear I'm liking that my face isn't irritated.
 
I decided I will contine this regimen past 10 days. My face seems to enjoy that there's no products on it also seems as effective as with products except again face isn't red skin feels soft. Will post pictures very soon.
Also sorry if my posts somehow end up jumbled. I edit and make daily updates on my phone in bed right before I go to sleep. Sleepy time~

**Day 8-9**: hoo boy~ my face is itchy and dry in some spots. Been drinking lots of water. Previous bumps have come to the surface to the point that any slight pressure will definitely release them. Been real good with not touching them. So turnover of bumps are definitely shorter as before it would take a week. 

I've also made the effort to tie my hair back away from my face before I go to bed. I notice my face looks nicer in the morning. 

Here are updated pictures day 9 into this : [1a](http://imgur.com/NWXGebZ) [1b](http://imgur.com/0KfGFSq)

**Day 10-11**: So my face is dry in the morning then starts to get oily throughout the day. If only I could just splash my face at work without messing up my mascara :P As of now half of my face is smooth while the other half has a few bumps I'm thinking they're hormonal because it's about that time of the month. That or my face haates when I use coverup. Face is still incredibly itchy I'm guessing cause of deadskin. I'm really liking this regime cause my face doesn't have that tight feeling from all the strong products. I'm considering using something natural to lighten my acne marks, but I guess I'll wait til im fully clear.

* A more structured, informative list of topicals with information laid out in a consistent manner, and hopefully more products included.
* Some discussion of alternative treatments, common myths or suggestions, and other things I might have left out of the previous guide. (I was originally working on this as an appendix to the guide, but never got it finished, so hopefully much of what I've done already will be usable.)

**My skin:**  I had a moderate case of surface acne on my face.  By November, I had about 30 bad pimples (big red ones that oozed pus and stuck around for weeks) and countless more mini-ones, as well as pin head-sized cysts all over my cheeks.  I was also having that weird problem in which my skin was really really oily, but also so dry that it was flaking off. 

**My (previous) regimen:**  I was washing my face in the morning with a salicylic acid soap, and finishing the day with Stridex pads (salicylic acid wipes).  I'd been using the soap for years, combined with the pads during breakouts.  

**The dermatologist:**  I went to a dermatologist in early November.  She said that women in their mid-20's often go through hormonal changes that cause them to develop acne.  She asked me nothing about what I'd tried, what type of skin I have, etc.  She prescribed an antibiotic face wash and sent me home with a bunch of soap and lotion samples.  By her rules, I would need to wash my face about four times a day.  

**What I actually did:**  

I thought about the evidence.  I have extremely sensitive, pale skin, and I easily get boils from things like shaving.  I had also kind of changed my eating habits during the summer.  This led me to believe that my problem was both inflammatory and dietary.

* I almost completely stopped washing my face with soap.  I didn't fill my prescription for the antibiotic soap, and I stopped using salicylic acid altogether.  I started out by just using water to wash myself when my face was oily.  The change was evident in a few days: my skin stopped flaking off and over-producing oil.  It no longer felt irritated all the time.  Now I wash once in the morning with CeraVe foaming cleanser, and once in the evening with water.  If I am feeling too dry, I skip the soap and just use water.  I think this bullet-point is the most important.  Agitating your skin constantly with different detergents and drying agents *causes more acne*.    

* I stopped touching my face.  No more picking, period.  No more resting my cheek on my hands.

* I washed my pillowcases and towels almost every time I used them, and with unscented laundry detergent.

* I started taking a multivitamin, but it made me throw up.  So I cut out almost all processed sugar from my diet (I still cheat with mayonnaise and sriracha), and bought a bunch of orange stuff: carrots and sweet potatoes.  I have no idea if this helped, but I wanted to get a lot of vitamin A.  At this point, I am pretty much on the [paleo diet](http://www.reddit.com/r/paleo).  I think getting my vitamins through food has definitely helped, but not as much as doing away with harsh soaps.

It has been a month and a half now, and I finally *have no acne*.  Not even one active zit.",,False,,t5_2qse3,1358271351.0,,,True,t3_16mlfg,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/16mlfg/what_worked_for_me/,

My face looks great after about 2 weeks!

- get an aloe plant or two ($3.99 each)
- cut off a 4-5 inch ""branch""
- refrigerate it before use! 
- rub on face twice a day, it will make your face initially very red so avoid going out

I first started developing acne when I was 11. At first it was very mild and restricted to my nose. It was just the occasional whitehead, which didn't bother me in the slightest. Over the years it progressively got worse until it became moderately severe in my mid teens. It was at this stage that it started bothering me, however I assumed it would just go away and didn't bother doing anything about it. Eventually it got to the stage where I decided I really needed to do something about it. I first started with over the counters products such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide but these did nothing for me. They barely even dried my skin out. My acne continued to get worse and I was eventually prescribed antiobiotics by my GP, which also had no effect whatsoever. My acne just kept getting worse. By the time I was 17 my skin was so oily that it made  my fringe hair constantly appear wet. By this stage I had severe cystic acne, with some of the cysts being more than a centimetre in diameter and lasting for months. I lacked so much confidence that I couldn't look people in the eyes and I would remove my glasses whenever I had to look in the mirror. I would dread having to get my photo taken. Getting the courage to talk to ~~girls~~ people was almost impossible. At times I considered just ending it all. It would have made things a lot easier. Finally, I decided to get a referral to a dermatologist who prescribed me my first course of accutane. I had been told that accutane was a miracle drug and my acne would be cured. I endured the side effects, which fortunately for me were mild, and saw my skin clear completely over the course of a few months. But it was only short lived. Within a few months my acne was back worse than ever. Over the next few years I went on two more courses of accutane, with the last one being almost two years ago. As more time passed the red marks faded, although not completely, and after nearly two years my skin began to almost look normal. I had slowly regained some of my confidence, but by no means all of it. Then, about 4 months ago my acne returned once again. Tomorrow I will be starting my fourth course of accutane in 6 years. Being an almost 24 year old man I am starting to lose hope that I will get over acne with age. I have tried almost every medication I know of, diets, cutting out alcohol, washing my face religiously, not washing my face at all, drinking lots of water, changing my pillow every day, exercising regularly, not exercising and who knows how many other things which I can't remember off the top of my head, with accutane being the only thing that has had *any* noticeable effect on my acne, although it was short lived.

I cut out all dairy from my diet. Milk, cheese, yogurt, etc. In addition to the diet change, I continued to wash my face in the morning/before bed, and drink water. Due to that one dietary change, my face has completely cleared up. At the moment I'm only dealing with healing of  past acne scars, but since the change I've been acne free for months.

I've even tested this theory by indulging myself in dairy for a day every now and then, and it just so happens that as a result I break out a few days later. Coincidence? I think not!

I've had acne around my chin and neck area since starting college. I did a bunch of research online and found out that this is likely due to hormones (I'm a dude). I've been taking antibiotics for a couple years and using benzoyl peroxide, but that didn't seem to help much. The biggest change in my skin clarity came with my diet. Here's what I changed:
-no dairy
-minimal simple carbohydrates (white bread, spaghetti, etc.)
-minimal red meat
-eat more fruits and veggies (some with every meal)
-eat complex carbs
-drink a ton of water

Since making these changes my skin has started to appear much better, and I rarely get cysts. It has done wonders in improving my self esteem, and being able to look in the mirror.

However, today, as I was wiping after taking a poop, I noticed blood on the toilet paper. I checked to make sure it wasn't hemmorhoids (it wasn't) so I think it's because my butthole is very dry.

Day 13's photo was taken in a different room in a different apartment, so I'm sorry that the lighting and everything is different :/ I tried to get it pretty close but failed.

From Day 6 - 11 I had my period and my face was ransacked by evil acne creating demons.  The area around my mouth broke out like what usually happens and I had 2 new zits above my right eyebrow.  Probably because I got bangs recently and have been touching them a whole bunch - ugh!

Right now I am using sunflower seed oil to cleanse at night. It's awesome at taking off my makeup and making me feel moisturized.  In the morning I cleanse with Simple brand gentle face wash to get off the oil from the night and the oil from cleansing (tends to get in the way of putting on my make up - make up won't stick as well :/ )

I'm pretty sure the breakout that I got was from my period/pms/anxiety and not the oil, but I could be wrong.  I'm going ahead with the oil cleansing unless it gets worse within the next two weeks, in which case I would stop.

Any words of advice or help at anything I'm doing wrong or right? I'm slightly leary about this whole process and I hope it works out :/

I have oily skin and most of my acne was along my jawline and the corners of my mouth, with bits and pieces everywhere else.

Basically I've been experimenting with my diet and different vitamins for 2 years or so and I've finally one the battle (provided it doesn't come back!) and I feel selfish for not trying to help others.

Vitamins that made a difference -

* B5 - Everyone seems to think this is some sort of miracle cure, but it's not. At one point I'd take about 5g a day and my skin seemed to be getting better apart from getting really dry and a bit flaky, but one day I got pretty badly suburnt and the redness lasted for **months**. I still take it, but only .5g twice a day.

* Fish oil made a huge difference, there's alot of scare around it though once you balance out your omega 6:3 ratio, you'll notice a huge decrease in inflamation. 

* chromium picolinate, google the testimonies online, it has great results

* Alpha Lipoic Acid and Selenium. These 2 are both free radical scavengers and anit-oxidants, they also make your skin heal faster after getting a cyst etc.

* the final and most important supplment is! http://www.herbsofgold.com.au/products/product/1577
after about a month on this I didn't really get any new blemishes, just 1 or 2 if I ever had a cheat meal.

Diet - I'm certain that diet is paramount when it comes to skin quality, basically I went on a very strict elimination diet to see what foods were triggers 

* Diary - I've always had an allergy to whey and cassien protein, but I never really cut it out 100%, now that I have my skin (and general health) has improved greatly

* Gluten - Turns out I have celiac disease (lol) but once I cut this out, I did feel alot better and my skin improved.

* Citrus fruits. So many people will argue that it's impossible for fruits to have a negative effect but at one stage I was drinking loads of lemon water to treat water retention and I broke out with acne to the sides of my mouth. I did another trial and test with it, then googled around to see if anyone else had a similar reaction, so then I came to the conclusion that citrus is not for me.

* shitty foods and caffeine. Pretty obvious, they put huge stress on the adrenal glands, I swapped my coffes for licorice tea and really cleaned up my diet.


Overall it wasn't just one of these diet changes/minerals that cleared my skin but the combination of them all. I'm pretty ecstatic about my progress and I apologise for the wall of text and lack of proof reading.

1330417174.0,13,self.acne,q9h14,First step for getting rid of Adult acne is changing your diet and exercising --Self experience,nerdz_princess,15,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/q9h14/first_step_for_getting_rid_of_adult_acne_is/,"OK this is a long post. If you don't have time or patience, just read the 6 points below.

I have always suffered with moderately severe acne from when I was teenager. They had subsided for some time between 21 to 23 years. But from past 1 year it started increasing and making my face look real ugly. During teenage at-least the acne scars used to fade away real quick, but now the acne scars seem to never go. I went to the same dermat whose prescription had helped me to clear out teenage acne, but it did not seem to help much now.

After doing a lot of research on net I found out that hormones play a major role in causing acne. I wanted to meet a endocrinologist but they did not seem to be found anywhere near my place, so i decided to meet a gynecologist. She asked me some questions and did an ultrasound and told me that I have got the scary PCOS!! and gave three medicines to take. I got real scared after googling about PCOS and the medicines she had given. I did not show any symptom of PCOS other than mild acne and poly-cystic ovaries. I had never skipped my periods. I am not overweight, dont have skin tags or  hirsutism. Also I have already lost 3 KGS in 3 weeks. So I did not want to take the tablets she prescribed. She also told me scary things like you'll become very fat in 6 months due to PCOS. She asked me to conceive asap, etc.

I wanted to get a second opinion. The second gynac was suggested by my mom's friend. She told me that she is the best gynac in my city. I went and met her and she just said ""Don't worry, this is common. You need to visit a gynac only when you skip your periods for more than 2 months! or when you are not able to conceive"". She said ""Just exercise and eat healthy. Everything will be fine!"" I did take her advice to exercise and eat healthy. At the same time I knew that the problem is not so simple or so complicated as both the docs think it is.

So I started keeping a watch on what I eat and starting doing some sort sort of exercise for 30 mins everyday. I have noticed a considerable change in my face acne in just three weeks. I am left with only 1 acne pimple now, but the marks are still there! :( I will go to a dermat to get rid of them.

So this is what I am following:

1. Cutting down on white sugar. I am now adding small amount of brown sugar to my tea.

2. Avoiding sweets and oily food. If I do get tempted I eat a little of it like half a piece of sweet, or very small portions (4 to 5 pieces) of fried stuff.

3. Drinking lots of water.

4. Including lots of fresh vegetables and fruits in my diet.

5. Eating some mint leaves. Spearmint is supposed to lower androgen levels which may be causing acne. I am not sure if the mint found here is spearmint.Also, I eat fenugreek leaves everyday and one or two cloves of garlic (supposed to regulate periods, but I don't want to eat too much). Also half a teaspoon of sesame seeds (good source of zinc can reduce acne) and boiled egg white and around 100 ml milk (for vit B12 as I am a Lacto-ovo-vegetarian).

6. Doing some kind of exercise for 30 mins everyday. I usually go to yoga class or gym at my office but if I am not able to go, I do aerobics at home watching Fat Burning Workout video posted by Gilad on Youtube.
Results seen in three weeks: Lost three kgs and reducing the acne on my face from 7 to just 1.

I wanted to share my experience so that others can benefit from my findings. Also, if you have any tips/suggestions of your own, please share it here.

Thanks for reading!

1321855058.0,13,self.acne,mjv3e,This is what I did to control my Acne. ,MonCoeur,16,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/mjv3e/this_is_what_i_did_to_control_my_acne/,"As with most of you, I have had acne for YEARS that I couldn't seem to get rid of. I swear that I've tried just about every over the counter/home remedy/prescription (barring Accutaine) acne everything out there to no avail. I had very painful cystic acne, black and white heads. I had about given up hope, but I started talking to the owner of a small beauty supply store and she gave me a number of samples to try. After about a month of trying a few things, I found that my face had drastically improved in severity of acne, frequency, and over all texture. Here is a list of the things that I have found to be the best for my oily/combination skin. This worked for me and I couldn't be happier. I hope that this helps others, and even if it doesn't, don't give up!

Wash your face every morning and night with NO exceptions. This is going to be the thing that really helps. I used to wash my face only once a day because the cystic acne was so painful. All of the products that I'm using are mild and nonirritating, so washing isn't painful anymore.  

1. Face Wash: [Epicurean Clarify Cleanser] (http://www.amazon.com/Epicuren-Clarify-Cleanser/dp/B001R1NXOQ/ref=pd_sim_bt_6)- This wash is gentle yet strong enough to get deep in your pores to really clean your face. My skin feels soft and smooth after washing and never dry or tight. I did notice that my skin felt a little rough for the first week or so of use, but I imagine that my skin was just getting used to the new product.

2. Toner: [Cucumber Cleansing Lotion] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/cucumber-cleansing-lotion) or [Special Cucumber Lotion] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/special-cucumber-lotion) - I meant to get the special cucumber lotion, but accidentally grabbed the Cucumber lotion. Both are suitable for combination/oily skin, though the special lotion is specifically for acne prone skin. These are toners despite lotion in the name. After much research I decided to add toner into my regime to help tighten my pores and make sure all dirt was cleared away. This toner doesn't make my face sting or feel tight or dry.

3. Acne treatment: [Buffering Lotion] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/buffering-lotion) - Again this isn't a lotion, but a deep penetrating anti-inflammatory treatment for cystic acne. I put this on my problem areas day and night. It is the ONLY thing I've found that has virtually wiped out all traces of my cystic acne. It also seems to work on other kinds of acne, thought it is sold as a treatment for cystic acne.

4. Moisturizer: **Night** - [Epicuren Facial Emulsion] (http://www.amazon.com/Epicuren-Facial-Emulsion-2-oz/dp/B000ULI3Y4/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321853618&amp;sr=1-3) - For many years I didn't use moisturizer because my face gets so oily, but my face was producing so much oil because I kept removing it! This moisturizer goes on light, absorbs quickly and completely. There is NO oily feel whatsoever and my skin feels soft. I like this lotion so much, that I've started using it in the morning too. 
**Day** - [Oil Free Moisturizer] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/oil-free-moisturizer-spf-17) - USE SUNSCREEN! Will help keep skin healthy and cancer free. Even though a nice tan helps cover my acne scarring, I would rather not have freckles. Since I use the other lotion night and day now, I use an oil free SPF moisturizer so I don't feel like I have one more thing to add to clogged pores.

5. Exfoliation: About 2 or 3 times  week I use an exfoliating scrub [Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub] (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Daily-Scrub-Ounce/dp/B000NWDSAE/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321892233&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0)  or a mixture of 3 parts baking soda/1 part water to help clear away dead skin. Don't do this until your acne is almost completely gone. A scrub on erupted skin will be painful and can spread bacteria and make things worse.     

Remember that it can take up to a month to start seeing results with any new acne treatment. I started seeing clearer skin after a week and by the end of the first month, almost completely clear! I still get the occasional pimple, but my skin has not looked this good since I was a child. The best part is that there isn't any cystic acne and the few pimples I have gotten in the past 4 months, are pain free!! Now I just need to find a good product to fade the acne scars.

Let me know if you have any questions!

However, i think I have hit rock bottom.  I literally cannot take it anymore.

I've always had acne.  I started getting blemishes in the fifth grade when I got my period (I am 20 years old now).  My acne has never fully gone away but it has always been tolerable.  Lets face it there are children dying of cancer; I can live with a few pimples on my face/ back.  I was always able to control breakouts with either proactive, the pill, antibiotics, and prescription lotions.  I absolutely love my dermatologist and has always succeeded in clearing up my breakouts.    

While I was at college this past winter I became extremely depressed.  At first I thought it may have been the hormones for my birth control making me moody so I stopped taking it.  My depression got so bad that I had to withdraw from school and come home.  Once at home I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder.  During this time I had a moderate breakout but it hardly bothered me compared to the other shit I was dealing with.  My psychiatrist prescribed me a mood stabilizer called lamictal.  

After being on this medicine for about 5 months my skin is unbearable.  I don't want to hang out with my friends or go out.  I don't want to sound over dramatic but the way I look right now is dragging me back into the black hole of depression - A place I never want to be again.  I've posted on r/bipolar asking if other women if they experienced breakouts from taking lamictal - some said yes they had breakouts but not to the extent of mine.  They also said lamictal can mess with your hormones.  Right now my breakout is contained to my jawline and neck however it is slowly spreading towards my mouth and cheeks.  I know that acne on the jawline/ neck is usually caused my hormones.  SO do you think the culprit of my breakout is the lamictal???

Currently I am back on the pill.  I've been to my dermatologist 4 times in the past 3 months.  I have another appointment in 3 weeks.  I've been on two different antibiotics.  I am taking the stronger of the two twice a day right now (I've been on it for two weeks and have seen no change).  I am using two different prescription lotions - one in the morning one at night.  I changed my shampoo to a non residue (a suggestion I saw on here)  I use aveeno clear complexion cream cleanser to wash my face.  I don't go tanning.  I don't smoke.  I wash my pillow cases weekly (not that it matters because I sleep on my back).  I make a conscious effort not to touch my face.  I eat healthy AND I am chugging water like it is my job.  

I honestly do not know what to do.  I don't know if you guys can even give me any advice since I think I covered basically everything.  SO basically I'm asking for some support.  Please give me the silver lining I need.

I've had acne for about as long as I can remember. I'm 24, and I've had mild, but *very* consistent acne for at least the past eight years. It's always been concentrated around my mouth area - above the lips, below the lips, to the side of the lips. As I'm sure you're aware, it deals a pretty significant blow to my self-esteem on a daily basis.

About a year ago (June 1st, 2012), I decided to move to Paris from Dallas, Texas. I just wanted to make a change and do something different, and, as it happens, I'm half-French and enjoy dual-nationality status. So I saved up and made the move. Now, here's where it gets strange...**two weeks** after moving to Paris, all the acne on my face disappeared. This is no hyperbole - the acne was GONE, basta, finished. For the rest of my time in Paris, I experienced life without acne. It was beautiful. Despite my incredibly shitty job, I could actually look at a girl without worrying about which direction my head was turned, or weather or not my fucking breakouts were under control. I was liberated. On top of that, my diet, drinking, and smoking habits were worse than they've ever been - I smoked almost a pack a day, usually drank a bottle of wine a day, and ate meat, cheese, and milk in great excess. But...no acne.

Unfortunately, I didn't find what I was looking for in that city. As beautiful as it was, I decided to say goodbye and move stateside, to NYC, on February 1st. I had been talking about the move to my friends on both sides of the pond, and I started to think about my acne. What if it came back upon my return to America? What if this incredible disappearance was just something about France, and that coming back to the states would cause it to return to the surface? I wasn't so surprised to find, then, that when I moved back in February, so did my acne. It's as if I never left. Only now, my eating and exercise habits are better than they've ever been. I'm working out 4 to 5 days a week, I eat greens and avoid grease as much as humanly possible, and I've replicated my face-washing regimen from my Paris days. But the acne's back in full-force, and it's fucking killing me. I look like a fucking child with this shit on my face.

Here's me in Paris, immediately before I left (no makeup): http://i.imgur.com/vzYtkKh.jpg

And here's my face now, about three months into NYC (no makeup...obviously): http://i.imgur.com/th6e3wc.jpg

What the *fuck* happened? Does anyone know what it might have been? This is a mystery to anyone I bring it up to; they say it might be the air, the food, the water...all I wish is that I could be rid of this crap and not look like some sort of monstrosity. And it's all been made even worse by the fact that I've been allowed to experience life without acne - and it's everything I thought it would be. Fuck.

Help me, Reddit.

IT WORKED.  And fast too! So now that my plantar warts are gone and I still have almost a full bottle of apple cider vinegar I thought to myself ""why not this try this on my stubborn acne?""

edit for clarification on before after pics: green shirt is before..been using for 4 days. Gray shirt pic taken today. I have makeup on in pics mainly because I have a lot of hyperpigmentation so it's hard to discern what's a spot or a pimple. Used overhead light in bathroom so you can see where the raised areas are zits.

So, I have tried tons of OTC remedies to treat my acne over the course of my life. I'm currently on BC and doxycycline, which has done wonders for my skin, but I still get these little ""patches"" of acne that I can't seem to get rid of. My skin responds really well to anything acid based...but it's hypersensitive and dries out super easily. So, although things like glycolic, azealic and salicylic acid work well for me...it leaves me with dry, flaky skin.

SO...I was at CVS the other day and I remembered when I was younger my mom used to use Kerasol all the time for her dry, cracked feet...and that it also has ingredients to promote cell turnover and moisturize the skin. So I looked it up.

Here are the active ingredients in Kerasal:

Salicylic acid 5%

Urea: 10% (Sounds gross, but this ingredient is from urine...this is the acid part that promotes cell turnover. It's not urine itself, just the acid)

White petroleum

So far it's only been a couple of days but I can already tell my skin is benefiting from the acids but not drying out, which is huge for me at least.

Has anyone else ever tried anything like this and experienced positive results? I can't find a single thing about it on the internet.

Oh..this is my routine:
1) Wash with castor oil and a clean cloth
2) Pat dry face and rub in kerasal until absorbed
3) Moisturize with castor oil and pat dry with cloth
4) Apply pea size amount of Monistat Anti-Chafing Gel (I know, again weird product..but this stuff if pretty great too) for a silky moisture barrier.

Sometimes I'll still use the salicylic acid toner after I wash, but for now I've just been sticking to the kerasal.

Like most people here I suspect, I have tried just about everything to rid my face of my persistent acne. I have been using tidbits from this subreddit for a few months(clean pillowcases/towels/eating healthy/exercise) to no avail, until I stumbled on a real gem about the OCM with only a few upvotes. I then tried out a personal mixture of OCM (which I will describe in depth) about 5 weeks ago and have been super excited about the results.

I bought high heat sunflower seed oil from a grocery store nearby, castor oil from the laxative section of walgreens, as well as tea tree oil from the vitamin section of walgreens. Before bed each day for the past five weeks, I have been mixing 20% or less castor oil into 75% sunflower seed oil, and 5% tea tree oil all into a shot glass(only to about 1/4 to 1/2 of the way up), and applying it liberally to the face. After washing my face with some warm water, drying it, and applying the oil, I use a hot washcloth over the face to really antagonize the pores into letting the oils seep deeper down. Of course you can always look up videos of this like the one that helped me figure it out:(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqKkinvvvoAI) 

I have only been washing with water, using no moisturizer, and shaving every other day. I can report that I am 100%, besides some persistant old blackheads, acne free, and it feels wonderful. I also bought some new castor oil that is cold pressed from a vitamin website based off of some of the recommendations I have read on other forums. 

I hope this helps at least one other person out there, I know it was the best decision I have made in regards to my skin. Stay classy!

I'm a 20 y/o male who has suffered mild facial acne since 8th grade and harsh skin conditions on the back of my head since middle school. 

Contributing factors to my condition:
I would consistently touch my face and scratch the back of my head. I would press around bumps with my finger nail to coax black heads (probably weren't black heads but I'm not sure of the appropriate terminology) out, which in turn opened wounds to greasy hair. 

It had gotten so bad I had tiny bald spots ALL over my upper neck region. Large cyst-like bumps would grow and result in bald spots.

The fix:
I developed a habit of not touching my left cheek and after a couple months noticed an extreme difference and that inspired me to really do my best to pull out all stops (short of medication) to assist myself in having clear skin.

Steps:
Fresh towel EVERY night on my pillow.

Never touch any part of my head or neck with my palms. If there were any bumps which began to get a white head to them, I'd wait til after a shower and gently press around it, and if there wasn't any INSTANT success, I would just let it be until next time.

Regular sleep schedule. I know naturally wake up at 7:27, three minutes before my alarm clock. I forced myself to get the most out of my day and start doing stuff in the morning.

Extremely low carb diet and regular exercise, combined with LOTS OF WATER AND LOTS OF ORANGE JUICE. Being sick would bring it out my acne, so I did my best to be healthy. My diet consisted of chicken, four apples a day, and carrots. At breakfast I'd have a bagel and eggs. I don't contribute my strict diet to my success necessarily, but I believe determination with zero cheating and zero simple sugars had excellent benefits.

MY NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF SUCCESS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE MY BIGGEST CONTRIBUTION:

Short showers.

I was taking 20 to 45+ minute showers. I would stand there with the back of my head to scalding hot water for ten minute stretches while I thought about life. My shoulders and back of my head had the worst acne damage. 

I now take 15 minute showers MAX. I bring a watch with me to go as fast as possible. I'll take them before I have to do something to force myself to rush. I was weakening my skin by soaking for too long. I end with thirty seconds of cold water before I step out, as well.

I saw FANTASTIC results within a month, and while my face wasn't ""terrible"", I still managed to look prepubescent with the scarring on my face (which is going away now as well).

The back of my head is another story. I'm not quite sure what to do about it besides sticking to the plan. My bald spots are beginning to disappear, but I'm positive I've done some permanent damage.

So basically, I had zero acne in high school, it began in college, and got increasingly worse. This summer was absolutely the worst in my life (pics below). Throwaway account because it was so awful I have trouble talking about it. I don't want to bore you with backstory because I want to share how exactly I somehow managed to ""cure"" my acne 95%.

Basically, my main problem was always occasional cystic, hormonal acne that I would pick the shit out of and then would always turn out to be awful scabs on my face. I never had acne on my cheeks until the beginning of this summer. My cheeks broke out horribly and continued to get worse and worse. I caked my face in benzoyl peroxide every night (which I'm sure contributed to the problem).

I was a social recluse all summer and it was only towards the end that it began to clear up.

Here are the factors that may or may not have contributed:

1. I quit working at a greasy, diner type restaurant

2. I made a conscious effort to stop picking my skin

3. A coworker suggested Pronexin to me. The website seems SUPER scammy, but I tried it and it was truly what I owe to clearing me up. I had spent hundreds of dollars on products up to this point. At that point I was using Pronexin and nothing else (not even moisturizer) until I was 95% clear of active acne.

Then, I was stuck with AWFUL, AWFUL scars that looked almost even worse than the acne itself. I dealt with it and caked on make up during the school semester, afraid to try anything new because I could not handle breaking out again. Eventually, I incorporated back in a daily moisturizer (Mario Badescu Aloe Moisturizer)

Now, if you've made it this far, THIS IS WHAT'S WORKING WONDERS FOR MY RED MARKS! I have learned that harsh products are NOT the solution. Gentle is the way to go! Through trial and error, lots of money/products/etc wasted, this is what is working for me.

Night

1. Take off make up, wash with Pronexin at night

2. MANUKA HONEY MASK!!! 30 min to 1hr. Active 20+. Has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and lightening properties. Somewhat expensive, but a miracle worker.

3. Tone with 50% ACV, 50% Water

4. Pat on Rosehip Oil to moisturize (Only use if your acne is cleared up, google it to see all of the great benefits for acne scars)

5. Occasionally, I'll layer on Mederma or a dark spot corrector but not every night because they are not natural products and I don't trust them on my skin

In the morning, I just use Pronexin, tone with witch hazel (cause ACV stinks), and use the Mario Badescu moisturizer.

Supplements:

Source of Life vitamins (expensive, but THE BEST)

Cod Liver Oil (experimenting with this one)

Probiotics!!! (I switch it up every two months or so because your body gets used to strains)

So far, this seems to be working beautifully. I have made a lot of progress from where I was 3 months ago, but as you can see from the after picture, there is still some dark marks to go. However, my skin is the type to flip at the switch and I hope to never, ever, be back at the place I was this summer.

The front page post talks about a guy whose cause of acne is dairy and explains a story behind it. Well, currently I go to college about 1.5 hrs away from my home. At home I would consume about 2 gallons of milk a week by myself, and sometimes a brick of cheese alone (I love cheese and crackers). During this time I was always on acne medication. I was on accutane four times, countless topicals and 5-6 different other oral medications since I have been 15 (I'm 21 now). During the time the only medication that completely got rid of my acne was accutane...but when I came off of it, the acne always came back...after the fourth time taking it, I was able to take a different oral medication that could keep it under control. Now being in my senior year of college and living off campus, I make my own food, but to save money....I eat like a poor college student. Pretty much no milk, and no cheese, and about a third through the semester I ran out of my prescription and never got it filled. I don't know why just too lazy I guess, and I hate taking medication. To my surprise, I didn't break out. At first I thought there was residual medication in my system, but even after 2 months I still did not break out. Like I said I maybe had a glass of milk once a week, and was eating very minimal cheese, pretty much only parmesan cheese on pasta. At this point I did not know that dairy was the cause of my acne. When I was about to leave for Christmas Break to come home, I found this subreddit and went to the top of all time and found the post about dairy causing acne. I put two and two together and when I got home decided to test to see if dairy could cause my acne. I went straight back to my old eating habits.....tons of milk and cheese. After about a week...I broke out again. It was small at first and then became very sensitive, red and irritated. So fortunately I found the cause of my acne, but I can't eat my favorite stuff like I used to. Oh well everything in moderation I suppose. Hahah. I just wanted to share my story with people and let people know that dairy can cause acne. Thanks for reading.

This is what I look like right now: http://imgur.com/a/TTJvH 

Warning: I look terrible. 

So, let me just start by saying that I come to r/acne in desperate need of advice. I simply do not know what to do.

I've had acne since the fifth grade. I must have been nine or ten years old when my first zit developed right smack in the middle of my nose. Fast forward ten years later, and I'm still suffering from this dreadful affliction. 

I've been to the dermatologist numerous times, and have been put on numerous regimens, all of which have failed. The only reason I go now are for cortisone shots, as they help reduce the deep cysts that I constantly get. Though I have noticed and felt, at least one day after receiving the shots, that more cysts were developing on other parts of my face. This has happened on many occasions. :|

As for my lifestyle: I exercise regularly, drink plenty of water (2-4 bottles every single day), have been a vegetarian for several years now (I have completely cut off all meat and fish from my diet), drink only soy milk, have lost a healthy amount of weight as a result, and I generally have a positive outlook on life...though this is quickly becoming jaded thanks to my acne. The only reason I ever get depressed is because of new breakouts or the like. 

My current regimen:

-Two 100mg minocycline capsules every day (have been put on doxycycline and oxytetracycline in the past)

-Erythromycin Topical Solution USP, 2%, twice daily 

-Atralin (to help reduce the scars left from past break outs), every night

-Biafine to help moisturize since it's the only thing that can keep my skin from drying up too quickly. 

-I also shower with a 5% benzol peroxide facial wash that I apply twice daily. It's called ""Clean and Clear Advantage 3-in-1 exfoliating cleanser"".  

When it's all said and done, I try to cover up with Rezamid if this is during the morning, but that hasn't been working lately. Frankly, all it does it make people realize that I have to apply make up every day as a 20 year old male. Whoopee. 

I honestly had much more typed out, but it honestly that seemed like a huge waste of time. Simply put, NOTHING has worked. I don't have much hope for my current regimen which I started this past weekend, either. I'm just extremely upset that, after ten years, I still have to cater my mornings to making sure I can cover up my acne as best as I can. 

I want to be a physician and have hopes of going to medical school once I finish college, and though I have no interest in Dermatology (thank you, acne), it just sucks to know that I probably wouldn't have a shot in the field because of how bad MY acne is. I mean, how would you feel, as a patient, if you had a Dermatologist with acne like me? 

I want to start Accutane. I really do. Given what my acne currently looks like in addition to the fact that it's most likely stubborn bacterial acne (which, thanks to antibiotic resistance, will most likely not go away despite my taking minocycline), would I be a sufficient candidate for Accutane?",,False,,t5_2qse3,1350954672.0,,,True,t3_11x041,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/11x041/20m_suffered_with_acne_since_the_fifth_grade_im/,

So, it's been a while since I wrote [The Redditor's Guide to Acne](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/nrkg2/the_redditors_guide_to_acne_version_2/). I've largely moved away from researching and writing about acne this year and into other interests (and it helps that my acne is down to maybe a couple of pimples a week which I still can't explain), so I haven't been keeping up with the posts here, even though I can see there's been a lot of stuff I should have been around for.

I know that guide needs to be updated, there are plenty of things that I think could be done with it by now. I was also working on an addendum that would cover lots of miscellaneous/obscure/experimental topics that I didn't get around to in the FAQ, and I should still have that around somewhere, so I'd like to finish that. I might post some parts that I had already done (at least partly) here, if there's some interest. Some of the sections included more detail on vitamins/supplements, and on various homemade and natural remedies. Many of these were left out simply because they were ones I think you should *not* use, but I realise that's actually not a good enough reason to not explain them, especially if I want to caution against certain things. I also wanted to look at some things that are interesting, but currently lack evidence - especially if anyone here has tried them or is willing to try them.

That requires both time and motivation, which I haven't had for a while. Hopefully by posting here again, I might get some of it back. For now, I'd like to use this topic to answer anything you want to know that isn't covered by the guide, or any questions you have about what is in the guide, or any general ideas/suggestions people have.

1346459743.0,12,self.acne,z5wy3,"Pantothenic acid (AKA vitamin B5) megadoses - my story, and a guide to if you want to try yourself",Hazelrat10,13,1,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/z5wy3/pantothenic_acid_aka_vitamin_b5_megadoses_my/,"**I'm going to label my paragraphs so you can skip over whatever you don't find interesting/don't need to hear.**

I am avoiding accutane at all costs. After oral antibiotics and topical retin-a cream, my acne has really only slowed down (and also has a fairly long healing process). And so I have cut the oral antibiotics and switched to megadosing pantothenic acid (10 grams a day) along with 60 mg of zinc a day.

My story-

The first couple days I broke out, and I believe that's because the oral antibiotics were slowing down the appearance of acne. Whenever I missed a day I could count on seeing acne the next day. However, I think the B5 has managed to do a good job of being a healthy replacement to the minocycline and acne has stopped appearing, I also have a much less oily face (it is sometimes dry, I've been finding I need more moisturizer now). That being said my **main problem** is that I have deep red marks where acne use to be, which are concentrated along my chin and forehead. I am happy to say that these have begun to fade after only 4 days of megadosing B5 and moderate amounts of zinc per day (I am not sure which one to thank for that, but I'm fairly sure this is also thanks to the B5). 

The theory-

If anyone is curious about trying this method, here is Dr. Leung's study of pantothenic acid, its relations to Coenzyme A, and CoA's relations to acne http://www.coenzyme-a.com/acne_vulgaris.html (I do not recommend you purchase anything off that site, it is quite overpriced). I will, however, summarize: CoA (which is *very* important to the body) is involved in many reactions, which include the production of sex hormones and fatty acid metabolism. For teenagers (like myself), both male and female, our bodies are producing higher amounts of sex hormones than adults and thus require more CoA. That is not to say that this treatment won't work for adults, it is simply that acne is more common in teenagers because hormone production is higher. A deficiency of CoA is caused by a deficiency in the things necessary to create CoA, which is mostly pantothenic acid (the body can produce the other ingredients by itself). This deficiency results in the body prioritizing what it uses CoA for, which is *always* hormone production. The excess fatty acids then, that have not been metabolized, end up causing more oils to be secreted onto your face, making acne much more likely to occur. If you think this sounds crazy, keep in mind research has shown that males that have had their testicles removed (ouch) before they were teenagers rarely show acne, which is theorized to be because they aren't producing as much testosterone and thus require far less CoA.

Should you decide to join me-

Get pantothenic acid supplements, and ***lots*** of them. Start out with at least 200 supplements and *try* to get them as 500 mg each. You may be deterred that supplements can be expensive, I recommend you get rugby laboratories brand pantothenic acid from a walgreens pharmacy. It's $5 per bottle and has 100 pills 500 mg each (natural supplements are not more effective than synthesized supplements, by dad is a biologist and actually did a study on this). Take 5 of these per session roughly 3 hours apart (doesn't matter if it's with food or not), which is 2.5 grams per session. You'll want to total 10 grams per day, so just figure out a daily schedule (it doesn't have to be exactly 3 hours apart, just try not to take them closer than 2 hours otherwise your body won't absorb as much). If your acne disappears entirely, you'll want to go to a ""maintenance"" dosage of about 4-5 grams a day or less if problematic side effects occur (basically just don't take 10 grams a day for over 6 months, it should be obvious by then whether or not this will help).

IMPORTANT THINGS/SIDE EFFECTS-

Drink water. Buckets of it. Drinking water in itself is good for fighting acne, but you will need lots of water if you follow this as large amounts of any vitamin isn't the best for your kidneys. 3 liters a day is a good goal to have, but don't go crazy and drink 2 liters in one sitting. This is all about spreading out the dosage so your body can work with this over time. B5 usually causes a decreased appetite along with an increased metabolism, expect to lose some weight (don't expect this to be a good weight loss program though). Also, do not take B5 at the same time as a multivitamin or any other supplement you're currently taking, too many vitamins in your system can block absorption (certain vitamins also compete against each other). As vitamin B5 is a water soluble vitamin, you will not have to worry about reaching toxic amounts in your system. That being said, I still do not recommend you go over 10 grams, 12 grams max. The more you take, the more strain it is on your kidneys. Do not exceed 5 grams in one hour. Side effects are minimal, large amounts of B5 can be a stool softener (you'll have to poop more often). An interesting side effect is that I've had more dreams since beginning, and I think this is because vitamins tend to keep people awake if they're taken close to before they sleep. This results in lighter sleep and being more self aware in dreams, which has allowed me to remember my dreams (which I haven't been able to in years).

On Monday of last week while brushing my teeth before bed I had the idea that if mouthwash can kill bacteria in my mouth but still gentle enough not to harm my gums why not try it on my face? what was the worst that could happen? so I took my crest 3D mouthwash and put some on my hands and gently washed my face with it. Also I would use my night cream afterwords but only in my trouble spot.

I washed with the mouth wash the rest of the week twice daily in the morning and at night - after each time I used my night cream after but only in small amounts.

By Saturday I noticed a remarkable improvement! the redness in my skin is virtually gone, the flaky skin and burning feeling is gone, no white heads or boils, no oily shiny face and my pores are not as noticeable.

I continued using the 3D Mouth wash as cleanser all of this week  and I swear I have never had skin this clear in my entire life. the only thing it has no effect on is black heads.

Turns out those were smaller pieces of the larger puzzle. After more research (the best cure for acne is knowledge, in my opinion) I changed my hypothesis to a problem with my gut.

I've had some pretty strong antibiotics/steroids in the past (including vancomycin, one of the strongest out there) for a self-inflicted eye injury long ago. These antibiotics have likely wreaked untold havoc on my gut. A weakened gut can't digest properly, which requires more thorough mechanical digestion (my first post) and struggles with hard-to-digest wheat (my second post).

What have I done in response?

**Supplements:** I take two pills milk thistle (450mg) and two pills of New Chapter probiotic in the morning before breakfast. After breakfast, I take two pills of high-potency apple cider vinegar and two pills candida support.

**Skincare products:** Jojoba oil applied nightly with an overnight raw honey mask. In the mornings I either moisturize with jojoba oil or apply Scarzone sunscreen/moisturizer with jojoba oil mixed in. I sporadically use tea tree oil (75% tea tree oil, 25% vitamin E) as a spot treatment. I recommend to simplify this part since it's only a treatment of a symptom, not a cause.

Products and supplements are good and all, but they pale in importance to the following two:

**Habits:** For the love of all things holy - Do NOT pop or pick at your pimples. This includes the maneuver in which you pull the skin around the pimple away. It's just going to leave a red blotch and take for-freaking-ever to heal. I speak from nearly a decade of experience. Just don't touch your face at all. Itches? Tough it out.

Also, don't look in the mirror. You'll just be disappointed, on top of being tempted to mangle your face for misguided short-term gain. Our acne is always worst in our own eyes. Look down when brushing your teeth. Only look in the mirror when using skincare products. Don't be aggressive with your hands (freshly cleaned, I hope) when applying skincare products. That leads to irritation. Irritation = acne (thank you acne.org for that important lesson).

**Diet:** The big D. This is, without a doubt, the most important part of my recovery process. I've eliminated grains and starches from my main meals. I experimented with eating pizza and ice cream three days in a row last week. It wasn't pretty. Learn about glycemic load, and it relates to insulin. An under-mentioned culprit is sugary foods. Cut down on those too. I've eliminated most dairy, but I'm just now reintroducing cheese, provided that it's cooked and that it lacks certain hormones and chemicals. I'm enacting a rough approximation of the GAPS diet, aimed at letting your gut heal. I personally find the actual GAPS diet too restrictive for my comparative lack of symptoms. At any rate, my skin is slowly improving, so I'm obviously doing *something* right.

I have cheat days every now and then. I regulate this by only letting myself nutritionally off-road outside of my main meals (since I'm a working college student in the summertime, I'm cooking for myself. Yay budgets!). I avoid pizza and ice cream on principle, but aside from that I've done all right.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My skin tone has slowly started to even out (it's gonna take patience). The left side of my face just has a few small non-red pimples. The right side has a small collection of tiny, dried-up pimples on my lower cheek (near my mouth) which I presume will fade with time. That said **does anyone have advice for expediting the retreat of tiny, dried pimples?** I intend to be patient, but if there is a way I can expedite the healing process easily enough, I want to know more about it.

**TL;DR** I believe my acne has been caused by my gut, which has likely been weakened by antibiotics. Seeking advice on how to get tiny, dried pimples to heal faster. Advice on evening out skin tone would also help.",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_1gvmd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1gvmd9/the_biggerpicture_cause_of_my_acne_seeking_advice/,

What basically bothered me was that in sunlight, no matter how much makeup helped to cover the redness, you could still see the bumpy texture of my pimples and clogged pores, etc, etc.

Well... I had the idea to test the effects of changing my diet for 1 week on my skin. What I mainly ate for this week included:

-boiled eggs 

-grilled fish/shrimp

-tons of vegetables and fruits (but I avoided potatoes)

-very SMALL portions of (always grilled) meat, unless grilled seafood (no particular reason for this, just going off what I felt)

-no bread whatsoever

-no dairy

-no drinks whatsoever except water

-avoiding sugar as much as possible, which I feel is the main offender to my skin problems, but I'm sure evidence surrounding that is controversial.

-lots and lots of nuts (might trigger acne for some)

-avoiding any unnecessary sauces and unnecessary flavorings like salt/pepper, etc.

Yeah, that doesn't seem like much food, but the fruits/vegetables category especially opens up the possibilities to tons of delicious, filling meals. And boiled eggs fill me up just as much as eating meat does.

I also sustained motivation by telling myself, ""This is just a 1 week experiment. You can do it for at least *that* long!"" etc, etc.

Anyway! At the end of the week, my skin was looking so smooth/non-bumpy/non-irritated that I felt the rewards were *definitely* worth the 'work'. Although it doesn't feel much like 'work' anymore since I've learned just how delicious healthy meals can be! So I've been going on ever since with this general diet. And my skin has only been getting better since.

For the record, I didn't use any acne products during or after the experiment.

I was using retin-a, clindamycin/BP cream, and a sulfa wash for the better part of 4-5 years, and my skin definitely cleared up during that time, breakouts were very minimal and manageable. At 20, I started having issues with [perioral dermatitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioral_dermatitis), so I stopped using the sulfa wash but kept the other things up and got a cream to help with the dermatitis. The dermatitis mostly cleared up, but I started to break out pretty badly despite keeping up with the retin-a and clindamycin.

Now, I hadn't broken out this badly since I was like 15. And recently turning 21, this was pretty crushing. I wasn't breaking out terribly, but it was probably the worst it's ever been, and people definitely started to notice when I went from having great skin to having a bunch of really bad inflamed pimples. I think it had to do with stopping the sulfa wash, because I have had no real changes in my diet but was always fine while using the wash. But I didn't want to rely on so many products anymore now that I was getting older, so I didn't bring the wash back in.

Did some research, people said it might be the diet causing adult acne since males don't really tend to have hormonal acne problems out of puberty. Dairy seemed to be the big one that people kept citing. I fucking love dairy products, I have been drinking milk and eating cheese/yogurt basically every day of my life. So giving that up seemed like it would really suck, but I decided to give it a try. And guess what? IT WORKED. After a few days of no dairy, new breakouts cut down drastically, and my skin started to clear up without any sulfa wash or anything! I made the mistake of eating a bunch of cheese/milk one day and ended up with a pretty bad breakout again, but as soon as I stopped it immediately cleared up. I'm still in the early stages of testing this, but so far cutting out dairy, while it really sucks, seems to be helping IMMENSELY. If nothing else is working, please give this a try. It could be something so simple that's causing breakouts. ",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_1ajes8,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1ajes8/adult_acne_what_finally_worked_for_me_male/,

Initially, it was just a bunch of whiteheads, but I've been picking them and that's probably what is causing the redness, swelling, and bulging. 

I know you're not supposed to pick them and just let them be, but holy shit, I'm not walking around on a college campus like that. Especially in the first week of classes. That picture is from a couple days ago, now it's all just red and swollen and the affected area is much larger. On top of that, new whiteheads form every day (in clusters often).

I also know that initial flaring is common at this stage of Accutane, but is it really supposed to be this intense? I don't know if I can handle it getting much worse. This morning, I literally collapsed after I saw my face in the mirror; took 2.5 hrs to make my face not look like volcanoes are erupting all over it. 

And this is all around the mouth area ONLY. Nowhere else on the face. So, is this common and normal? I can NOT leave them alone on my face. What else can I do to keep them from flaring? I've just been using Dove-for-men facewash and Vaseline moisturizer. I've got job interviews and presentations coming up...this isn't helping.

These have left scars everywhere on my forehead. As I got into High School, the forehead pimples weren't as severe, but I still broke out sometimes. However, for the first time I started to breakout on my cheeks, and pretty severely which also left scars. I am now graduated from college, but throughout college and even now I break out in random spots on my face, forehead, cheeks, mouth, chin, anywhere, and I still have scars. 

I will add that I was always a bit overweight, however during high school, i picked up a sport during which time I was very active, and during that time my acne cleared up a lot, however I again gained weight, wasn't very active, and sometimes I was too lazy to wash my face. Also I have very oily skin.

recently I haven't been sleeping well and started to break out, I decided to finally get serious about my acne. I feel that with this basic regimen, anyone can improve their acne situation, it's similar to losing weight, you must be dedicated.

* I started working out. I run probably every other day.
* I put a cloth or towel over my pillow when sleeping.
* I started using a cleanser, toner and oil free moisturizer twice everyday (morning and night). I haven't started yet, but I am going to exfoliate 1-2 times a week.
* I try to watch what I eat.
* I try to sleep early, or get a good amount of sleep.

The key is to stick with it no matter what. There are days I get home in the AM, and no matter how tired I am, I still wash my face. It has only been a week, and I already see my face clearing up, and it's not as oily anymore. I'm hoping once I get all my acne to clear up, that I can deal with my acne scars. 

The reason I wrote this up was because I realized after going through so many different products, that it really has nothing to do with what product you use. I would normally buy a new cleanser and wouldn't finish it within half a year because I didn't keep a strict regimen, and I didn't change my daily habits, and I'd blame it on the brand I used. The most important thing is your lifestyle. I'd say about 80% has to do with how you take of your body and 20% is what you use to clean your face. I know some people actually have skin deficiencies that cause them to have bad skin, but I think the most of us on here will benefit from this.

**TL;DR** Change your lifestyle habits, and follow a strict regimen to wash your face. :)

**edit** I just remembered one habit that I have picked up recently, that is to NOT touch your face. I try my best not to touch my face throughout the day, but I do have times that I touch my face without even knowing it, due to this fact, I try to wash my hands as often as possible.",,False,,t5_2qse3,1354480419.0,,,True,t3_145nyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/145nyy/my_experience_i_want_to_share_maybe_it_will_help/,

I had terrible cystic acne (averaged about 50 big acne cysts on my face at any time, largest was size of a penny!) and couldn't for the life of me understand why.  I deployed to Iraq and saw all these people who lived in filth, didn't have clean drinking water let alone bath water, no access to accutane or cleaning products but they have beautiful clear skin.  Not a single person I saw had the acne I did.  I had an incident in basic training where I unknowingly did push ups on an ant hill.  Got bit about 20 times and because of a slight allergy these little bits all looked like pimples.  I'm also asian and 90% of us can't drink cow milk.  It all hit me and I looked it up online, and the number 1 cause of acne is food allergy, and the number 1 food allergy is to cow milk.

Think about cow milk for a second.  It is designed to be fed to baby cows.  Cows have 4 stomachs... FOUR!.  Elmers glue has a cow on its logo because its made from milk protein(casein).  Cow milk requires 4 stomachs to be digested.  Ever seen cheese or milk in traditional chinese food?  Nope.  Got any East asian immigrant friends or Indian friends who have bad acne?  It's cow milk!! Cow milk is not designed for people.  

I read tons of beauty magazines, and not a single one would ever admit to food allergies being the cause of acne.  Think about why.  What would happen if they did say Milk Chocolate or Cheese caused acne?  They would lose millions of dollars in advertising from Hersheys, the Milk industry (think milk mustaches) and pizza advertisers.

My allergy was cow milk.  I had friends who got tested for allergies and found out they were allergic to hard water.  If you really think about acne, it isn't a disease, it is a sympton.  Much like coughing is a sign of the flu because your body is producing phlem to catch the viruses in your esophagus and you cough to discharge the phlem.  Acne is a sign that something is wrong with your body, not just your skin.

So before anyone goes through something drastic like Doxycycline , which I was on and lost 20lbs and really screws up your GI tract, or Accutane which may lead to depression, get tested for allergies.  You may become allergic to more things as you get older so everyone here please check.

I suffered for 14 years, and now I have terrible acne scars.  I just hope 1 person can read this and learn and might save them from the terrible scars, pain, and wasted time I experienced.  Getting rid of milk in your diet is NOT EASY.  It's not just drinking milk, it is butter, cream, whey, casein, ice cream, cheese, chocolate, many types of breads.  You would be surprised how many food products have milk. It isn't easy to give up those tasty things but when I look in the mirror I know it was worth it.

Mostly on the face, a bit on the shoulders that would flare up more in the winter when my shoulders didn't see the sun. The shoulder acne had gotten worse in the past year or so. My skin is very sensitive and a lot of makeups and shampoos, and ALL conditioners, will cause me to get tremendous acne breakouts. I can wear makeup powder but no liquid foundation. Even things that claim to be 'hypoallergenic' often times make my skin go crazy. I have to use hair detangling sprays formulated for toddlers and children because they are more gentle. 

I've tried a whole litany of things, as many of you probably have. I'd tried Clearasil wipes, alchohol pads, Proactiv, creams like Oxy 10, presurgical anti-bacterial scrub, very mild medications (not Accutane),  microdermabrasion, chemical peels, Burt's Bees scrub, and some kind of laser light thing I tried in like 8th grade that got rid of redness in my face for good, but individual spots still came up all the time. I've been on various different diets and none of them made a difference. I got on birth control 6 months ago, though not for acne purposes, and while one of the bonuses was that it was supposed to help with breakouts it made a very negligible difference. I would say my acne problem before recently was probably like a 6/10, or 7/10 on a really bad week.

**Two months ago I was at the end of my rope.** I tried new makeup to cover the problem but it only made it worse. I was considering Accutane but the side effects of that scares the shit out of me, and since I'm a girl taking a pregnancy test every month or whatever just to get a prescription seemed like a tremendous inconvenience. On a whim, I bought some Neutrogena Power Clear Scrub and Triple Action Toner from their Oil Free/Acne Stress control line... And OH MY WORD IT ACTUALLY WORKED. My shoulder acne is nearly 100 percent gone, with the occasional spot or two. I can wear tank tops and dresses with small straps again. Ahh. As for my face, I'd say my acne problem is down to a 2/10. Occasional small spots but SO MUCH BETTER NOW. I use the scrub in the shower, and after I get out and dry off I put on the toner. I'm actually really surprised something over the counter worked for me because I thought my acne problem was too severe for that, and that those types of things were only for people with the occasional spot.

It might not work for you because everyone's skin is different, but I figured I'd share my story because I'm sure a lot of people out there are like me who discounted things you can just buy at Target. For everyone, I'd suggest next time you're out shopping to try out a new system you've never used before. You never know, that might be the one to work for you. For girls, I'd say to also try changing your makeup and/or shampoo. Sometimes you use a product for so long that you don't realize an alternative may give you less breakouts.The sun also helps me but too much causes me to peel which in turn leads to breakouts.

But yeah. I just figured I'd share my success story because two months ago, before I tried these two products, I was truly about to post here asking questions about Accutane and other cures out of desperation.

And here is my face a few minutes ago: http://i.imgur.com/MoLw5CB.jpg?1

It's been 4 days since I've started the experiment. All of the red marks you see around my lips are merely remnants of what was already there four days ago. I have had no, I repeat, NO new breakouts since starting this experiment!!

Basically, what I've been doing is cutting fluoride out of my everyday life as much as humanly possible. This means I'm drinking Poland Spring all day every day - absolutely no tap water. I'm taking a gallon jug into the shower with me and washing my face with that, as well. I've found a list of beers with low-fluoride content:

http://ffbeers.com/

And I'm drinking only things on that list, preferably beers under 0.4 or 0.3 ppm fluoride content. Even more than that, I'm trying to supplant wine for beer. So I'm buying only French or Italian (not sure about Spanish?) wines that I'm positive are coming from a non-fluoridated country. I'm also taking a daily Kelp supplement; I believe it's a 400 microgram iodine content pill, and I take that in the morning (the iodine apparently offsets fluoride-related stuff).

As for food, I'm not exactly doing too much on that front - I maintain a pretty healthy diet as it is...almost no simple carbohydrates, lots of nuts, greens, meats on the grill, and always having water around. There's a section in the Fluoroderma e-book that discusses not eating any foods that might be made using a fluoridated water supply (restaurant pasta/beans/rice), so I *am* trying to stay away from that. But I have an inkling that the most pressing issue was my constant drinking of tap water, and washing my face with tap water.

I just want to say that this is the most incredible thing I have yet found in my decade-long search for a cure. I know this certainly won't work for everybody, but seeing these kinds of results after just four days of trying it out...god damn. Almost makes me wanna cry.

That's me from 2009-2013. 2010 was the hardest year of my life. My first year of uni and I had one of the most severe cases of acne. In December 2009 I had what I considered the 'regular' amount of pimples. Then somewhere over the summer holidays (Australia) it kicked into overdrive. I had been using a an 'oxy' pimple cream which worked on individual pimples but cystic was beating it down. 

I tried Clinque's Three stage treatment around February which didn't appear to work (month of wasted effort). I went on proactiv in April and gave it the accepted month to take effect. After that failure I was having serious confidence issues. Breaking down etc

Up until this point I was still hearing the 'it's all part of growing up' bullshit. I went to the GP who got me on minocyclin and a surface gel. He also said it was part f growing up but agreed to refer me to a dermatologist. This was around May. I had been on minocyclin for a few weeks when that photo was taken.

I finally found a dermatologist that would see me after hours (I was wait listed at 3). He was shocked that people were telling me it was natural and got me on 40mg of Accutane and 2000mg of Erythromycin a day. Let me tell you high doses of Erythromycin is like being immune to EVERYTHING.

The doc told me to work up to 40mg so as not damage my system. I week after I reached 40mg I started having serious back problems. I suffered through it for a week because I just wanted my face to get better. The Doctor got me off Accutane until my back was returned to normal and then set me up on 30mg a day. This was the correct dose as I didn't have any more side effects.

It was a slow process but it finally declined. I was still a bit red and patchy when I turned 18 but it was obviously getting better. By December it was just pitting. Now it's a little bit of scarring and bad memories.

If you've reached the bottom of this congratulations. It's a bit longer than I was intending... All I can say is if you're ever worried, see your Doctor. It's worth it, you may be able to stop it before high doses of harmful medicine are necessary. 

Also, be careful with the alleged side effects of accutane, depression and suicide may seem serious but bad acne can drive you in the same direction. If you're sad and feel self conscious because of your acne accutane can bring you back. It was acne that handicapped my social skills in 2010 (still haven't recovered fully) and accutane that stopped me from doing something that now seems unthinkable.

Just a few of the things I tried:
Proactive
Carley's clean and clear,

7 Other assorted Benzoyl Peroxide products,

Chromium picolinate,
Vitamin A,
2 DIfferent antibiotics,
And I've been to the dermatologist 9 times in the last 3 years

I also started going to an esthetician twice a week for extractions and assorted other treatments. My skin hates me and is incredibly red all the time but I have made steady progress.

When I was 15 I started using Proactiv for the first time because I was starting to get annoyed at my occasional pimples. After 3 months of non-stop use day and night I saw little to none improvement. I gave up on it and just out right stopped trying to fix it for a while.

Then when I was about 16 and a half my acne began to get progressively worse. It went from the occasional 1 or 2 pimples every few days to about 6 or 7 every day, all around my neck, mainly my jawline, forehead and cheeks but also around my shoulders and chest. I don't know what suddenly sparked this constant hell but I don't think it was 'puberty' since my voice broke when I was 14. 

I've been on and off Proactiv 2-3 times over the last 2 years for about 2 months at a time but eventually giving up after seeing no improvement.I am 3 months away from being 18 and this problem hasn't lessened or even began to seem like it may begin to go away anytime soon. I have resorted to wearing make up foundation to help cover up my acne.

I'm a guy and yes IT IS extremely embarrassing to have someone, especially a friend notice that I am wearing make up. I literally won't leave the house without it due to how bad my skin looks without it. As a result about 5 or 6 of my close friends have noticed over the last year as my acne has been getting worse and thus I've been having to wear more and more makeup to cover it up. 

Someone asking ""Are you wearing makeup?"" is the moment I dread more than anything and thus I've been paranoid of that question every second I'm within close proximity of someone. I'm trying to stay positive about life and school (I'm currently in my senior year of high school) but it's getting harder and harder to keep my chin up when I'm worried about people seeing the pimples under it. I'm managing to stay relatively happy but having very low self-esteem as a result of my acne is making it very difficult to continue to do so.

Here are some pictures I just took of [my acne's current state](http://imgur.com/a/CT9Qr)

Thus I'm asking for Reddit's help. Fellow Redditors, what kind of treatment would you recommend for this type of acne? What would best deal with this specific type of acne?

Any help that could rid me of what I hate most about myself would be greatly appreciated.

All the other store bought cleaners works for maybe a week and then its back to normal redness. I don't really want to go back on accutane so I was curious what you guys thought.

I am 21/f and have been suffering with acne for 14 years. (started in 3rd grade when I began puberty) I have tried everything under the sun and my skin literally has not been completely clear in 14 years. I tried proactive a number of times, every brand of face wash, scrub, moisturizer, spot treatment, toner. I've tried retin-a, a bunch of different types of pills.. You get the point... Everything.

I finally pulled the trigger and went on accutane. Luckily, my health insurance gives it to me for only 14 dollars a month. I am just about finished with my fourth month. Still am breaking out though but I am being patient. Esspecially break outs on my jaw line, on my chin and around my chin and cheeks. I have some pretty nasty scars on my cheeks and super large deep pores.

I am experiencing side effects of course but nothing serious. Thank god, because that's what held me back from taking the medication for years since I already have depression and general anxiety disorder. (currently on 10mg of lexapro for that and have both under control.)

I started accutane with 20mg, 40mg for two months after that, took a month off because the stupid ipledge program wouldn't give me a refill for 30 days, and just finished my 4th dose at 60mg.

Side effects I have:
-dry flaky skin on face
-very very dry skin all over
-dry hair
-I produce no oil what so ever (my face used to be a grease-slick.. I used 5 oil blotters a day!)
-rash on hands
-dry nose
-I wake up every morning with dry crusty boogers (sorry gross) that I literally can't blow or pick out without bleeding or crying.
-bloody dry flaky lips and cuts on the side of my mouth, extremely painful to open my mouth all the way.

So here is my PERFECTED skin care regime while being on accutane, I hope some of you on accutane or have SEVERLY dry sensitive skin can use it to your benefit as well!

Morning:
-wash with CeraVe foaming cleanser
-put on CeraVe PM facial moisturizing lotion (while my face is still fairly damp to lock the moisture in)
-Aczone for spot treatment (don't know how much it does but it makes me feels better putting it on huge red zits or cysts)
-Benefit Hello flawless oxygen WOW Foundation and apply with a foundation brush
-then a little mac studio fix powder on top just to set it.
-For my body, I put coconut oil EVERYWHERE! Apply on moist skin right out of the shower.
-cruel itch defense for dry itchy skin on problem areas. The back of my arms, calves, and hands and bumpy and dry they feel like sand paper ugh!

Night time:
-wash face with clearasonic mia2 using CeraVe foaming cleanser
-cerave PM

All day:
-aquaphor for lips, Vaseline lip repair, or blistex moisture melt for my lips.
-cvs brand hand cream
-target brand nasal moisturizing spray


I hope I helped some of you on this tough journey on accutane and if you have any questions at all please comment!!!!!!!!

As a long time acne sufferer, I have tried about everything you can imagine to help with the issue; most recently being changing my diet. About 3 weeks ago, I started to cut out refined sugars from my diet. Ironically, I did this not to help with acne, but because of an ear-ringing problem I had been having that I was able to link to high blood sugar levels. Anyway, I stopped drinking soda completely, replaced sugary drinks with either water of juice (not the best alternative, I know), cut out high sugar snacks etc, basically started paying way more attention to my diet and sugar intake. Within these few weeks I noticed that my face had started to clear up; not perfectly, as I have a poor complexion to begin with, but definitely noticeable clarity. I would have smaller and less severe pimples when I did get them, and my face started to appear more smooth. 

Now, I would say this could be a coincidence with my breakout cycle, but within the last few days I have been slipping on my better diet. Because I haven't had my annoying tinnitus (ringing in the ear) problem for a while, I thought I could slowly incorporate the sugar that I have so dearly missed back into my diet. As I should have expected, my face is now worse than it has been in months. Time to go back to the diet, I guess. 

Occasionally however, I can't help but to  think about the history of acne in human beings. Acne has really only been an issue for a very brief time. There is a reason that our long lost ancestors didn't suffer like we do. There is a reason that the ""cavemen"" or the nomads or the Native Americans never had breakouts. In fact, I believe there are many reasons. And it has everything to do with lifestyle. 

These people, our ancestors, every human being preceding the last few generations has endured a very difficult lifestyle. One where you had to work very hard to eat very little, exercise and burn thousands of calories just to maintain a life for oneself and one's family. Nowadays, none of us have to do any of that, so we find it very difficult to eat right and exercise often. Not to mention, these people didn't have the luxury of using the countless OTC creams, washes, and acne agents that we have today. And in some ways, I think they contribute to the problem. I haven't fully tried the ""caveman"" regimen, but I feel that coupled with proper diet and exercise, it would, like it did for every human before us, prevent and in this case cure acne effectively. 

This is just my opinion of acne's root cause. There is so much that contributes to it that it's hard to pinpoint. As a long time sufferer, I am just tired of western medicine trying to bombard me with OTC products, antibiotics and drugs, when really I'm sure the answer to my problems lies in a healthier lifestyle. No dermatologist of mine has ever suggested that, and it's disappointing that a healthier lifestyle isn't the first and foremost thing prescribed.

1355029252.0,9,self.acne,14j94p,my personal treatment and advice for treating acne. i've been dealing with it for 15 so years and only recently i have been healing. take some time to read thru my process of elimination. hopefully this will be useful for someone finding a solution.,forkarma,14,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/14j94p/my_personal_treatment_and_advice_for_treating/,"first a bit of back story to give you an idea of myself. i'm turning 30 next year which means i started getting acne around 15. at the time it wasn't as bad and i thought i'd out grow it and didn't pay much attention to it. things got worse when i hit my 20's and it spiked when i had an accident and had to get surgery. not sure what caused it to spike, probably the pain meds i was taking in addition to the stress of having to attend school plus my unhealthy diet. it was my major low point in life and i really suffered from depression.


==============for severe situations read from here========================



how bad was it? first of all i have high cheek bones, the type that makes my cheeks already shiny and visible on its own. now add cystic acne on top of that, plus 3 or so white heads on that one cystic acne. now imagine a cluster of cystic acne. plus on my neck. yes, it was that bad. 

if your current situation is similar to this, i suggest you see a dermatologist and ask them to prescribe you with accutane. it's a prescription drug which has strict rules before you can get it. you shouldn't have a history of depression, which i'm pretty sure you already have if you're dealing with this type of acne but in my case i told them i didn't and they gave it to me either way.

accutane is a powerful drug, it dries you up so much. in my experience, i was on it for 3-4 months. they prescribe you for 1 month, then you check back with your derma and depending on the results, they either give you another or lighten your dosage.

they also have a steroid that they inject on the cystic acne, they can give you these on the spot during visits, just ask them and they'll do it. this stuff is also powerful and shrinks the bump on that very same day.

once i was taken off accutane, i still had acne flare ups on me but it wasn't as severe anymore but it still came in clusters and i always had to deal with it every day.





=========for average situations and my process of eliminations here==============



by average, i'm still probably on the severe scale but not so much cystic anymore. i'd still have clusters form on my cheeks and neck area so i decided to take it upon myself to find a healthy balance for my personal treatment. this is where i started my process of eliminations.

i know how it goes, you research about it on google, watch youtube videos, buy products and so on. i did all of that, and they all helped out with my testing and now i'd like to share my results with you.

fisrt of all, the whole argument about whether or not food has anything to do with it?! i'd say about 60-40 and 60% of that is true, 40% false.

how to make sense of that?

it's true that certain foods cause acne, but it doesn't mean you cannot eat what you want. people eat the same thing we eat but they don't have what we have. i remember watching a video where the dermatologist said, certain foods are like gasoline to a fire. if the acne is still new, then eating chips and drinking soda will cause it to flare up. if there's no source of fire, then the gasoline won't ignite anything.

so here's how i handle this.

everything is in moderation.

everything is measured.



============for diet read here===========


this is my food lifestyle. try it and see if it helps.

i always have rice in every meal, so i measure one cup of rice. whatever meal that goes with that, should be just enough to match that amount of rice. use your judgement to deal with that, you're only cheating yourself if you decide to ignore this.

even though i said ""it doesn't mean you cannot ever eat what you want"", there are many things i avoid eating and drinking just to make sure i'm getting the most of my research. i'm being realistic here and i want you to know my lifestyle as it is for your comparison.

Solids don't eat
* fast food
* processed food (everything in a can, bags of chips, and yes, including instant noodles)
* fried foods (i use a grill instead of frying)
* fried fish is by far the biggest flare up trigger for me


Liquids don't drink
* soda
* energy drinks
* milk or any dairy alternatives like soy or skim

* coffee - i want to write a section dedicated to coffee as this is the reason why i'm writing this whole thing. i can't seem to sum up my thoughts on how to best summarize this. everything i've done up until this point, i've always had acne. when i finally decided to eliminate coffee, it just stopped.

my daily life is like this. coffee in the morning, i'd go to work, and at around noon, i'd always get new swollen spots on my face, which would later form into acne. it would stress me the fuck out, since i've been very diligent with everything. i decided, maybe it's coffee. this was my eureka moment. i drink huge mugs of coffee every morning, with sugar and cream. i have no idea why i didn't think about eliminating that sooner. this was just about 2 weeks ago or so. ever since then, i could ease up on the things i couldn't eat like chips and fried foods, and i wouldn't get as bad of a reaction compared to before.

i'm thinking coffee was a huge catalyst for everything i take in. this was a huge moment for me, and i can't describe how nice it feels when everything i've sacrificed for so long was not in vain. the subtraction of coffee plus the diligence i've put in to this whole research really made it a success for me. 15 years. hopefully all of this would help you avoid that.


solids can eat
i'm still healing so i still maintain a pretty strict diet plus it's also good for my personal health, since at my age and life style, i'd better start watching what i eat.

* chicken or turkey meat
* vegies
* fruits
* nuts (always in moderation don't gobble down bags)
* pretty much anything as long as it's boiled, grilled, or baked. if i have to fry it, which i rarely do, i'd use olive oil.

liquids can drink
to be honest all i drink is water, sometimes maybe juice, but if there's one thing you can have an excess of, it's water. i have a huge glass, and i drink a lot.


when eating, i only eat during breakfast, lunch and dinner. i avoid snacking in between. if i do feel hungry and want to eat something, i'd eat fruits. bananas are a constant. apples, grapes, berries. if you can afford chips and sodas, you can swap those out for fruits instead.

again with the diligence and patience.



===================for hygiene and daily treatments read here====================


these are the things i do on a daily basis that i believe contribute a huge part to my healing.

* i wash my face first thing in the morning and before going to bed.

* i avoid touching my face as much as possible.

* if i have a new zit forming, i wait for it until it doesn't hurt when i press on it, then i can pop it. never pop it if it still hurts, it will come back twice as worse and causes to heal twice as long.

* when popping a zit, i learned from dermatologists that the best way to do it is to press down from the sides rather than pinching from the sides. by pressing down this makes sure that everything is out, plus i think pinching leaves a bigger mark which is another reason to avoid it. better to press down on it. this is perhaps the only time i ever touch my face but i use tiny sheets of toilet paper on the tips of my fingers to prevent slipping, and to make sure that whatever comes out, gets soaked up rather than have it drip on my face.


* washing my face, i use a small face towel that i soak in running water and use it to prepare my face for washing, i never use my hands on my face even when showering. always with the face towel.

* exfoliate, i pair it up with (Clean &amp; Clear Oil-Free Foaming Facial Cleanser) as my facial wash in addition to a product online which you can get from amazon it's called (BriteLeafs Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless (BL-813)) 

this might be a bit harsh for some people depending on your skin type, but i'm pretty thorough on myself and i actually use the body brush (the larger brush in that set) on my face alone, using my own hands without the machine.

but before i use the brushes, when they're dry, the bristles are pretty tough even for me, what i do is i get a large cup that can hold these brushes in, fill it with hot water and let is sit for 5mins, so the bristles soften up and then i can use them on my face.

* moisturize, after i shower, i use the smaller brush with the machine and dip it in a product called (hawaiian Moon Aloe) not sure if it's available on amazon but it is online, or you can use your own as long as it's non comedogenic.

* Meladerm - as for topological creams there's one product i highly recommend. it's called Meladerm. buy it from their website. use this after showering. at night before going to bed and during the day only if you're staying at home, if you're going out, then try not to use this. best to avoid the sun when using it.

what this does for me, is the dark spots that popped acne leaves, this gets rid of it! use it diligently and it will do wonders. the spotting i got on my neck face are almost gone, it takes time to work but this speeds up the healing process compared to letting it clear up on its own without treatment.





=======cleaning up destressing a bit ocd but effective and good practice overall==========





for me, my room is my number 1 sanctuary, my shrine. i spend so much time in my room that if i could work from home i would. so the obvious brain fart for me was, if i'm spending so much time in this one place, i might as well make it the best damn place ever. which lead to the following.

i cleaned up all my crap. dusted and mopped the whole place and for maintenance, i dust, mop and sweep my room once a week. every sunday to be exact. yes i am OCD, but there's a method to my madness, and a reason to my insanity.

another brain fart that occurred to me is my bed. in our life time, we spend at least 1/4 of that sleeping. the fact that i'm already a hermit means i probably spend more than the average person in bed sleeping. so if i were to spend money on anything else aside from building up my computer or buying steam games, it'd be for my bed.

number one is my pillow. if you have acne like me i'm sure you know the feeling of having blood stains on your pillow case and then those blood stains pass thru the pillow case onto the pillow itself. one solution i figured out that really helps is to use a bath towel. i have the big bath towels that i can fold in half and have a thicker padding to lay on since i bleed pretty bad when i sleep. the other good thing about using bath towels is that it can better absorb your sweat and oils on your face compared to just a pillow case.

here's what i do, i fold it in half for one night, the next night i flip that half over on its back, then on the following night, i fold it inside out, and the final night i flip it to the back. after that, i get a new towel and repeat.

i do my laundry every week as well so everything is fresh and new which eliminates stress of dirty laundry piling up.

try to get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep. it takes about an hour to get yourself to fall asleep so best to make it 9, remember 8 is just the minimum.

all of this has been the result of my diligence thru trial and error. i've been dealing with this for many years and only recently, i'm slowly healing. hopefully this would end up useful to someone going thru the same problems. always keep in mind that this takes time. healing takes time. it's basically a wound you're taking care of, so always be gentle and patient. i've dealt with it for many years, hopefully this would help lessen this ordeal for you. good luck!",,False,,t5_2qse3,1355064006.0,,,True,t3_14j94p,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/14j94p/my_personal_treatment_and_advice_for_treating/,

I still get mild/moderate acne that fluctuates all the time, one week I can be 'ok' the next can flair up quite bad like this week. I get blackheads, and these under the skin type spots or raised bumps, which kind of look like a whitehead under the skin, and they squeeze out like a blackhead in a solid lump. I've tried all the off the shelf products you can think of, all different types of face cleaners, also benzyl peroxide 2.5/5/10%, freederm, tee tree oil.. you name it.

I've been to the doctors a couple of times, the first time he gave me some duac daily, that didn't seem to do much. Next time I went she told me I shouldn't be washing my face as I have inflammatory acne, and that I should only just be splashing my face with warm water, then again with cold to close the pores. She also gave me some nicam gel to reduce the inflammation but that seemed to make my skin dry and make it worse. Every day is a dilemma as to what to do with my skin, I shower twice a day, so currently I alternate by washing my face with some Aleppo soap (I read somewhere that this is good for acne), and then other times I'll just splash my face with water. Afterwards I'm using a Nivea moisturizer.  
  
I seem to get quite oily skin, especially all around my nose, but I do think it gets worse when it gets really dry, but when I moisturize I'm convinced it makes things worse, seems like it's catch-22.  
  
I eat well, I don't eat any junk, I've been going to the gym for the last 2-3 months, 4-5 times a week. I drink lots of water, I do drink quite a bit of milk but I gave it up for a few weeks and it didn't seem to make a difference. I change my pillow case every other night.

The results are noticeable, and my face is clearer, and I am happier with how my face looks. Results of the 30 days are below. [Link to my post 30 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/y4u4x/i_will_be_giving_up_dairy_for_one_month_im_hoping/). [Link to my inspiration for not eating dairy](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/y48c3/dairy_caused_my_acne/). 

Before:

-Many red spots, whiteheads, small acne bumps. (Very typical)


Results:

-Days 1-3 no noticeable changes.

-After 7 days, I noticed that no new whiteheads had formed since day 3, and none have formed since.

-My red spots have noticeably diminished in size and and prevalence.

I still have acne, but the redness is much less pronounced, I am happy with how it turned out. I believe the diet works.

What I did:
Instead of milk+cereal for breakfast I have been eating pancakes, waffles, and oatmeal (with no butter). I'm going to continue to keep away from dairy. I kept everything that might effect my acne the same, ie washing my face everyday after school, not eating sugar or soda. 

I encourage you to try it, it makes a difference for me, and it may for you. Though, I'd like to point out that this is too small a sample size to say that giving up dairy works.

I did not go *completely* without dairy. For example, my friends served spaghetti with parmesan cheese. I tried to keep things like that to a minimum, and I did fairly well.

I hope these help you too.,Stendhal,16,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1j3mfh/my_personal_tips_for_what_helped_me_with_my/,"I've been dealing with cystic acne for years, but in the last couple years I've done a few things to reduce/eliminate breakouts. 

* **Cut out dairy**, mostly. Have the occasional pizza slice or yogurt  once in a blue moon, but in terms of regular and daily intake, just cut it out. Replace it with almond milk. 
* **Get a retin-a-micro prescription**. I say micro specifically because it's usually in a gel form and the medicine time-releases which means it works on your skin, for longer. You can also get this in generic and if you don't have health insurance, there are online pharmacies as well. 
* **Sunscreen**, preferably one with a little zinc because it calms the skin. Sun exposure occasionally is good for acne as it dries out oil, but with cystic acne it's not really helpful so it's best to wear sunscreen and keep your skin in optimum condition as sunscreen mitigates uv damage. 
* **Neither too hot nor too cold water**, simply wash with lukewarm. 
* **Less is more.** I use retin-a-micro, a sunscreen, and a salicylic wash as my regular routine. I only wash with water in the morning, put on the sunscreen, and when I come home I take it off with salicylic acid wash (neutrogena acne cleanser) and either put on a moisturizer or just put on my retin-a-micro (I'm a homebody so I don't always go out after work). With cystic acne, your skin's strength is really important as it can help to resist breakouts. Doing too much to it just erodes your skin's natural barrier and resiliency. 
* **Diet is really important for cystic acne.** Eat well, you'll maintain your body's internal balance. Bring in greens and fruits and other veggies into your diet as often as you can. I literally eat one large bowl of mixed greens, carrot, blueberries, and cherries every day. 
* **Make note of any medications you might be taking**, some can mess around with your hormones.
* **Do NOT take biotin or eat too many foods with biotin.** I learned this the hard way. I went on a chia seed kick because it's so good for you (yes I read Born to Run), but it has almost 100% of your biotin requirements in a mere tablespoon and I was mixing like 3-4 tablespoons with my water or tea everyday. 
* **EXERCISE.** Can't stress this enough for cystic acne. Exercise increases your body's production of antioxidants like glutathione and regulates your body. Notice how most athletes simply don't have acne. Especially do cardio (running, elliptical, whatever, just make sure you sweat), and some weight lifting.   
* **If you're a dude, try not to shave too often. And when you do, make sure you shave with great technique.** Some tips: Don't shave against the grain, shave down always. I use a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power which tends to get close enough to be professional without shaving against the grain. Steam opens up pores and softens hair so try and take a long shower before you shave. Then use a cleanser on your face because dirt and grime collected in your pores can make shaving more tough and cause irritation. Then use a badger brush and a true shaving cream. Put some cream in a normal kitchen mug that you don't use, lather up the badger brush by moving it around in the mug, then apply the brush to your face with small circular movements until you get a good lather, do this for 5 minutes. Then finally go ahead and shave. 
* I've heard some people have reduced or eliminated gluten in their diet. I haven't so I don't know but it couldn't hurt I suppose. 

Anyway, this is what has worked for me, my skin has been clear for a while now. Here's a pic of me making a dumb face, lol. http://i.imgur.com/uOw5ffG.jpg

But I got to thinking, given how excessively hot showers dry out the skin and make it overcompensate oil production, maybe warm showers do the same thing to a lesser extent. So maybe fully cold showers wouldn't wash away the excess oil but after a short adjustment period maybe there wouldn't *be* excess oil!

Then he went on saying things like "" this isn't real acne."" ""It's normal for women"" with that sentence I looked at thos femal helpers of him, both with clear skin, not seeming offended or laughing. I honestly thought he was joking.

After a last ""you shouldn't touch your face"" he wrote down some antibiotics,  told his assistant to tell me what to do and left.  All of that took maybe 3 minute if not less.

After this experience I went into depression. Some other things added to that. Now (over one year later) I'm still scared to go to another dermatologist. I'm just scared to hear all of that again.

I am a 24-year-old female and I have had acne in some form since I was ten (rough, I know - I have incredibly oily skin and my dad had a pretty bad case of acne when he was younger, so I'm sure the deck was always stacked against me.) It started as pustules on my forehead when I was young and developed into face, shoulder and upper back acne when I was a teenager. I tried Proactiv (though I wasn't too consistent with it), started going to a dermatologist who gave me a few prescriptions (creams AND pills, unfortunately I can't remember their names) and received skin treatments (microdermabrasion, some UV light treatment, the whole nine yard) all with limited success. My skin would look slightly clearer for a week or two and then go right back to normal. I stopped going to the dermatologist when I was about 17 because nothing seemed to be working, and I had heard from friends that acne usually started clearing up around age 18 or 19, so I figured I could wait it out. Over the past few years, I've washed my face usually two to three times a day (with basic drugstore brands, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Body Shop's tea tree soap) and used various astringents, I put my hair up in a ponytail when I'm at home so it doesn't touch my face, I sleep with a clean towel over my pillow and I only wear make-up when necessary to avoid clogging my pores. So, my question is - WHAT ON EARTH AM I DOING WRONG?!?! I no longer get pimples on my shoulders or back (at least not very many), and my breakouts are usually localized to my chin, forehead and jawline. And while my skin will go through periods of a few weeks where it is relatively clear, it always breaks out again.

Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that a couple of years ago, I exercised regularly and ate pretty healthy and my skin got noticeably better, but still not 100% clear. I don't currently exercise and I've gotten back into the habit of eating a lot of fast food. How much of an impact could that be having on my skin?

I have been doing this for over a week and I am very impressed with the results. I am 29 and have had acne problems for years. I tend to get the deep, large, red cystic acne. I had been using Proactive for a long time, but was no longer getting good results from it. I thought it was time for a change. If you haven't tried this, you may want to give it a shot. 

Here is my daily regimen:

Morning: 
Wet face, rub a couple of teaspoons or so of raw honey on it, leave on for a few minutes, rinse off with cool water. Follow with a little bit of pure, extra-virgin coconut oil to moisturize. (It's comedogenic, but since it melts at 76 degrees, I don't think it really can clog pores like it would if it were in a cool, solid state...I'm no expert, I am just speaking from my own observations) 

Evening: 
Remove makeup with a gentle face wash (honey won't remove makeup -- I use witch hazel cleanser) moisturize with pure, extra-virgin coconut oil.

Look up using these two ingredients for your face and you'll find tons of blogs raving about them. But, you never know until you try. I've heard about lots of variations like adding nutmeg to the honey or mixing nutmeg, cinnamon and honey together to make a thick paste for spot treatment...and so on. Just thought I'd put this out there for anyone struggling who hasn't tried this.

I started coming on here a few months ago, and I tried some things but didn't have much success due to my extremely sensitive skin, so I gave up and sank back into acnedom. It doesn't need to be said, but everyone's skin is different, and no regimen works for everyone.

Nowadays, I'm pretty much acne free thanks to a few simple changes which I've made in my habits and routine on my own. I still get the occasional pimple and I have blackheads, but I'm not breaking out and having my inflamed facial acne kill my confidence.

Here's what I did (which may or may not work for you):

1. EXFOLIATE: I cannot emphasize how much this has helped me. I'd always have oily, flaky skin, and it would clog my pores really badly. I use a sponge to exfoliate because it's rougher than a washcloth and easier to clean (I use dish soap on it so it doesn't get gross). I use it on my face and body.

2. STOP USING REGULAR SOAP: I switched to a natural soap which is made of natural oils (for the curious: http://www.drbronner.com/DBMS/TEA.htm). I tried a bunch of different products before I found this, and I love it. Due to my sensitive skin, I only use it every other shower (lukewarm showers btw, hot showers=bad), the other times I just rinse off and exfoliate.

3. DIET: I started eating way more raw fruits and vegetables, and this made my skin feel less inflamed and oily. 

4. MOISTURIZE: I started using a moisturizing cream recommended by a friend. I use it on my entire body after I've completely dried from the shower. (http://www.niveausa.com/products/NIVEA-Soft)

5. DON'T PICK: This was a big one for me, I'm a picker, and I have the scars to prove it. I was DXed with dermatillomania, so it's not exactly an easy thing to avoid. Try to avoid picking, wash your hands beforehand if you can't resist, and keep your nails short and clean.

I've gone through everything and anything in my middle/high/college days to fix my acne. I've tried every antibiotic, probiotic, tea, diets, crazy tips, and anything I thought would help. At the end of the day all it took was.....honey. Plain and simple. 
Every day for 20-30 minutes I would do a honey facemask and I haven't had a breakout in 3 weeks! I have not seen my face this clear since 7th grade. Also drink plenty of water (I do a gallon a day).

Heres my routine:

* Wash face with luke warm water
* Honey mask for 20-30 min (or longer if you have time or just hanging out at home)
* Wash with cold water
* Moisturize (coconut oil works for me)
* I pat my face down with a dry towel right after the coconut oil, keeps my face moisturized and doesn't have    that shiny gloss look so you can go out.

The thing is, I've got red marks all over my face and blackheads on my nose and forehead. I'm not sure what to do about the blackheads, but I've heard that BHAs can help with discoloration.

Like a lot of acne sufferers I tended to wash my face more often than recommended. Its a catch 22 because the more you wash, the more your skin produces comodogenic oils. 
SO about a week ago I started a new regiment. I wash my face ONCE a day in the morning then rub in a light amount of non-comodogenic cetaphil facial moisturizing lotion. Acne on my face stopped occurring IMMEDIATELY. My theory is that by manually supplying my skin with a non-comodogenic form of moisturizer, I prevent my body from producing excess natural oils, and therefore allow my skin to remain soft, clean, and moisturized, without any pore clogging oils.I realize this isnt an earth shattering breakthrough, but I was afrade to try it for years, because I automatically associated Oils with acne... and now that I finally gave it a shot, it worked instantly.

Hope I'm not jinxing myself!,lilyrae,12,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/172604/acne_free_for_2_weeks_hope_im_not_jinxing_myself/,"I'm 21, I've had acne since I was 12. It's grown steadily worse over the years. I always wondered, ""shouldn't it get BETTER as I get older?"" The last two years have been full of cystic acne. I've got so many scars and indentations and red spots... :( My skin tends to be very very oily, and I know I have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads. I used to be so obsessive about my skin that I'd spend an hour in front of the mirror extracting all the blackheads and whiteheads, and if I had a cyst, I'd drain it with needles. Bad idea, bro. But I was young and so frustrated with the acne that I just wanted to get rid of it by any means necessary!


I honestly don't do much to my face anymore for acne. Whenever I would start washing, my face would break out and fight it. Any sort of medication would make it worse, and I'd give up pretty easily. I stopped wearing foundation and powder hoping that would help, but there was no difference. For a while I was on Ortho Tri-cyclin Lo, due to a boyfriend but also because I was told it would help the acne. I thought that was helping a little bit, but it came back. 


For the last month or so I have not washed my face once. When I take a hot shower, I'll use a dry wash cloth to just wipe the oil and dirt from my face, but I don't use any product whatsoever. That seems to help. 2 weeks ago I stopped taking the B.C. Aside from 2 very very small surface pimples, I have been acne free!!!! I'm happy but also terrified that cysts are forming right now and they'll all pop up at once in a week or so.


Not quite sure if this will help anyone. Does anyone have a similar story? By the way, I haven't really changed my diet at all.

1358747214.0,7,self.acne,16z36w,How I keep my moderate acne under control.,gearheaven,14,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/16z36w/how_i_keep_my_moderate_acne_under_control/,"Hello! :) This is my first post, hooray! I am here to share with you my acne story and offer advice for those seeking.

I'll try to keep my story somewhat short. Please bear with me as I'm typing this from my pain-in-the-ass phone.

I just turned 24 and I've been dealing with acne since the 4th grade. Both my parents had acne (my mom had it especially bad) so I got hit hard with breakouts. I also had a very poor diet as a child, which probably didn't help my problem. My acne started on my forehead and eventually spread to my whole face. In high school, I tried proactiv, which worked well for a while. It stopped working for me eventually, which seems to be the case for many proactiv users. I tried practically every over the counter acne treatments with little success. There was one year, however, that I recall being very clear from using a straight up benzoyl peroxide cream. For whatever reason, I stopped using benzoyl peroxide because I thought my skin would be better off if I used products that were 'all natural'. Bad mistake, my skin ended up breaking out in severe acne. It quickly got infected to the point where it looked like I had impentigo covering my entire face. Luckily, a nurse practioner was able to clear me with a short course of antibiotics, prednisone, and a course of accurate.

The results I got from accutane were unfortunately short-lived and I eventually started breaking out again (I believe after about 6 months post-accutane) This seems to be the case for. a lot of females who take accutane, due to our crazy fluctuations in hormones. ;) The good news is my acne was never considered severe after that.

I do still suffer from moderate acne, but I've been following a regimen that has kept it pretty damn in control! I'm about 90% clear now. I would probably be even more clear if I'd cut back on drinking on the weekends and didn't each so much carbs/sugar, but eh, life.

Treatments I've tried but gave up on:
- Salicylic acid topicals (2%) unfortunately do nothing for me.
- Honey masks
- Aspirin masks
- Using just water on the skin
- Using natural soaps and moisturizers (made it soooo much worse!)
- Antibiotics (didn't want to become resistant)
- Proactiv
- Differin (this I most recently stopped using. It worked well for a while but eventually lost its effectiveness.)
- Taking tons of supplements that supposedly help acne (my room looked like a damn GNC store but in the end, I don't remember much difference to my acne.
- Hormonal contraceptives (tried many- all made my skin so much worse, plus made me batshit crazy!)
- Accutane

What I do now is pretty simple. I'm back to using benzoyl peroxide on a twice a day basis. I pretty much follow the ""acne.org regimen"" but with a twist.

Products: 
- Purpose cleanser (my absolute favorite!) I use this once a day.

- Vivite glycare cleanser. This contains 10% glycolic acid, which is a chemical exfoliant that breaks up dead skin cells at the surface. I apply this without water and spread it around my face for about a minute. In all honesty, I'll probably stop using this once the product is gone and use a glycolic acid moisturizer instead.

- Paula's Choice Clear treatment gel, which is a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. I use this during the day because it wears very well under my makeup. I tend to use the acne.org benzoyl peroxide at night (again, 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.)

- Vivite replenishing cream. This is hands down the best moisturizer I've ever used. Its oil free, contains anti-irritants and antioxidants. I freaking love it. Using benzoyl peroxide tends to leave me with dry/flaky skin, especially in the harsh winter weather. This is the only moisturizer I've found to help. My ONLY gripe is it's so damn expensive. Ugh, its worth it I suppose. 

- Olay complete for sensative skin w/SPF 15.

- Sometimes I'll spot treat with 10% sulfur ointment. I forgot the name, but it comes in a small yellow jar and it says ""de la sol"" on it. Works awesome to shrink.a.blemish.

- Once a month, I try to do a 20% salicylic acid peel. The one I use is from skinlaboratories and it has great reviews on Amazon and other sites. I find its great for clearing blackheads &amp; small breakouts, and also great for softening scars &amp; evening out my skin tone. I haven't been able to do a peel in a few months because I'm undergoing laser treatments for my deeper pitted scarring.

MAKEUP:
- First off, I absolutely stay away from primers. Primers are loaded with dimethicone, which can cause acne to become much worse. That is because dimethicone acts as a barrier on the skin and can ""seal"" oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria underneath.

- I use mineral makeup only. I stay away from bare minerals since its loaded with bismuth oxychloride (not the matte version, though.) The brand I use is ""glominerals"", which hasn't given me any problems so far. :)

MISC:
- I'll give myself a microdermabrasion treatment once in a while to help with blackheads and to smooth out my skin.

- Any time I get a pustule (what many call a ""whitehead""), I always extract it. NEVER PICK AT YOUR SKIN! You can, however, extract. Doing so prevents the spread of inflammation and the pustule heals quite quickly. The proper way to extract is by first steaming the skin (I extract after a steamy shower, though I try not to let the hot water come in contact with my face too much). Then I use a lancet horizontal to my face to make a slight opening at the VERY TOP of the pustule. From there, I stretch back the skin, push slightly down on the skin, and then push gently towards the pustule to release the gunk within. Then I disinfect. I hope this makes sense!


What I should be doing to achieve even clearer skin:

- Drink more water.  I can't get in the habit, damnit! I should also lay off on screwdrivers and wine on the weekends.

- Drink spearmint tea. This is suppose to lower androgens, apparently, and has been found to help with hormanal acne and hirsutism in women.

- Change my pillow case every other night. I really don't know why I haven't been doing this.

- Cut back on carbs and sugar. Sugar is easy for me to cut back on but I love me some bread. :( I also would like to take a couple supplements that help keep blood sugar levels normal. A couple examples include chromium, cinnamon, and n-acetyl cysteine.

- Get more sleep. I should be sleeping now, actually. 

- I could probably stand to use more exercise and less Netflix/video games. I blame this on my boyfriend.

Anyways, here are some before and after pictures. My before pictures really aren't bad. This was taken a few months ago when I was just using differin gel on my face. I consider that to be ""mild"" for me actually. I started using the regimen described.above close to 2 months ago. The after pictures were taken tonight. The right side of my face is 100% clear, just scarring. Left side had just 2 new blemishes near my mouth. Again, lots of scarring. My scarring isn't as bad as it used to be. IPL and pixel laser treatments have helped a lot.

Here's me with makeup. Ignore my expression, I am very tired in this picture, lol.

Though acne sucks, I'll tell you one good thing that came out of it: I'm now a very passionate 
esthetician that works in the same dermatology department I went to when my skin was at its worst. I get to help others with acne all the time, it's pretty awesome. :)

[This blog post](http://theprimalparent.com/2012/03/31/ibs-depression-skin-fructose-malabsorption/) discusses the problem more in depth. [This](http://www.healthhype.com/nutrition-guide-for-fructose-malabsorption.html) gives a table of foods to avoid or to eat in moderation if you have fructose malabsorbtion.

I removed from my diet: all fruit and things containing fructose and all things containing fructans such as onion, garlic and wheat. Whenever I stay away from fructose and fructans my pimples dry out and heal.

Hope this helps some of you. Note: I already had a pretty low carb paleo diet. Keep that in mind if removing fructose alone doesn't do it for you.

I had serious acne. I'm happy it's calmed down in the last year or so (hormones settling down?).

I've moved closer to the coast and try and go to the beach at night. I noticed when my acne on my face started clearing it was as if it started spreading to my chest/back.

I believe acne has ruined my life. I feel self-conscious about my public image. I like 3 day beards because it masks some of the blemishes. 

How should I start this? My diet?

Because I'm in the hospitality industry my diet is usually Fish. Occasionally when family visits I have Mediterranean dishes (lamb on spit, spanakopita, marinated octopus etc). 

I've heard people on the paleo diet see good results?

My job is very stressful. I perspire a lot (usually go through 2-3 shirts a day). I don't wash clothes in any 'sensitive' skin detergents (should i?)

I change my sheets once a week and swap pillow cases every couple of days. I flip them back to front and upside down. 

I've shaved my head. Like with no guard trimmer (see [pic](http://www.men-hairstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/butch-haircut.jpg)). Noticing a slight improvement. Probably because the oils from my hair dont contaminate my skin when I cant wash my face.

I have facial wipes which I use when I don't have time to wash face. 

My current daily routine:

** Morning (before work): **

Have warm shower
- get out shower and apply Cetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser (face, chest, back).
- Rinse in shower, turning down temp gradually to cold.
- Pat dry
Go to room, apply BP cream to 'spots'

** During day **
Go to work and sweat. When rush ends; rinse face with water/change shirts.

** During night **

Go have a shower (repeat morning method)
GO to bed.

I haven't noticed any dry skin yet. 

Shaving.

I recently got gifted a Gillette Sensitive Skin pack, which includes the Sensitive gel and razor. I shave at night. 

I seem to notice my face getting inflamed (razor burn?) the next morning. I know about shaving hair not skin routine, against the grain etc. 

So shaving routine involves:

Get out shower
Apply gel to face
Shave
Apply [Natio after shave balm](http://natio.com.au/men-shaving/calming-aftershave-balm#)

When I wake up my face feels oily and my pores feel open.

I took all of the most popular face masks I could find and threw it together. This along with being sugar-free for about a year has helped me clear up. 

I used honey, lemon juice, yogurt, thyme, rubbing alcohol, CeraVe moisturizing lotion, crushed up aspirin, and salicylic acid. I know how crazy that sounds but it has helped me a LOT. I've tried everything under the sun except accutane, and I am probably never going to try that. I've had acne for about 6 years.

Products I've used: 

Topicals: Zania, Epiduo, Acanya, benzoyl Peroxide, Aczone, and Clindamycin 


Face washes: Clean&amp;Clear, CeraVe, Aveeno bar soap, and a few others I can't remember. 

I have been put on the birth control pill, and Solodyn at one point. 
I want to see if I'm not the only one who goes a little nuts trying to have clear skin. 

So tell me, what do you do to 'cure' your acne?

**TL;DR: Nothing worked after 6 years of persistent acne until my face mask of craziness, and changing my diet to sugar free.**

Quick note: Thank you so much to everyone who has replied and shared their experience. I love to learn more about acne products and treatments so I can find new methods of fighting my acne. I feel slightly more normal now. Obviously, I know other people have acne but I never notice it on people so I always feel like I'm the ONLY one with a problem.

I've tried zillions of ""natural"" products. I literally haven't eaten sugar, wheat, dairy, eggs, ANYTHING like that, in more than 2 years. I eat incredibly healthy (2 green smoothies/day), nutritious salad with alternating fresh cut meats/lunch, I eat a healthy amount of fruits and veggies too. I walk 2.4 miles to school every other day and I always walk home (which is uphill 60% of the way). I live a healthy life style....and I don't pick at my face (even though it feels like I'm on fire 90% of the time). Yet my acne has still persisted...""to hell"" and it ain't getting better. I am m&amp;^%*%ing desperate here. I have never used acutane or anything that harsh but I have used a about 100 other prescriptions like retinal-A etc. 

My goal is to try the caveman-regimen (which I've never heard of till now), for 1 month to see If I make even a MINOR improvement. My acne is extremely Hurtful on my self esteem but being a senior, I have to go to school and bear it all (in a school that seems to have no people with acne as bad as me...really). Even despite the regularity of my routine, My acne changes daily, for the worse and better. It is calm in the morning, but by the end of the day, it's like ""f^&amp;%* that!"" and it turns s*%ty again. So wish me luck, once again, I'm trying the caveman regimen and I'll be updating each afternoon so that you guys can see any improvement. If I do by miraculous chance see an improvement I'll be doing everything I can to make the regimen better known. I should probably mention in a side note that I am not overweight and actually fairly fit (just in case ppl think that might be a factor).

So to summarize my daily regimen will include the following:

Not touching my face or splashing water on it (taking baths to wash my hair not getting my face wet)
Eating healthy as normal (lots of fruits veggies, vitamins that help acne etc+fish ol, primrose etc.)
Going to bed by 9:30 max/night.
Surviving (hopefully).
Daily 2.4 mile walk/exercise

I visited to dermatologist today with my mom (I'm 17 years old, for the record) with intentions of clearing the acne on my face, chest and back. He looked at me, and decided to prescribe accutane, which I was told is a standard method of clearing hardcore acne.

My mom complied as well, we made an appointment to get blood work done on Saturday, and we left. Just now I'd gotten home from work, and my moms on one of those bullshit M.D. websites describing all of the horrendous ""accutane ruined my child"" stories.

I've been noticing something weird with my acne over the years. It began when I was 12/13. I remember my mom bought me something from Avon, a facial exfoliant paste that was blue. When I used it the first time, it made my face tingle and felt like it was actually cleaning it! I thought, this is the end to my problems!

But I just kept getting pimples.

A couple years later I got my first cyst. (At this point I was doing my best to pop all my pimples, due in part to my sister squeezing my whiteheads when I was younger and a horrific nightmare about popping bugs out of my skin. I've always had a severe phobia of bugs.) It started as a pimple and kept growing. I didn't know what a cyst was. I just thought it was a huge pimple and needed to pop it. I mean, I was a teenage girl. I could NOT leave the house with that on my face! I would squeeze and squeeze, but it just wouldn't come to a head.

Then one night while on the phone I'm squeezing it, out of habit at this point, and it explodes. I turned on the light, and my fingers were covered in a slimy pink goop. Oh god it was gross. At the same time it was so interesting that **that** came out of my face. I drained it, but then it filled with blood and part of my face was black for a week.

Fast forward a few years, multiple face washes, and thousands of pimples later. A friend in high school tells me that he hasn't washed his face in weeks. It's shiny and oily but totally clear of pimples. So I stopped washing my face. It worked! Until I couldn't handle the oil anymore and had to wash. Then I broke out once again. 

Since then it seems to be a vicious cycle. Wash face, pimples. Stop washing, oily. Wash face again, worse pimples. I tried various methods of birth control. It would help for a bit then I'd get cysts a few months after starting it. And oh god do I hate the cysts. Painful, red bumps. If they pop they just fill with blood. Some don't drain completely so they heal and you've got lumps under the skin. Ick.

I've tried so many different cleansers, exfoliants, toners, moisturizers. I never got on Accutane, even though my mom got it for my younger brother. I've fantasized about affording microdermabrasion and chemical peels, even once in a dark time wanting to scrub my skin off with sandpaper. :( 

The last thing I'd bought was an Aveeno facial bar. I was sure it was going to work, because Aveeno, all natural, blah blah blah. Well, it didn't. And I was at a loss. I'm 22 now and I don't want acne anymore! 10 years of it is very tiring.

Then I saw a post on here about oil cleansing. Totally makes sense. Using soap and water on your face just washes off the bad stuff and the oil, but then leaves your skin freaking out, going into overdrive to replace those oils. It made sense that you use oil to get rid of oil. Look at Goo-Gone (sorry, best analogy I can come up with).

I have very oily skin and huge pores. I heard mixed reviews about what oil would be best for that combination. I decided to go with olive oil, even though I read it can clog pores. And it worked! I just generously slather it on and rub it in for a few minutes, then wipe it off with a clean, dry washcloth. My face feels so much better afterward, doesn't get oily so fast, and the pimples have almost totally disappeared.

I didn't use it for about 2 weeks due to stressors messing up my life, and started getting pimples again. It wasn't good. But I used it again, and once again my face feels great. I currently have two small zits happening under the skin- because I let my face clog for that two weeks, I think. I'm trying not to mess with them so much.

I just wanted to write this to let you guys know of my semi-success and give you a new option to try if you haven't already. Good luck!

My tongue is incredibly sensitive to spices now. Before, if I had something spicy, my entire mouth would burn all over and it wasn't centralized. I couldn't have the spiciest sauces but I was stronger than the average little white girl. But now it's very different. Buying salsa from the store, I still have to get medium or hot (because mild tastes like ketchup) but everything else burns. For example, I went to a restaurant a week ago and got wings. I'd gone before I was on accutane but when I went this time I couldn't handle the medium spice at *all*. It's pretty sad for me because I love hot sauce and spices.

I just turned 17 and suffered from moderate acne to now little to nothing. First thing is people don't understand how hard it actually is to have acne. It takes way all self confidence and the want to socialise with others. I would hate going to school because people could see my face, not go to parties or make up excuses so I wouldn't go out with friends. Its horrible to deal with. I first started getting acne in March. March 2nd to be exact. One week before this party is how I remember it. Anyways since then I have been on a few medications. Some which worked, and some which made my acne worse. My acne consisted of about 4-5 pimples at a time but big, huge, blood red bulging pimples. I have ocd when it comes to pimples and find it so hard to not touch, so my acne was made worse by me trying to pop them. AnyWays I thought that it was just a faze and would go away. It didn't. So about a a month in I went to my doctor. She said its nothing and it will go away with some otc medicine. I began on benzac 10%. My face got better for a week, then after that it remained the same. I used it till maybe the end of march and still nothing. Went back, the doctor said duac, which is a bit stronger and prescribed. During this time my acne flared. The first week of duac my face remained the same, then my face became so ready, so dry to the point of where I couldn't open my mouth without feeling my skin tear and bleed(a little bit) but anyways after 3 weeks I gave up and then continued using duac with phisohex which actually helped clear my skin somewhat, but my acne was still present. Maybe April, mid April I went to my gp and said doc what can you do. He said my acne was bacterial and that is why it wouldn't go away. She gave me a 6 week course of emycin (oral antibiotic) and 6 subscriptions to EPIDUO. This is where things started getting way better. Within 2 weeks my big pimples were small little barely.noticeable balls of puss under my.skinwhich could be popped leaving no marks and yeah things were going great. About 6 weeks in my face was clear of all pimples, but I began getting ingrown hairs due to me changing how I shaved! SHOWER FIRST THEN SHAVE WITH COLD WATER RIGHT AFTER TO GET NO INGROWNS. Anyways today is the 7th of July and I only have one headless pimple which is getting better caused by the stress of flying to America(I live in Australia so a 14hr flight is pretty hard). Other than that I do have some acne scars and skin discolouration from the scars but nothing serious and is still healing. I have been on epiduo for about 3/3 and a half months and has worked wonders. My daily routine consists of wake up and shower, I wash my face from the previous.nights epiduo with cetaphil gentle cleanser. I shave every 2 days with a 3 razor blade with cold water and use shick sensitive skin shaving gel. I wash my face with just cold water during the day if possible. Then at night I wash my hands with.	cetaphil gentle cleanser, then proceed to wash my face with the cleanser.as well. I dry my face, wait 5 mins then apply my epiduo. I also change my pillow.cover every night. Also to remind myself not to pop a pimple I printed.text off.and stuck in near my bathroom mirror to dittur me from wanting to pop my pimples! I completely stopped eating Lollies and chocolate and try to cut down on fatty foods. Try eat healthily. Also being active and working out is good. There you have it guys. That's my journey. I'm about 95% better now, but I was 100% clear before I left to Los Angeles the stress off the flight gave me that one pimple. So I hope I might have helped anyone in a similar situation and it does get worse before it gets better.

* 16
* Food wise, my diet is not very good
* I drink a LOT of water. A cup with every meal and snack.
* Not oily
* Living in Australia
* Sleep on a clean shirt every night
* Don't touch my face (sometimes I cant help it)

I am not sure what's the deal with my pimples/acne.

I don't get blackheads, and don't usually get whiteheads. They are usually dry, red, bumps on my skin. Sometimes they have a proper head, sometimes they don't.

The only treatment I use is a Clearasil pimple cream, called Ultra Acne Treatment Cream (Extra strength) which contains Benzoyl Peroxide. I use this when I see a pimple forming, or have an existing one. I get a dab on my finger and tap the pimple, only putting a bit on it, then flatten the cream on it. I then may leave it on for a couple of hours and sometimes overnight.

This sometimes and sometimes not can remove the pimple, in about 2-3 days.

The bad thing is, sometimes, my face can become EXTREMELY dry and red. That sort of dry when your face just feels overly tight and is about to split. So basically, its a trade-off, usually. Either have no pimples and red dry skin, or pimples and normal skin. To soothe the dry skin, I try to use Moisturizing fluids (SPF15) and other times natural creams such as paw-paw. These make my skin feel better, but I don't think they help much.

I don't use shower wash's because in my past experience they've made the pimples more red and my face dry (I've tried a couple).

So after doing some research, my guess is that my skin is very sensitive to benzoyl peroxide. I've tried lesser strength and different Clearasil products, which don't affect the skin much, but also don't really mend the pimples/acne.

Having anxiety and social issues, my skin is really important to me to feel comfortable. This is why I go to weird lengths such as using moisturizers (even though I'm a male).

And it's just a never ending cycle, too. Been going on for a year. I'll get rid of the pimple(s) of the week, and another bunch will break out the following week.

I'm honestly not sure what to do. Living in Australia, I don't think I have access to top notch products, and buying online creams for $40 seems a little excessive even for me.

I've heard Salicylic Acid is good for sensitive skin, as well as more natural products. But I'd rather not blow a heap of money searching for that one that is right for me.

Does anyone have any advice/recommended products that are fairly cheap?

Thanks

About a month ago, I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1ecd0f/report_modified_acneorg_regimen_success/) about how I modified the acne.org regimen to great result.  However, as well as it was working, I was getting redness from the BP I was using, as low concentration as it was (2.5%).  I should note that I eliminated 99% of my acne from this, and I've only had the occasional zit since, usually due to something I ate (dairy or so on).  Now, I'm here to report on the tea tree oil regimen I mentioned I'd try in that post.

Regimen Morning:

* Shower with warm water, not hot (hot water isn't good for your skin), at the end of the shower, turn the water cold for about 30 seconds (probably doesn't do much for acne, but it's a good way to wake up)

* Shave

* Mix two pumps of acne.org moisturizer with 4-6 drops of pure tea tree oil.  Currently I'm using Life brand, as it's very inexpensive and lasts a while.  I paid $10 for 50ml, and apply to entire face including neck region.

At night:

* Mix the moisturizer and tea tree oil as described above and apply the same way.

Note, I don't use any soaps here except during my shave.  In my shave, I make sure to avoid the harsh canned crap commonly advertised and I make my own lather with a shaving brush and either a cream or a soap puck.  There are some common ingredients in those canned foams that will strip your skin of its natural oils (for instance Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Sodium Laureth Sulfate).  As we know, this is bad because the skin reacts by overproducing oil to compensate for the dry conditions.  Some great shaving soap I recommend is [Barrister and Mann's](http://www.barristerandmann.com/) line, as the ingredients are readily available and prominently displayed on their website, and aren't harsh at all.  But there are a lot of other soaps that are also very good.  No matter which way you shave, this will benefit you (/r/wicked_edge has a ton more helpful information and is a great community).

So all in all, my regimen is very fast to do.  The acne.org moisturizer is my personal favourite, but I'll bet other moisturizers would work just fine mixed with the oil too, provided they are oil based, as I don't think a water based moisturizer would mix well with the tea tree oil (please correct me if I am wrong).

In keeping with this regimen, I have achieved the same results as before, and the redness has steadily gone down.  About once per week I apply a bit of BP over my skin, but I'm not sure if it's been beneficial or not.  My diet is the same as it was with the BP regimen, I should note, with the same supplements too.  I am experimenting with removing the zinc supplement.

So please, if you haven't, give it a shot!  If anyone is interested, I'll post a picture as proof.",,False,,t5_2qse3,1376359000.0,,,True,t3_1gbb1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1gbb1r/report_tea_tree_oil_regimen_success/,

It's been a while since I've changed my regimen, and I've seen good results during this entire time, so I figured I would share.

Normally, I recommend doing pretty much what it says on the acne.org site (and their products aren't bad either).  Cleanse, apply treatment, moisturize, in that order, twice daily.  Also take 2 fish oil capsules a day.  I found that in doing this, initially, I got good results, but even with a heavy duty moisturizer I was still getting dry skin, and a bit of acne.  I had a theory that the dry skin was actually creating conditions for acne, so I decided to test it by changing my cleanser. (previously using a Swiss-Tec overpriced cleanser that I would not recommend).  I switched to (what I still recommend) Spectro Jel for sensitive skin.  Cheap cleanser, uses very light surfactants, no SLS, none of that.  I found a good improvement, but still some dry skin and a bit of acne.

I was feeling brave, so I decided to cut out the cleanser entirely.  My routine for 4 weeks was simply benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in the morning (acne.org) with the acne.org moisturizer, since I like it so much.  I should note I also began to take 25mg of zinc daily, with a multivitamin (Centrum).  I was amazed.  Within a week, my dry skin problem was completely gone, and so was the residual acne.  I actually had no pimples at all for a 2 week period.  I began to cut back on the BP a bit, using it only once a day, and I still remained clear.  After doing this for a few weeks, I noticed I started to get acne again a bit (probably due to my diet change), so I started using the BP a bit more and it went down again.  This is nice because I can react to changes in my skin rather than bombard it with stuff daily.

With the great success from this, but still getting a bit of irritated skin from the BP, I decided to switch to tea tree oil.  I'm using a different moisturizer now with tea tree oil in it, but I'm planning on buying more acne.org moisturizer and buying some pure tea tree oil to mix in with it, and using that.  I've yet to conclude any results from this, as it's still a relatively recent.  My hope is that I can cut BP out completely and have a simple one-step regimen every morning and evening, and use my cleanser after intense physical activity to clear dirt out (but not on a daily basis like before).

I should note I've been doing working on my acne problem for a long time, with not many solutions working for me.  If you're curious what I've tried in the past:

1) Proactiv solution (was just 5% BP and salicylic acid apparently) (2005-2008)

2) 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, prescribed cleanser, antibiotics (2010)

3) Swiss-tec cleanser, 10% benzoyl peroxide nightly, 5% daily, antibiotics (2010-2011) (I know, harsh)

4) 5% BP, Swiss-Tec cleanser, antibiotics (for a few months)

5) Acne.org regimen with Swiss-Tec cleanser (2012)

6) Acne.org regimen with spectro-jel, antibiotics (2012-2013), occasional face mask

7) Witch hazel and thyme (beginning of 2013)

8,9) What I described in this post

A bunch of little stuff in between with face masks, lemon juice stuff, egg whites, and so on.  No ""natural"" remedies have been effective for me yet.  I did try tea tree oil briefly in 2012 to moderate success, but I also had cystic acne back then too, so that may have skewed things.  I haven't gotten a cyst in a while under this current regimen.

I've had it on my back and face. I recently bought some of this nuetrogena body was and a scrub for a better/deeper clean on my back and its been working pretty well. However for my face I don't know what to try. I've been through a lot of different topicals from the doctor. The thing is my acne isn't really THAT severe, but that makes it just as bad because it contrasts to the areas of my face that are actually clear. I would post pics, but I'm posting this before I leave for work. My acne is a little bit of hyper-pigmentation, but the pimples are bad. My main issue is whiteheads around my temples and my cheeks, and smaller pimples on my jawline. I have VERY oily skin, and my white heads get really big and gross. I'll have around 3-5 bad white heads combined with the scarring/healing ones that are going away. I don't know what to do. It seems like my topicals from the dermatologist irritate my skin. I don't really want to try Accutane because I feel like my acne doesn't warrant that extreme of a solution. That plus the fact that it is almost summer, and I'm outside a lot in the Texas heat.

I've suffered from moderate to severe severe cystic acne (Back, Neck, Chest, Pilondial, Pelvic) since I was about 16. I took Accutane my senior of high school and as you can imagine it wreaked havoc on my skin and my emotions. 

However, after my treatment I was cyst and acne free for a good three years. Everything was perfect and I was so happy that I started to get back in shape, go surfing and running (God I miss being able to run without pain) and generally living a healthier and happier life. Around the age of 20 or 21 my cystic acne came back with a vengeance. I'm not sure it's as bad now as it was in high school but to put things in perspective I had three surgeries last year on one cysts in the pelvic region along with one surgery on my pilondial cyst. The pilondial hasn't come back but the other one comes and goes as it pleases.

My dermatologist (surprisingly) was the one to recommend I try another treatment of Accutane (now called Roaccutane), but I was scared to go through all of that again so I declined. So I've basically been suffering for the last 4 or 5 years (I'm 26 now) and things come and go. Some weeks I'll be nearly cyst free, while others are just the opposite. I've fallen back into not working out, being afraid to take my shirt off in front of anyone, drinking heavily and taking aspirin everyday to numb the pain (yes I know that last part needs to stop immediately, please spare me the speeches). 

For the record I have tried being very healthy and conscious of my skin. For a solid year I ate very clean, cleansed my skin while being on an oral antibiotic and two topical solutions simultaneously (one for morning and one at night), worked out regularly, made sure to get outside once in a while but always wore sun screen (oil free), I used oil free moisturizers after showers, patted my skin dry instead of rubbing it, didn't drink or smoke at all and tried dozens of different oral and topical antibiotics... nothing has worked the way that Accutane worked. Yes being healthier made a slight difference, and when I say I mean sliiiight. Eventually I had them pop back up anyway, that was last year, and as I mentioned before I had three surgeries on one cyst just last year. It just seems like Accutane is my only option now and to make the situation worse I'm on a time limit. I need to make a decision about this asap.

tl;dr version...

I'm going to lose my health insurance next year and simply won't be able to afford being on my own plan. 

My questions are: 

How many of you have had success with a second round of Accutane? 

Would you recommend that I go for it before I'm taken off my Mom's health insurance plan? 

How intense was the second round compared to the first (peeling, emotional roller coaster, etc.)? 

And lastly, how long did it take before you saw improvement (if any) with your skin?

I hope this wasn't too long and drawn out. As many of you can understand cystic acne is a battle and can effect people on a deep emotional level. Sometimes I want to cry when I see how bad people's acne is because I feel there pain. I saw one of the success stories on this board from a guy who had it really bad all over his face and posted a before and after picture. He said Roaccutane was his miracle drug, and that got me thinking that maybe I should give it another go and take my life back.

What do you guys think?

After trying different topical creams and changing contraceptive pills, I have finally found a skin regime to keep my acne at bay using tea tree skin products and not eating too many sugary foods. If I eat a lot of chocolate or sugar one week I may break out a bit, but only a few spots not full blown acne.

Several times a year I visit Switzerland, from England, and find my skin totally breaks out, with spots appearing in the same places each time and then extending over more of my face. I usually have quite oily skin, but what spots i have are usually easily poppable and clear up within a few days. However, while in Switzerland the spots are usually very hard (but not painful) and very hard to pop. When I do manage to pop one it does not clear up during my visit and I have to wait to return to England to heal (which will sometimes be two-three weeks later).

I have tried to work out what environmental conditions are different between the two places. In England I live in a more draughty and cooler house, but in Switzerland I stay in a draught free appartment with underfloor heating, and it is constantly at a warm temperature. The windows are open in the day so there is a fresh flow of air and obviously I go outside, too.

I have also considered different food choices may be affecting my skin. I have had visits to Switzerland where I have eaten all English foods and others when I have eaten all Swiss foods, but my skin has always been terrible.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced the same change in skin and what solutions they have come up with. I should probably add that my skin is only in this condition when I stay in Switzerland - not anywhere else.

I'd tried every remedy going, but my mum, my brother and my sister all had bad acne (thanks genetics). After multiple antibiotics, topical creams, and rounds and birth control didn't do anything, my doctor put me on accutane, and by the time I turned 16, my skin was wonderful! 

For my final two years of high school I was confident, outgoing, and enjoying my life. I still got the occasional small pimple, but it never really got me down. I'm 18 now, and 80% of days, my skin is clear, with maybe one or two small pimples on my jawline. Nothing that a bit of makeup can't fix.

But every so often, once every two months or so, I just get a flare up, nothing as bad as it used to be, not by a long shot, I'm talking maybe 10-15 pimples. They're not cystic, but it wrecks havoc with my confidence. I look in the mirror and I see 12 year old me again. I feel like I don't want to go out, and I definitely don't want people to see me. 

I really don't want to have to cover up with makeup either, the most amazing thing for me once I turned 16 was the fact I didn't have to hide behind makeup any more, and I rarely wear it now. Whenever I do wear foundation all I can think about is how its probably making my acne worse. 

A couple of weeks ago my Pharmacy switched my birth control and assured me it was the same stuff, but that the packaging had been re branded. Since then my skin has been slowly breaking out, more than usual, so I'm wondering if this is what's causing it.

It doesn't help that I'm surrounded by people who have beautiful skin. I don't think my boyfriend has ever had a pimple in the two years I've known him. He tells me I'm beautiful, even when my skin is broken out, and I know underneath that I'm a fairly attractive person, it's just that no matter what I do, I can't have the perfect skin I want. I know it's unhealthy to focus so much of my confidence and my well being on my skin, but I figured if anyone could understand, it would be you guys.

I probably shouldn't be complaining, I should be thankful that most of the time my skin is clear, and I can feel confident showing my skin off now. It's just the days when it really breaks out and I'm left with red splotchy, painful skin that I just want to hide away. When my skin stayed 99% clear for the first six months post accutane I really thought that would be it.

I thought about this for awhile but it's pretty much the last step i'm going to. (I AM NOT CONSIDERING SUICIDE, rather asking for help because my life is shattered due to it...)

I'm 18, and for years I had mild acne that would clear up, come back, get treated, etc and over the last summer I had perfect skin that really boosted my self confidence. I've been told I'm a good looking guy, and have been asked to model before but here comes my problem (I'm sorry if this sounds conceded i'm not trying to be, rather just give a little context). This is my first year at university, and ofcourse I wanted to make a great impression... however as the summer ended and the semester began,my skin outbroke terribly, worse than it ever has before. Over the past 4 months, I tried various creams, proactive, and now I've ended up on accutane that began late november. Although the acne has gotten better, I've never had scarring from acne before despite how much I used to pick at it... but now my face is absolutely covered in red marks and dark marks, as well as blackheads and my confidence is lower than ever.

I'm really not sure what to do tomorrow... the doctor said some of the marks may never heal, and the red marks may take time, but there have been a line of marks on my face that have not changed for months and has driven me really far south... I used to party, enjoy going out with friends, dates, hanging out with girls but now I hide my face, stay in my room, and have gotten back into gaming which I quit a long time ago because it was a bad addiction....

He treated acne patients either with x-rays or vitamin D (viosterol). For the x-ray patients, 48% were much better or healed within 3 months. For the vitamin D patients 75% were much better or healed within 3 months. The vitamin D dosage was estimated between 5000 and 14000 IU daily.

Keep in mind that it was before 1938 

- only the really bad cases would go to the doctor
- diet was probably much cleaner than today
 
I've been taking 1000 IU of vitamin D3 almost daily but things haven't changed much. Perhaps a higher dose, like in the above study, would be better. Moreover, I believe I have traced my problem to [fructose](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/15ip0b/an_apple_a_day_brings_my_skin_decay_its_fructose/), but vitamin D may help other people.

This led me to have a hypothesis that pro-inflammatory diets are a significant cause for acne. In the reverse, having an anti-inflammatory diet with limited pro-inflammatory food consumption should reduce the severity of acne on a person’s face. To support this proposition, I will first examine the main inflammatory dietaries which contribute to acne. I will later examine some anti-inflammatory dietaries which I believe should reduce the severity of acne.

A common inflammatory dietary is consuming dairy/milk products. About 60% of the world’s people are not able to digest milk. For this reason, inflammatory responses are triggered which can cause acne. However, not all dairy products can cause inflammation (i.e.: unsweetened yoghurt).

Another common inflammatory dietary is consuming [refined] sugar products. Sugar is also inflammatory. The more you consume, the greater the chance of it causing acne. A diet with a low GI (glycaemic index) rating would be a good choice for lowering inflammation levels.
There are many other inflammatory dietaries which can cause acne. This includes, but is not limited to: omega-6, alcohol, red meat, and processed meat. Avoiding them can help lower inflammation levels in a person’s body which can reduce the severity of acne.

On the contrary to inflammatory dietaries, anti-inflammatory dietaries can help reduce inflammation in a person’s body which can reduce the severity of acne. Foods/minerals/vitamins high in anti-oxidants such as fish oil/omega 3s, ginger, garlic, green tea, etc. are considered anti-inflammatory. Consuming much of these should reduce inflammation of the body, thus reducing the severity of acne.

Another way to reduce inflammation is to take anti-inflammatory drugs such as Advil or Aspirin. However, I’m not advising anyone to take those drugs as I am not a doctor. One should talk to their doctor before taking any drugs or supplements.

Along with keeping the face clean, a person should try and consume less inflammatory foods and more anti-inflammatory foods. In theory, doing so will reduce the severity of acne.

I recently went through a horrible bout of it - I've got a couple other posts on here - and thought I would share my improvements and the changes I've made.

#1) I've completely stopped popping/poking/pestering pimples.  Unless there is a substantial white-head that is ready to explode on its own, I leave them alone.  It might be unsightly for a little bit, but it really is true when people say that messing with it usually makes it a lot worse.  This is especially true for the cystic acne I was getting on my neck.  I've got one little one now, but after not touching it once, it's not nearly as large or long-lasting as the others were.  Just don't touch your facial area in general during the day - I think this is the biggest factor in my complexion.

#2) Every other day, after using a facial scrub and mild, oil-free cleanser, I apply the AcneFree Therapeutic Sulfur Mask.  You rub it in for about 30 seconds or a minute and then leave it on for 10 or 15 minutes.  Sometimes if I'm busy at my computer I'll leave it on for 45.  It comes in a 1.7oz container, so it looks really small, but I promise if you follow the instructions and use like a dime sized amount, it will last you a long time.  I've been using it for 2 or 3 weeks and it is way over half-full, still.  It is around $8.00 I think?  Anyway, my skin feels really good after it, so even if it didn't take care of the acne I'd still probably use it. 

#3) Every morning and night I use Clean&amp;Clear dual action moisturizer with Salicylic Acid in it on my face, and a Benzoyl Peroxide Gel (10%) on my neck area.  

#4) I have drastically cut down on the amount of soda I drink, and processed sugar in general.  I am unsure if this really makes a difference, but it's a change I've made.  

#5) The last thing I am going to put up here is that I've definitely cut back on a lot of stress in my life in the last few weeks.  I'm in an infinitely better living situation, things are going great with my S/O, and I'm making good progress in my professional life.  Before that, I was constantly on edge, stressed about everything, and just generally unhappy.  I've heard stress is an acne-factor, so maybe this helps too.

In general, and this is much easier to say when its going away, I think ignoring your complexion and not worrying about it too much will help more than anything.  If you're always thinking about it, you're touching your face, you're over-washing your face, you're poking pimples, and making everything worse for yourself.  I am also a firm believer that not one thing will 'fix' your acne, and it will not go away overnight.  Mine did go away pretty quickly, but it was still 2 or 3 weeks.  Here's hoping it stays away, but if it doesn't, I've got more important things to worry about :)  ",,False,,t5_2qse3,1351207377.0,,,True,t3_1217b4,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1217b4/thought_id_throw_my_routine_out_there_fairly/,

I've been ranging from having no acne, to moderate, to severe.  I've been on Accutane twice, as well as every cream and antibiotic possible.  In high school and early college it was definitely the worst.  I've had it come and go,  in general it seems to be getting better, but I've recently had another flareup (I am 24 now). Most are small and might have a whitehead in the morning, but the I have larger cystic lesions on my neck and am getting larger ones on my face.  I assume I am accidentally touching my face a lot during the day, so I am going to be making a greater effort to avoid that.  I was using a moisurizer with salicylic acid in it and I cut that off after (1) it stopped working, and (2) I want to have clear skin without worrying about using a topical product for the rest of my life.  

Has anyone tried Zinc?  I just got a 50mg zinc supplement and plan on taking 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night.  I just took my first one (holy nausea!) and am hoping I see some improvement.

It was always annoying to have but it never really got this terrible. About starting this year, the acne started to go out of control and it started to hurt a lot.

It hurts terribly when I sleep. I have trouble washing my face since it sort of burns when I touch it.

So about two weeks ago, I went to see a dermatologist and he prescribed me with antibiotics. I don't really know much about it but the label says ""TETRACAP CAPSULE 250MG (BEATACYCLINE)(56)"" and I'm taking it four times a day at least half an hour before food.

He gave me some sort of liquid to apply after washing my face. The label doesn't say much, just ""ACNE LOTION (120)ml"". I was instructed to pour some on a cotton and dab on my face. It gets really itchy sometimes when applying but it usually stops itching after ten minutes.

Then there was a cream called ""SAS ACNE CREAM"" and it is supposed to be applied ""on affected areas"" at night before I sleep.

I will be seeing the doctor again tomorrow, but I thought I wanted Reddit's opinion on the matter first.

Here's an image of a part of my face: http://imgur.com/wwyrr. It does seem to be drying a bit but I don't know if it's a good sign.

I've tried a lot of things like putting a fresh towel on my pillow when sleeping and drinking lots of water. I avoided food that people say to cause acne. The doctor specifically told me not to take nuts or anything with coconut oil.

Can you tell me about the medications I'm taking? What should I do? I've been browsing on this subreddit for some time but I didn't really find a solution.

Bonus - you get to look like a sea monster for a few minutes. ,AllyPent,10,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/tn3st/simple_and_cheap_as_hell_way_to_treat_acne/,"Hey there folks.  I thought I would share with you the most effective thing I have ever found for treating acne.  All you need to buy is one thing.  The rest you probably have kicking around the house!

I can't remember where I saw it first, but I remember reading somewhere on the internet about green clay masks.  I was intrigued, but didn't think much of it.  A few weeks after that I was in my local health product store and saw a box of green clay.  [This](http://www.avogel.ca/en/shop/body-care/clay_green.php) one specifically, but it doesn't really much matter.  I thought I would give it a shot.

Holy shit, did this ever help.  I had been dealing with really terrible acne (especially along my jawline area) for quite a while.  A big portion of my acne was those horrible and super painful cysts.  Yuck.  After a week or so of using this wonderful mask almost all of my cysts where gone (or dramatically smaller,) and everything else had cleared up quite a bit.  Fast forward to now and there isn't a spot of cystic acne on my face.  Thank FSM!

For the mask I usually take a Tbsp or so of the green clay and put it in my mixing cup.  I use an old teacup, but it really doesn't much matter.    In order to make it into a paste I usually use apple cider vinegar or just plain old water.  The vinegar works better I find, but I really hate the smell so I usually skip it.  Sometimes I also add a couple drops of tea tree oil.  On the odd occasion I will also add a little bit of a store bought mask, because why not.  

Mix it really well and slather all over your face.  Make sure when you are adding your liquid of choice to add very slowly - you don't need nearly as much as you think you do.  Trust me.

I leave the mask on until it is dried and sort of flaking off.  After that, just wash it off and proceed to your usual skin care routine.  I really hope this helps some of you!

Haven't really been diagnosed but I feel like its the upper end of mild. I'm losing my patience with my regimen of using 2.5% benzoyle peroxide with moisturizer from acne.org because of the mixed results. Sometimes I can enjoy periods of clearness, but not usually and its a constant battle. The problem is compounded by my picking as well. Those thinking, ""stop picking"", well thats probably less likely than a unicorn manifesting in my apt. I do have the capacity to control myself in this respect, but not when constantly bombarded with new outbreaks. Yea, see, I can't even say pimple or zit without cringing, or feeling some shame.

I'm tired of how this condition makes me feel. It affects my confidence daily; keeps me from doing even the simplest of things involving interaction with people (especially job interviews, as I feel being a 27 year old with acne costs me credibility and makes me look immature). I'm an athletic guy, pretty muscular (213lbs @ 12%bf), I feel like i have a decent looking face besides the obvious, nice hair, strong chin and I honestly feel like if i could kick this thing once and for all, i could finally start feeling confident with my appearance.

Sorry for the TLDR, but this brings me to the crux of the matter. I have been to the doctor before (3/4 times since age 17) and its the same, they don't deem me suited for the more ""intense"" treatments because what they see on my they classify as mild and give me antibiotics( which was a ton of pills to take), or a topical regimen that is hit and miss and usually inconsistent. I have flatout asked for accutane in my last 2 visits and have been rejected, that was 2 years ago when I had insurance. I have heard of its effectiveness and feel like its my last true chance to end this blight once and for all. 

This lack of insurance, due to my lack of employment, is why I am considering buying accutane or isotretinoin from mexico. I've read that it is possible to get effectively the same meds if you go to the right places. So I need some help reddit....

Do people know of places to get it across the border in mexico? What would i buy exactly? what dosage is appropriate for me (mild to upper mild acne)? Are there reliable sites that have this information? Is it possible to buy online instead? I think I'm pretty clear on the risks involved, but is there anything I should be especially cautious of?

I really appreciate any help people can provide. Also, I'm sorry but I'm not particularly interested in trying homemade remedies or other regimens that have been effective for others. I'm pretty set on either trying to get accutane or just doing my best with my current regimen.

I am 19, and I am fighting the worst acne that I have ever had. I've had mild acne since I was about 16. I tried proactive for about a year, and that didn't work at all. Then I found out about the acne.org regimen, and started clearing up. I used the regimen for about 2 years and my skin was very clear, and it got to the point where I didn't need to use much of the BP to maintain it. 

About 4 months ago, I ordered cleanser from acne.org since I ran out, and it was around the same time that somebody was going around my neighborhood stealing packages off front porches. So, I ordered my cleanser, and what do you know, it's stolen right off of my front porch. I didn't think it was a big deal, since I was planning on seeing if my face could stay clear without any of the BP treatment.

So for the next month, I was using the Cetaphil facial cleanser and Cetaphil moisturizing lotion on my face that I use for the rest of my body since I've had severe eczema my whole life. For about a month, my skin was alright. I a few bumps here and there that would go away about half a week later. Then whiteheads started showing up, and eventually I was breaking out constantly. I decided to go back to what worked before: the acne.org regimen.

I started off slowly with the BP, and my skin was reacting to the normal side effects. However, I went to Disneyland after about a month of being on the regimen, and my skin has been getting progressively worse for the past two months. I'm on my 9th week now, and my skin looks worse than before I started the regimen! It is incredibly frustrating, and I need some support and guidance.



Here are some pictures:

Yes, I was desperate. So I tried Accutane. I was on it for five and a half months without any problems. Then, one day, while I was on vacation, my stepbrother told a story about a centipede. I started freaking out, because I could not get the image of a gigantic bug out of my head. It was terrifying. I was shaken, and I knew at the time it was probably because of Accutane (as I had never even flinched at bugs or gross things in general before), but I dismissed it and continued taking it. Then, six months in, I started getting continual horrific imagery. Every thought was a nightmare. I would picture my mom's face, and all of a sudden her face would appear in my mind as covered in bugs. All of these intrusive images about bugs, and devastation, and violence, they wouldn't stop. 24 hours a day. I stopped taking Accutane. Then, one day, about a week after the symptoms started, I had an auditory hallucination. It lasted 20 minutes. 

I went home, and saw a psychiatrist. They told me that I was the fourth person this year that had come into their office with my exact symptoms because of Accutane. They told me it would take me six months to feel even close to normal. They put me on a strong dose of antipsychotics and benzos. 

For the next six months I continued to have severe panic attacks associated with psychotic imagery. I took a full year off of school. I lost my vision for about four months before having it come back. My mom had to take a leave of absence from work to be with me. 

Two years later, and I am still struggling. Because of my increased sensitivity to anxiety, and because of a bad interaction with caffeine and alcohol, I now have full-blown OCD. I was a wonderfully happy, bright young person with tons of potential before Accutane. Now, I am so different. I wish for the person I was. I break down regularly because I know my life has been forever changed, because of this drug. 

And guess what? The acne came back. I have it just as bad as I did before, if not worse. 

Trust me, please, this drug is terrible. It ruins countless people's lives. You may think it's worth it- it's not. You may think it won't happen to you, but guess what? It happens to about 10% of people, and that's just psychotic symptoms, that's not even including Chrone's disease or depression. 

It's very, very hard for me to tell my story. It triggers me in so many ways. I've wanted to tell it for so long, but I'm still so afraid of everything. And until recently, I was still so afraid of bugs that even typing a bug's name would set me back weeks. So, here it is. Trust me, trading your life for a temporarily clear face isn't worth it. 

Edit: I thought I was strong enough to do this, but I'm not. I won't be looking at this post again, nor will I be answering any questions about it, especially given the first response to my post. I just have one question to ask all of you who don't believe my story, or who think it's not as bad as I made it sound: Why would I lie? Why would I tell my story to you people, you strangers on the Internet, when it costs so much emotionally for me to do so, if it weren't true.

When I eat a small amount of carbs, I break out about 2 days later. I've tried brown rice, sweet potatoes, spaghetti squash, and almonds, but they all eventually cause me to break out. I started eating pork rinds but they also seem to cause small blemishes a few days later (not as severe, but I guess they are fried with oils that cause me to erupt). 

I'm kind of trapped. Eating a purely meat diet is not really sustainable long term, but my acne has been the source of my depression for the last 3 or so years.

Background: I'm a 27 year old male and I've had acne for about 2-3 years. I've tried benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid to no avail. I can recall off the top of my head trying proactive, acne free, and pronexin. From what I can tell they were too harsh for my skin. After trying so many complicated regimens I'm happy to say i found something simple and effective for me

Treatment:

- [DHC Cleansing Oil](http://www.dhccare.com/DHC/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=300)

- [Tea Tree Oil](http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Essence-100%25-Australian-Tree/dp/B000UJHRKM/ref=sr_1_12?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365019423&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=tea+tree+oil)

- [Cetaphil Moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Cetaphil-Fragrance-Moisturizer-4-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B001ET73D8/ref=sr_1_12?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365019545&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=Cetaphil)

Procedure: The first thing you need to do is cut the tea tree oil since it is pretty strong on its own. I mix it with water in a 10:1 ratio (water to oil) and put it in a dropper bottle. You'll notice the water and oil won't mix so you will have to shake it up before you use it. 

1. Take the DHC oil and put a little pool in your hand (1-2 pumps from the container). 

2. Take the dropper of tea tree oil/water mix and put 3 drops into the pool of oil. Rub it between your hands to mix it up and apply it to your face. 

3. After rinsing thoroughly, do another pass with just DHC oil. I found that any traces of tea tree oil on my face will cause a breakout. 

4. After rinsing thoroughly again, apply the moisturizer and that's it.

Briefly: I ""cured"" my immediate acne at the beginning of the year using saltwater spray/getting more exercise (sweating out toxins)/drinking more water/and eating healthier.

But there's something else that contributed to my cure, more so than I thought possible. Allow me to explain: ever heard old saying ""get your beauty sleep""?

I have, all my life, especially from my parents. Recently I've had a minor comeback of acne which I amazingly got rid of over a 4 day period (Friday-Monday). How? By going to bed REALLY early. On an average school day I would go to bed anywhere from 10-11-even 1 in the morning. But I went to bed at 6 pm and woke up at 6 am (the time I normally have to get up to have enough time to get ready for school). Here were my observations of the days events following this 12 hour/day-night sleep cycle. Keep in mind I did not change anything else (I was sleeping in bed sheets and using a pillowcase I hadn't washed in two weeks)

Day 1 (friday)) I woke feeling extremely refreshed, alert, and calm (unlike jaded and panicky to get everything ready like normal). As I was washing my face realized my skin felt really soft. Especially soft. Like baby skin. Ok...

Day 2 (saturday)) I woke feeling as good as the previous day except my skin looked about 40% better (all I had done was go to sleep earlier). Wow...

Day 3 (sunday)) I woke to yet again to a feeling of amazing refreshment. My skin looked about 60% better. Now this is the day when I would normally screw my skin up the most on as I would no doubt cram and stay up till midnight finishing homework I should have done earlier but alert as I was I finished my homework early and instead of hopping on my computer decided fuck it! I'm getting some sleep tonight.

Day 4(monday) I woke to a mini miracle, my mini breakout was completely gone, my skin felt like baby skin and I felt alert and calm. Woo...

After experimenting a few more times due to a few more mini breakouts from crap food I realized the best time to go to bed is about the time you plan to get up in the morning. But I realized this wouldn't always be possible so I experimented some more and found that if I was fully asleep by at least 8 pm (resulting in 10 hours of sleep), that that was enough to have about the close to the same effect (though not nearly as stress relieving). So now what do I do now? Instead of staying up really late on weekends I get all my fun early in the day so I can get to sleep earlier and it's like a rest-cure for acne, literally. 

Anyhow, sleep is free so if you are totally out ideas and don't want to spend extra money you might consider trying what I did. Keep in mind, the better you are at keeping the sleep consistent the better. I recommend the friday-monday thing so you have at least 4 days of hopefully un-work-pending days to get rest.

It's not enough to really give a description of your past history and your current diagnosis on whether or not you have mild, moderate, or severe acne. A person with mild acne may believe they have a moderate or severe form. For some, they cannot really differentiate between cysts and whiteheads.

I understand that it's hard to take pictures especially at times of low self esteem, but if you're really at a point where you're going online in search for treatments that may work, acne obviously is a big enough part of your life that you would want to track your progress.

I started getting heavy acne during my college years and have struggled to find ANYTHING that remotely helps. I remember years ago when I started to try and actually fix the problem, every new ""treatment"" was a glimmer of hope for me. I would go out and purchase said product or supplements in hopes that it would work. And throughout all that, I took pictures. No, the pictures are not flattering at all, but my hope has always been that I find something that clears my face. And when that time comes I would want to share to everyone at least my experience both through pictures and my history.

Throughout my struggles, it's made it extremely hard to believe that I'll have clear skin again since I've gone through a laundry list of lifestyle changes with no results. Having before and after photos of treatments that are said to work would at least let me know ""Oh, so this is the type of acne this person had, and it is very similar (or dissimilar) to what I have. I should try this treatment that was successful for them"".

IN SUMMATION: If you really have cured your acne through any type of treatment, lifestyle changes, or supplements and want to help out current acne sufferers, please provide some before and after photos (you can block out the eyes and above if you're sensitive to your photo being on the internet) so that people looking for some advice can at least know what this ""cured"" person was dealing with prior to finding the solution.

Tl;dr - **How do people with acne specific food intolerances like sugar, citrus, etc. explain them to people in a respectful and unembarrassing way?**

In the last week or so I've been really hardcore about cutting out dairy, refined sugars, and excess carbohydrates from my diet.  I've prepared nearly all my meals and it has so far done great things for my skin.  I've been eating well for the past while, but I think the elimination of sugars has really made the difference.

Aside from whether or not these benefits will last, I have a new issue: How do I broach the subject of these dietary restrictions?  I'm a 23 yr old male living in a hip neighborhood of Chicago and have friends who enjoy going out.  A no sugar diet to most people I know is completely alien and doesn't go unquestioned if I have to bring it up.  I'd happily keep it my little secret, but when I do eat at a restaurant or go to a friend's place for dinner, I haven't found an unembarrassing/unannoying way to explain myself.  Dairy is easy enough... ""I'm lactose intolerant.""  But people would likely laugh if I said ""I'm sugar intolerant,"" even though it's technically true.  It's not in people's vocabulary.

Any suggestions?  If my acne had completely cleared up, I'd have no problem saying it makes my skin freak out, but as it stands I'd rather not draw any attention to it.  This is especially tricky with the holidays coming up and all of the wonderful homemade desserts I'm going to have to turn down.

I'm a 25 year old suffering from Adult Acne.  So my facial acne is mild at worst, but I have always had bad acne on my back.

I put **salicylic acid** and **benzoyl peroxide** on my face, chest &amp; back; shower one to two times a day.  After showering I pat my skin down with **apple cider vinegar** which is said to restore PH balance of skin, protecting it from further bacterial infections.

This reduces the amount of breakouts on my body, yet the problem is still significant. So what can /r/acne suggest for me? Is there anything in my diet that causes acne?  Dairy products?  Gluten?

My face is clear except for the occasional zit.

Every winter my skin goes into ultra horrible mode though.  Usually it's just very dry and can be kept at least not too painful with lots of moisturizers.   A few patches here and there which moisturizer doesn't even help are normal, a little bit of acne on my back as well, but it goes away once spring comes around.   

Last winter though something changed.

I started getting very bad acne (maybe acne?)  on my back, shoulders, an chest as well as the normal dry skin.   Moisturizers and acne body wash didn't even keep it under control.  It got so bad it's lasted all through the summer as well, and here we are with winter starting again and it's horrible still.   The acne seems to be much larger bumps, and come almost in clusters in certain sections like my shoulder blades, the middle of my back and my shoulders, with smaller bumps all over.

I know it's not a hygiene issue because since I can't even stand skipping a day showering and am a bit of a germaphobe.  My hands suffer the most from my germaphobia though since I wash them way too often drying them out.

I don't know what to do.   I've tried a wide variety of moisturizers, anti-acne body scrubs, cold showers, hot showers, topical cream on the acne and about everything else I read that might help.   I take vitamins every day, drink lots of water, exercise 6 times a week and am fairly fit.     

I even tried sun lamps hoping that getting some ""sun"" might help!   Only thing that did was tan my arms, face and feet since I'm fair skinned and don't tan most other places very well.  I don't burn very easily though.

Nothing has helped so far.     I'm reluctant to see a dermatologist because I'm so embarrassed by how it looks, but I'm scared to death about how bad it's going to get in the winter if it's already this bad now!  

Is this even acne or does it look like something else?    Any one have any suggestion on what else I could try?    I'm desperate and out of ideas...

Here is a picture of one of my shoulder blades.    This is just a small patch of it.  It looks much worse if you could see my entire back and shoulders.

I've had acne on my chest badly for close to 8 months now. I have tried several treatments to address it, from benzoyl peroxide in varying concentrations, to 2% salicylic acid scrub and 20% salicylic acid peel. I have tried minocycline and amoxicillin to address it, to no avail. I had been on doxycyline for quite a while, and when i switched to minocyline (doxy had begun to give me lack of appetite) was when it first started to break out. I would go back to doxycyline, but my dermatologist said that antibiotics do not help clear acne, but merely suppress what you have. I don't want to waste my time anymore. 

Currently i am using a clay mask called Lerosett, and while it worked somewhat on my face, i haven't seen any results on my chest. I have also been taking zinc and vitamin D supplements for about a week now, because i heard that that is suppose to help with acne.

To further describe the picture, most of my chest acne is not whiteheads or blackheads, but rather red / pink bumps and slight hyperpigmentation. What should i be trying to heal this completely?

Let me describe my situation. I am nearly 21 years old and have been going to the dermatologist for acne since I was about 14. I had kind of under control through the use of antibiotic pills and creams, but just a few months ago, I decided it would be a good idea to try and end antibiotics and see if I could get by without them. BAD IDEA. The acne flared up like crazy and I had to make an appointment with the doctor. The only crappy part was they were scheduling six weeks out so I requested a one month supply of the junk I've been using because I COULD NOT wait that long. Luckily, he okayed my request and I've been using the same antibiotic pills and creams I always have.

It seemed to help, but not like before. Maybe I'm just impatient or paranoid, but I got this terrible nodular pimple on my jaw line. I at first got it to downgrade to a regular pimple, but yesterday it flared up and is back at a nodular stage. That's the big one on top of the rest of my face and the back of my neck. I just can't take it anymore! I can't handle anymore disappointments. I'm slowly going crazy and on the verge of completely losing it! I can't stand to look in the mirror because I HATE who I see. 

Making matters worse is I have a gf now (who I asked out when my face looked half way decent) and I just feel the pressures of that on me. How can she love me and be proud of me when I look like this? It gets so so so hard on me. Even more is I'm a university student and when I sit in these auditorium classrooms with like 150 others, I am the ONLY one in this situation. I'm all alone. Does anyone know what that's like? It's really taking its toll on me and just eating me alive.

So I must ask the question. At this stage with where I've been and how I'm feeling, is it time for Accutane? My doc tried getting me on it a few years ago, but I resisted because of the fear of the side effects. I still fear the side effects, but I don't think I have a choice anymore... I'm starting to cry as I type this. I don't know what to do anymore. And from what I hear, going on Accutane is a humiliating process in itself. It's bad enough to have to use it, but going in for monthly blood tests sounds nuts. Does anybody know what they are checking for with the tests?

Does anybody else have experience with it? Another thing too is I am still with my mom for health insurance so I need to win her over and try to convince her of the med's safety. If I was on my own, I think I would just do it. So if anyone has some pointers there, that would be nice.

Aloe Vera - Buy one of these plants, and chop off the a stalk from near the stem. There is a clear gooey gel inside and these work great for cuts, and acne. Apply over affected Areas.


Oatmeal - Use this as a mask or a cleanser. Just grind up the oats and add a little water to it. When you saturate the oats in your hand with water, don't waste the milky liquid from it and just apply it on your face! Oatmeal can soothe and heal the skin, while reducing inflammation and redness at the same time. Rub over face and rinse well as this may get a little messy (but worth it!)

If you don't grind them , they can be a little rough but that's good for exfoliation. (Or you can saturate them with water a bit more to further soften them).




Lemon - Great for giving your skin elasticity, lightening some acne scars and getting rid of acne and brighten up the skin. Try not to use this too often as it can be too drying for your skin

After cleansing, Put some lemon juice on a cotton pad and begin to  run it over your face, and let it dry for 5 minutes, and rinse it off. The disadvantage of this is that it can sting or burn to some people, but you get used to it after a bit.

If the lemon juice is too much to handle, you can always dilute it with some water and just cleanse your face with it. Works the same way. 

Drink lemon juice straight up (with a straw so it doesnt come in contact with your teeth) or maybe just add some lemon juice to water. Helps



Green Tea - High in antioxidants, taste might be a little weird to some of you though. Drink or apply on face.


Tea Tree Oil! - This is a natural antiseptic but don't use the body shop brand as it is very uneffective compared to the other more concentrated brands. Make sure you buy this undiluted, and apply on blemishes with a q-tip. Quite strong if you are using 100%, so just use it in moderate amounts. 



Lemon Sugar Face Scrub - Cleanse face, Wet face slightly, apply sugar over face, put lemon juice on a cotton pad, massage gently over your face for a gentle exfoliation. Sugar is a little better for exfoliation is because most of the granules are round. 



Honey - Great natural mild antiseptic! Rub 2-3 teaspoons on your face and leave on for 5 minutes to let the sweet substance do it's stuff. Rinse off. 



Apple Cider Vinegar - Best to use natural and organic for this (as well as all the other listed remedies) Use it as a toner at full strength without diluting if you can. 



Get a cup of water, add 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, and 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Drink this 2-3 times a day.



Try to acquire these ingredients that are from an organic brand. It may work better.

1341903314.0,7,self.acne,wbfbd,Budget Acne Guide For Oily Skin And Cystic Acne,,10,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/wbfbd/budget_acne_guide_for_oily_skin_and_cystic_acne/,"Hey there, Reddit! I had really bad acne throughout all of high school. It was terrible for me. My senior year, I went to see a dermatologist, and a year later, I have been acne free for over three months! Not a single breakout. I've been to the dermatologist plenty over the past year, and I'd like to share with you all what I've learned. Acne is not something that anybody should have to live with. That's why I've put together this guide, with the help of my dermatologist. Just because you can't afford a dermatologist or expensive medication, doesn't mean you can't get the same results!

If you have oily skin and suffer from acne, odds are your biggest problems come from those buggers underneath the skin. This is the same problem I had. The acne is forming because the oil, combined with dead skin cells, cause infections. The solution is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! You want to speed up cell turnover on your face. Here's how to do it, really cheap.

1. Use a St. Ives or generic peach apricot scrub as a cleanser, such as this one: http://www.amazon.com/St-Ives-Sensitive-Apricot-6-Ounce/dp/B00005IBW0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341903407&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=st+ives+peach+apricot+scrub When you wash your face, scrub for 2-3 minutes with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel. ALWAYS use a clean towel. I use paper towels to dry my face because they are always clean and convenient.

2. Now that the dead skin cells are gone, the next step is to get rid of the acne causing bacteria. Facial cleansers do not get rid of bacteria. This is why dermatologists prescribe antibiotics and antibacterial face washes and lotions! However, there is a very cheap alternative, which is tea tree oil. This is very cheap: http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Tea-Tree-liquid/dp/B000ELP5KA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341902616&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tea+tree+oil What you want to do is mix 1 part tea tree oil with 6 parts water. Put the mixture in a container or something. After you wash your face with the scrub, grab a clean cotton ball and spread the tea tree oil mixture over your face. Let it dry. The tea tree oil kills bacteria and controls your skins oil production!

3. Moisturize. Always moisturize. Moisturizing will help control the oil production on your face. In the morning use an SPF 15 sunscreen such as this one or its generic brand: http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Moisture-SPF-Ounce/dp/B000052YP1/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341902998&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=neutrogena+spf+15 Be generous. The ingredients in sunscreen not only protect your skin, but give your face a matte finish which controls shine and oil on your face. It's also won't clog your pores! At night, use a moisturizer that contains salicylic acid, such as this one: http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Clear-Oil-Free-Moisturizer-4-Ounce/dp/B000052YJM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341903155&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+and+clear+moisturizer Salicylic acid is great at night because it will continue to speed cell production.

4. Never, ever, ever touch your face. This is critical! With oily skin, one touch, even from scratching, can spread bacteria to your face and it will seep into your pore and cause a breakout! Don't wipe your face with your hand, and don't even scratch your face. If you must touch your face, wash your hands first, or use a kleenex/paper towel as a barrier. It sounds a little extreme, but it is very important.

So there you have it! With those 4 products, you can simulate everything a dermatologist would prescribe to you, at a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the cost. Just be sure to do this day and night. It works so well, I don't even purchase my expensive prescriptions anymore!

Where to find:
Peach apricot scrub at any Walgreens or Target.
Tea tree oil at any Whole Foods or Trader Joes. Check the organic section of your supermarket. Or just order it online.
SPF 15 moisturizer at any Walgreens or Target.
Salicylic acid moisturizer at any Walgreens or Target.

Before this I had tried everything, including:

-All sorts of over the counter creams/washes

-No more dairy

-Changing the pillowcase every night, or wrapping it in a fresh towel

-Changing up the frequency of how often I apply creams

-Lowering the amount of wheat I consume

-Completely eliminating fast and fried/oily foods

-Cold showers


Guess you just have to find out what works for you. If you have an acne problem and you also masturbate every now and then, try not masturbating for a couple weeks and see if there's a major improvement...obviously worth a try.

A little bit of background: I've had pretty bad acne since I was about 12. Like, my face and upper back were absolutely covered. It was pretty depressing an not good at all for my self image. 
Anyway, I went on Accutane when I was about 16 at 80mg/day. The only real adverse affects of the drug in the first few months were very dry lips and face and mild stomach irritability, not really as bad as I thought it would be after reading a few boards about the drug. 
Anyway, about 4 months into my treatment, I started to feel nauseated 24/7 and was getting into a very depressive state (also have previous issues with clinical depression). Also, many joints (shoulders, knees, hips, base of skull) would hurt all of the time(on a scale of 1-10, I'd rate the constant pain at a 6-9). This has been going on for 4 ish months (to present day). I haven't been able to keep any food down for 2 months and I've been living on crackers and very bland food. I am 100% convinced that this is due to the Accutane after reading a few forums about adverse effects. Oh, and another thing: all 3 of my blood tests (one starting the medication, one at 1 month and another at 2 months) were all come tell normal. My doctors said that I looked healthier than they did. 
Anyway, I guess I just wanted to tell you all that if you're considering Accutane, do a LOT of research and make sure that you understand the risks. It has definitely cleared up my acne a lot and I'm seeing my family doctor tomorrow. If you are already on it and are noticing the early adverse effects, I'd urge you to talk to a doctor and look it up online. 
I've read that there's also a lot of bowel problems sometimes 1-5 years after finishing the treatment. 
I just want you all to know what you're putting into your body! Stay safe guys.

I have had acne problems for a while. I took medication for it that worked, but it made me incredibly suceptable to getting roasted by the sun no matter how much sunscreen I put on. Then I finally found a face cleanser that worked (cetaphil gentle cleanser) and didn't dry out my face. I used this for a while and everything was going great. One day, what seemed randomly, my acne came back really badly and I couldn't get rid of it no matter how many precautions I took and how well I took care of my face .

Eventually I realized that the only thing that was new to me was that Mio water additive stuff. My roommate got some of it and didn't like it, so he gave it to me. I used it with practically every glass of water I drank. I looked at the ingredients and the big thing that stood out to me was sucralose right in the middle. Typically I'm used to seeing it as the least-used ingredient on any product. I kept my diet the same and stopped using the Mio. My face eventually went back to how it was before I started using it. I would say that sucralose might not be the cause, but I've read a couple articles online that pointed to acne being caused by sucralose.

This is my first reddit thing, after browsing for a month and not saying anything :3

My acne started when I was 13. It wasn't just a pimple, it was that big painful stuff, and it was all over my chin and jawline. I tried all over the counter products, popular homemade remedies, and still nothing. 
I finally sucked up my, ""it will go away next week!"" attitude and went to see a dermatologist. He prescribed me doxycycline(sp?) and ziana gel. The cysts went away, holy carpfish. It had to get worse to get better, yea? So my cheeks were covered with whiteheads instead. But then, my skin was clearer than ever, perhaps with maybe a few whiteheads left on my chin. How miraculous! I stopped taking the medication, yea- stupid, because I was just happy with what I had. 
I think taking the full course would have cleared all of it, but pimples still come back and I want them gone because they're coming every day and marking up my skin and making me sad.
**tl;dr- took doxy + zania after 6 years of cysts- cysts went away, stopped taking doxy without finishing course, whiteheads persist.** 

It's really not that bad, and is easily covered up with makeup (which I'm sick of doing every day). However, the acne is always in one spot, which I find strange- it is always on my chin on the far left, under and to the side of my mouth, and tapers off to my left cheek, but never on or over the cheekbone. Anyone know what that might mean, if anything? Cos it doesn't go anywhere else, really.

My daily routine goes something like this:
*wash face with warm and cold water in the morning, respectively 
*wash face with Neutrogena acne wash in the evening (because I am probably wearing makeup)
*mostly vegan diet (started three weeks ago)- the only animal product I eat are fish and honey
*exercise every day; wash afterwards 

What should I do? See the dermatologist again? Or do you guys have some fancy tricks that worked for you?

thanks!

My acne has gotten worse since these were taken and I finally made an appointment with a derm and went yesterday. A little background: I've had acne since I was probably 13 or 14 (I'm 20 now) and it was severe and cystic basically ages 15-17 but has been ""better"" for a while. Yesterday was my 3rd time going to the dermatologist. The first time was when I was 15 or 16 and I got prescribed Yaz, which helped a little bit for a while. The second time was when I was 18 (about a year and a half ago) and I was prescribed Retin-A micro (the lower dose) and clindamycin gel. These helped a lot but I didn't refill when they ran out because I didn't have the money. I've also tried Proactiv, apple cider vinegar, all sorts of crazy diets (no dairy, no water with meals, etc.), the acne.org regimen, every drugstore cleanser under the sun, and many other methods. 

Yesterday the derm put me on minocycline (100mg x2/day) and gave me a bunch of retinoid samples to try. I have both doses of retin-a micro, and both doses of tazorac in cream and gel forms (6 tubes total). She told me to find the strongest one I can tolerate- she said people with sensitive skin tend to have trouble with Tazorac but that Taz has better results if you can tolerate it. For the last 2 days I've been using the Tazorac silver (0.05% I think) cream and will see how my skin does on that for a couple weeks. Once I find the one I like she said I can just call and they'll phone it in to the pharmacy. She said that we can expect to see full results after about 3 months which is when she'll follow up with me. If this doesn't work I will be a candidate for Accutane which is really not what I want but could be the best/only solution to my problem. So yeah, if anyone here wants me to post regular updates on my progress I will. I've also had acne for a very very long time so if you want any advice on treatments, covering up acne, or getting to the dermatologist I can tell you what I've learned through my own research and experience. 

Anyway, [here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/fSuIO) with a couple pictures of my acne and a pic without makeup (which is a very big deal for me- I haven't left the house without makeup in about 5 or 6 years). There are also a lot of regular makeup pictures to show you what I look like in ""real life"". I realize I'm probably going to get recognized at some point but I've kind of just concluded I don't really care anymore. My skin is what it is and I've been dealing with it for a very very long time and I guess I care more about helping other people deal with it than keeping it a giant secret. My acne- especially when it was severe and cystic- was really really hard for me growing up and I hated feeling like I was the only person dealing with it. I can honestly say I never felt ""pretty"" or confident in middle school and maybe only a handful of times in high school. SO sorry about the huge wall of text, but yeah, enjoy!

Prior to that nothing worked except for Accutane. Accutane is pretty harsh, and yeah it works, but I'd have to go back every couple of years. My doctor always wanted blood tests and stuff.

My severity: I'd say pretty bad, consistent and all my life. I didn't quite have it as severe as you see - with huge red cheeks and stuff. I'm a 34 year old male btw.

Yeah the only thing that has ever helped was switching to gluten-free low carb diet. And when I say low carb I mean low carb. Less than 20g a day (besides fiber) is ideal. It's the only thing I've ever been able to do about it besides Accutane.

Here's some science. Do you all know WHY Accutane works? Accutane limits sebum production by the liver. Sebum is your skin oil that you always hear about. Lower sebum = lower skin oil = no acne. That's why if you've ever taken Accutane you know how your face feels? Or if you pick or squeeze at something it bleeds way easier? Or how your skin on your nose is all weird and rough? That's why, no sebum.

Carbohydrates and blood sugar levels: The key too all of this is the glycemic index. If you don't know what the glycemic index is then you need to google or wikipedia it but briefly; the rate at which food items effect blood sugar levels, as compared to straight glucose, are given a rating on an index. Glucose is set to 100. Something like Maltodextrin, which 'burns quicker' or effects blood sugar levels more rapidly than even straight glucose - its rating is 103. Pork is 0 and on it goes. Grain based carbs and flours are all in the 80+  range iirc.

Interesting tid-bit: 5 tablespoons of table sugar will spike your blood sugar levels less than 2 pieces of organic whole-grain bread - and the gluten free flours are even worse. I think Tapioca starch is a 93 or something like that. A Mars bar will effect your blood sugar less than 2 slices of the same multi-whole-grain bread - in terms of the spike in your blood (over the same time interval)

So what? Well, the body regulates blood sugar (blood glucose btw) levels with insulin. You flood your body with carbohydrates which gets super quickly converted into blood-glucose and then your liver floods your body with insulin to deposit that energy where it does. This is the diabetic thing - their body doesn't produce insulin well (for whatever reason) and you have to do it yourself. That's why diabetics can't eat grapes and candy and apples and stuff; those items spike the blood glucose levels too much and too rapidly and ... I don't quite know exactly why but some how all of that leads to diabetic coma.

Now, you've eaten all those easy to digest carbohydrates and your body is responding with an insulin spike to match. So that's good, now your blood glucose is where it should be because the insulin has it all stored (as fat btw), but what does it do with the left over and rest of the insulin?

The liver converts extra insulin into sebum ( I think among other things too). That's the kicker. It converts it to sebum! So you're spiking your skin oil levels all the time if you think about it. If you can regulate your blood sugar levels with your diet you are regulating your skin oil levels. And it works! At lest, it is for me. And I'd happily debate with anyone (and have). If someone suggested it wasn't working for them I'd check to see just how much their carb intake really is.

One provision is milk. I'm not quite as clear on the science of why milk effects insulin and sebum but it has to do something with... milk contains something called insulin-like growth factor (or something like that) and your body handles that stuff similar to glucose - with an insulin spike to convert to fat. I know if I go too hard on the milk, cheese, or cream then I get a flare up (interestingly it seems to be on a time delay of over 24-ish hours later, and will last 2-3 days after that depending on my discipline during that time window). The milk issue may also be related to lactose, which is essentially milk sugar. Either way, cows milk and products effect insulin levels - I'm not sure about other milks like goat or whatever. You can look them up on the glycemic index. Interestingly, butter is low on the glycemic index so just the fat itself is okay in that regard I guess. I personally think I have to take it easy with cheese, in terms of my skin, but I haven't seen a direct ""I ate too much cheese and now 2 days later I have flare ups"" incident yet. I have seen that with heavy cream and 2 separate ""fk it, I'm eating a bunch of Lindt chocolates during my days off"" incidents.

Source: Initially I read a book called ""Wheat Belly"" which I think is pretty popular. It has a whole chapter called ""bagel face"" that tells you what I just said.

I have naturally oily skin that is prone to scars and not wearing the mask isn't an option. 

I would probably still be breaking out if I didn't have to wear the mask, but it wouldn't be as bad. Aside from constantly changing masks, is there anything else I can do to limit breakouts? Anyone have experience with this?

1362166288.0,6,self.acne,19h9hv,What worked for me!,amiraclelife,6,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/19h9hv/what_worked_for_me/,"I'm still in the process of healing my acne but I thought I'd share some of the things I've tried that have been helping me.

1) Honey (cinnamon) mask. This is specially great if your acne is mostly a bacterial problem. Although my acne is mainly a hormonal issue, honey has been great in helping with inflammation and reducing the size and redness of my pimples. Also, my initial months of birth control gave me cystic acne and honey really helped in reducing the size and pain of them. I add cinnamon most of the time, and I've noticed it's helped with white heads too. Although most people will leave it on for 20-30 minutes in the morning and at night, I will admit that I have left the honey mask on for a few hours on my face. If you're not allergic to it and you can handle the stickyness (and the mess that may come with it) I'd recommend it. This is great for people with sensitive skin too, though the cinnamon might cause irritation, so be careful.

2) Aloe vera. I bought a bottled (natural) one but I've heard great things about people who use it straight from the plant as well. Now this tip is for the patient ones. Aloe vera gel DOES help with acne scars, but it takes a little bit of time - and you have to use it daily. I use in between honey masks (so I leave it on during the day) and before applying make up on. This also helps relieve the itchiness and dryness that may occur with acne.

3) Overnight mask. I've tried leaving on the honey mask overnight but found it to be extremely messy. So what I do now is mix the honey with aloe vera gel. The gel makes the honey way less sticky and it's worked really well for me as an overnight facial. I have added cinnamon as spot treatment in this and when I wake up the inflammation is significantly reduced. 

4) Before applying the honey mask, I wash with an acne cleanser (I use a Neutrogena cleanser). I do the same at night. Don't overwash or use too many harsh chemicals on your face. I've found that the over the counter products (like proactiv) haven't worked too well for me, and when off of it my acne returns. Since going more natural (while still using a cleanser, though), I've seen more progress in my treatment. 

5) SUPPLEMENTS!! I cannot stress how important this is and how much it helps with skin problems. I'm currently taking a multivitamins pill (with Zinc - which is extremely helpful with acne), Flax seed oil (source of essential fatty acids - IMPORTANT!), Omega 3, and vitamin D separately. This is all essential, even for those without acne prone skin - since we usually don't intake as much of these nutrients in regular food as we should.

6) WATER! WATER! WATER! I can't tell you how many times I've read about the importance of drinking 8 cups of day but failed to follow it. Ever since I've gotten more strict about my acne regiment, I've made sure to always keep a bottle or cup of water by my side. 

7) Changed my diet. I cut sugar out completely. This is really hard, I know, and I admit to have cheated a couple of times. But my diet includes no soda, sugary drinks (I've traded juices for water at lunch and dinner, though you don't have to if your juice is all natural), only eat whole wheat bread/pasta/rice/etc, less dairy intake (this has been linked to acne flare ups, so I would suggest you cut it from your diet and see how your skin reacts to it), no junk foods obviously (including fried things). Be mindful of salty foods too. 
Remember: 
Refined carbs/sugar = more insulin = more hormones = more sebum (oil) = more bacteria = more acne.

8) Birth control. I'm still in my third month of the pill, and I have to say my acne HAS gotten worse. This is completely normal so don't freak out. Your body has to get used to this new balance of hormones, and it may take longer for some. I'm on Yasmin birth control, which has been praised for helping women whose acne is related to hormonal issues. I'm starting to notice a slight improvement, so I'm sticking to it. 

EDIT: My dermatologist will be putting me on oral antibiotics next month. A friend of mine is also on it, and since he started he's told me he hasn't gotten any new acne lesions. 

I know this is a bit long, but I hope it helps in some ways. Please feel free to ask me anything and I'll gladly answer!

I've finished my 2nd week on doxycycline 100mg, once daily. Last week after some advice from both [ExorciseDaily](http://www.reddit.com/user/ExorciseDaily) and [Inequilibrium](http://www.reddit.com/user/Inequilibrium) on my last log I have started using Benzoyl Peroxide 5% only at night and I think im starting to see results especially in contrast to last weeks breakout. At the moment I think I have one active pimple if that, the rest are all healing and the faint scar marks are starting to fade away. 

Heres a picture of my face at the moment: http://i.imgur.com/TRtTWbmh.jpg

No side effects present at all, the heartburn I talked about last week has gone after I started taking the pill in the middle of my meal and with a lot more water. I've also, starting this week, decided to start eating a lot healthier and drinking a LOT more water. I've found i've already become less lethargic in general and eating healthy can never be bad for your skin either so we'll see how that goes!

I take a multivitamin every day (2500 IU of Vitamin A; 120mg of vitamin C; 800 IU of vitamin D; 30 IU of vitamin E; 25mcg of vitamin K; 2.3mg of vitamin B1; 2.6mg of vitamin B2; 30mg of niacin, 3mg of vitamin B6; 400mcg of folic acid; 9mcg of vitamin B12; 300mcg of biotin; 10mg of pantothenic acid; 300mg of calcium; 18mg of iron; 50mg of magnesium; 15mg of zinc, 20mcg of selenium; 2mg of copper; 2mg of manganese; 120 mcg of chromium).    
I also take an additional 50mg of zinc, 10,000 IU of vitamin A, and 800 IU of vitamin D on top of that.    
In the morning, I rinse my face with warm water, then apply a moisturizer. When I get home in the afternoon, I will either wash my face with soap (it's that Grandma's acne bar thing) or do a honey mask. At night, if my face isn't already clean, I'll wash it. Afterwards, I use AcneFree's sensitive skin toner and the benzoyl peroxide cream.    
Once a week, I do a turmeric mask and/or aspirin mask. Every other week, I'll do an oil cleanse.    
I generally eat a somewhat healthy diet. I get a decent amount of physical activity.     
I'm taking better care of my skin that ever, yet my skin has become worse than ever before. Cystic acne, whiteheads, blackheads, you name it. I literally have over a hundred dark red scars, and every day I get more.    
It's literally to the point that as soon as I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I want to die and I'm fighting back tears. People assume I'm dirty. Nobody wants to get near me, like I have some sort of disease.     
My parents won't take me to a dermatologist, and there's no way in hell I can afford to go see one on my own.    
I have no idea what to do, and every day it gets worse and I get more miserable.    
I've tried dried herbs on my face, oatmeal, hydrogen peroxide, strawberries, eggs, everything (not all at once, obviously). Nothing has helped me.

1360378019.0,5,self.acne,1867ig,16/M Starting Accutane ,GoodbyeAcne,7,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1867ig/16m_starting_accutane/,"So I started Accutane about 3 weeks ago, figured I'd make a post to get some more info about what I'm doing as my Dermatologist hasn't said much and cuts off my appointments once my 'time' is up, sadly.

Here's my routine:

Accutane:

30mg pill/twice day

Shower:

Dove soap w/moisturizing (for face)

Before sleep:

Wash face (just water)

Apply Mary Kay night cream (all over face)

Chapstick 

Sleep:

Towel on pillow, flip every 3 days

Any things that I'm using that could be bad for my skin? Most of them are pretty simple, almost all are based around moisturizer... I know not to drink while on Accutane. Been avoiding greasy foods, like always. Hoping my 6 months goes by fast. I know about how the first 2 months go, 3rd and 4th, and so on are supposed to go, not really worried.

With that said, anything I should know? Literally all that I have written above is what I am doing, I know nothing else and given the amount of work I see some people put into their Accutane treatments I'm a bit worried.

No real bad habits on my part when it comes to my acne, my back is my main problem, my face had a few bad breakouts the first 2 weeks but it's been pretty stable so I'm hoping my next month goes well, my Doctor said I should see results a bit earlier on my face because my acne wasn't that bad to start with.

I do have a few questions however, with the Accutane not mixing with alcohol, does that mean any alcoholic drinks? I take Nyquil pretty often before I go to bed, bad idea? What about non-alcoholic drinks? I take a regular protein shake that has creatine in it, no problems thus far. Also I'm a little more worried about the dark spots/scares on my face from my old acne more than any of my new acne. Anything I could start rubbing on my face to make them less obvious? They aren't bad I'm just worried when all my acne is gone it will be easier to see them so I figured why not start getting rid of them now.

EDIT:
Hot showers bad for dry skin, right? So I am trying to get used to colder water.

EDIT2:
SHAVING! Give me all the details, never shaved around acne just let it grow out until I know it's safe for me to put a razor to it.

Product after product, prescription after prescription, nothing worked. Now, I don't want to jinx it, but my skin has never been this clear and it's all thanks to Exposed Skin Care and vitamins! 

For those of you who aren't familiar with Exposed, it combines all the science-y ingredients like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid with natural ingredients like passion extract, green tea extract, tea tree oil, and I can't even name them all. If it's a known acne fighter, it's somewhere in these products. You may be apprehensive about it, because thats a shit ton of ingredients going on your face every day. For those of you with sensitive skin like me, don't even worry. Somehow this stuff is gentle and strong. I highly recommend it. I use the expanded kit. 

In addition to using Exposed as directed, I take a lot of vitamins and doxycycline 100 mg. The supplements I take are Pantothenic Acid 1000mg (4 a day) Zinc for Acne* (2 a day) and Vitamin D 5000 IU (1 every other day). I got them all on Amazon for about 5 bucks a bottle

Exposed doesn't help with scarring or hyper pigmentation, but I deal with that with the tiniest bit of foundation (To those who are curious, I use Dermablend medium coverage liquid foundation which is about 30 bucks at Macy's). Most people can't even tell I'm wearing makeup. My skin is absolutely fabulous. I get so many compliments on it now.

I took Roaccutan for six months twice (at the age of 17 and 22) and it helped for a short time, but the acne returned about a year later both times... 

I started experimenting with zinc and other dietary supplements about two years ago, and I think I finally found the combination that works out for me. 

I read a lot in this subreddit, and it really motivated me, so maybe I can give something back with this post. I'm german, so all products I linked below are from german drugstores and pharmarcies, but I think it won't be to hard to find corresponding products in other countries.

**Supplements I Use:**

* [silicia (350mg)  + zinc (5mg)](http://www.dm.de/cms/servlet/segment/de_homepage/dasgesundeplus_home/dgp_produkte/dgp_produkte_pharma/dgp_produkte_pharma_schoenheit/36756/kieselerde-zink-kapseln.html) 3x2 per day
* [fish oil](http://www.dm.de/cms/servlet/segment/de_homepage/dasgesundeplus_home/dgp_produkte/dgp_produkte_pharma/dgp_produkte_pharma_herz_kreislauf_cholesterin/36576/dgp-omega-3-kapseln.html) 2x1 per day
* [zinc (25mg)](http://www.shop-apotheke.com/arzneimittel/6890727/zinkorot-25-tabletten.htm?expa=gob.csv_6890727&amp;campaign=googleBase/gob/Zinkorot%2025%20Tabletten%20%28100%20St%29-6890727) 2x1 per day

The first two supplements are from a drugstore (dm) and not very expensive. I tried to replace them with more expensive products from a pharmarcy some month ago, because I thought that they would have a better effect, but was disappointed. I paid much more and had a worse effect.

I buy the zinc capsules (third one) at an online pharmarcy. 

You see, I take a high amount of zinc per day (~80mg). I don't know if this is risky, but I do not notice any problems (until now...).

**Other things I do:**

* wash my face every morning and evening with [oil-free cleanser](http://www.dm.de/cms/servlet/segment/de_homepage/presse/pressemitteilungen/187524/rb-balea-soft-clear.html)
* use a [facial tonic](http://www.benevi.com/de/produkte/benevi-hydroderm/obj-32-125.html) after shaving
* change my pillowcase twice a week
* don't eat much sweets
* eat a lot of fruits (homemade smoothies are one my favourites: just take a banana, kiwi and sometimes (frozen) raspberries or strawberries, add some juice and puree it --&gt; tastes really nice!)
* try not to touch my face if it isn't necessary

I do all these things since five month now, and my acne almost completely disappeared and it is getting better and better... I'm really happy with this progress after all these years of suffering. I thought I share my experiences with you, maybe this is a way for some other people, too. This would make me even happier ;)

I've posted on here a couple of times, and I feel like I owe the community an update.  I've suffered from acne my entire life (24M) I was on Accutane twice, tried proactive, and literally every over-the-counter prescription you can think of.  I have always had pimples (white-heads and red ones) around my mouth and face, and cystic acne around my neck.  Nothing seemed to really work for me.  

About 3-4 months ago I started a new routine.  I didn't want to post earlier because I was wondering if it was the typical 2-3 week success story that always happens right after starting a new routine, but this seems to be working better every day.  

In the morning I use an Apricot Scrub followed by Neutrogena's oil-free acne wash.  Then, I use quite a bit of moisturizer with Salicylic Acid.  (I've tried 2 brands of the Salicylic Acid Moisturizer and both work equally well).   At night, I do the same thing right before bed, only 4-5 days a week (I would do it every day if I had time!), I use a facial mask for about 20 minutes.  I've tried two of them... a $6-7 Sulfur-based mask (works the best, this price lasts me about a month+), and a clay-mask this lady at Target talked me into buying for around $9.  Both seem to work well - my face feels a little uncomfortably dry afterwards, but I put on more of the Salicylic Acid moisturizer immediately and it's fine.  

At first, I was using 10% Benzoyl Peroxide on my neck where the cystic acne was, but the mask seems to have taken care of that as well, and now I no longer use the BP (I haven't had anything on my  neck in 2 months, probably).  Now, on the off-chance I do get a pimple, it's usually around my mouth and I'm certain it's caused by me touching my face too much.  The pimples only last like a day and they never get big and inflamed.  

Anyway, I think the biggest thing is to not touch your face, using a mask nearly every day, and following it up with a moisturizer that contains salicylic acid.  I started seeing positive results from the sulfur mask almost immediately.  It's probably the best $6-7 dollars I've ever spent.  You can get it at WalGreens.

Acne for almost 5 years
BP and a ton of different cleansers and moisturizers the first Three
Tetralysal for 7 months with an Azaleic Acid cream the fourth
No improvement, it just kept on in a steady pace, and I was feeling like shit.
Stopped washing my face after this summer, I didn't quit cold turkey and started wahing my face once a day instead of two for a couple of weeks. And then I stopped completely. It worked! I never have breakouts, just a whitehead here and there, and they are usually really small and dissapear really quickly. My skintone is more even as well, and the HP dissapears faster. 

If you are finding that no cure works, and you have a summer break or a break from work for a few months. Then I recommend this. You think less of your acne since you are not scared of not washing your face often enough and that takes down the stress levels tremendously!

This is probably badly written but I just wanted to share.

I understand everyones pain, I've been there and still am in a way. Still struggling with some HP. But it will get better :)

I am almost 21, female. I have almost used salycilic acid products, as I got burned kind of badly by a product containing BP once. I attributed it to the fact that I was taking doxycycline (which only mildly helped) and this caused me to get burns from things that normally would not burn me (sunburned extremely fast and easily even with tonnes of SPF, I remember one time waxing my eyebrows my skin burned and came off--and I am quite positive the sugar-wax was not too hot or anything, etc) . So I figured it was probably just because of the Doxy, but I avoided it anyway (even though I havent taken doxy for years). Well, I bought some Clearasil ""Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream"" hwich is 10% BP. I stupidly threw away the box and receipt!

**Here's what happened.** Sunday: Washed my face before I went to sleep, used a qtip to apply a thin coat to the spotty areas, went to bed. Wake up on Monday, the area around my mouth (so upper lip, sides of mouth, and chin) is SUPER puffy, an unusual shade of red (not your typical pinky red, almost an orangey red--not normal for me), SCALE-Y/crusty, extremely itchy, somehow oily and dry at the same time, and just flat out terrible looking. I've never ever had a reaction like this to anything!

So first, I washed my face and put on some moisturizer. After a few hours, I noticed no difference at all. I tried icing it for a while--no help. I tried using my Clarisonic to buff out the scaley-ness ---did not help, probably even made it worse. It's weird, because it pretty much got rid of the few spots that were there overnight, but now my face looks awful. It's super embarrassing, and I know covering it with makeup will only make it worse so I haven't. I've taken benedryl for a few nights in a row hoping that I will wake up and my face won't be swollen and discolored---NO CHANGE. I dont even know what I can do anymore. I've googled, but all I see is ""take an antihistamine and ice it"" generally--well I've been doing that for DAYS (I mean, this started sunday night/monday morning and it's almost friday!!! What gives?) and nothing helps even the slightest.

I'm completely at a loss for what to do, and as much as I'd like to, I can't get to the doctor--I'm at college, my uni health center doesnt take walk ins, and I have exams and am too busy studying to take a few hours out of my day and do that.

-Omega 3: anti-inflammatory, and I never eat fish and nuts so my omega 3:6 ratio is skewed. I probably don't get any omega 3 at all..

-Zinc: already tried zinc oxide supplements, it seems I need to try a diffrent form as it isn't helping. Helps by regulating hormones which can be useful as i'm a teen.

-Chromium: Helps by regulating insulin levels, though I have a low sugar diet.
Not sure about vitamin A, and E though. A might function like tretinoin but that made me much worse. 




Another thing i'm trying out is changing my sleep cycle. I thouroughly fucked my sleep cycle up during the vacation, by going to bed at times randomly alternating between 11 PM, and 3AM, and then waking up whenever I wanted, usually arround 1PM.
From now on i'm going to bed at 9PM and waking up at 5AM (due to my job). Every day, and i'm making my room completely dark in the nights.

When I was 13-15 I had really bad acne all over my face (only face). I went to the dermatologist and surprise surprise, he prescribed Isotretinoin (Roacc). I started off taking 40mg a day, from September until June. By then, my face was completely clear, and soft. It looked wonderful and I couldn't be happier. As I was told, I continued cleaning my face with a special product used for post acne treatment. Fast forward two months and it's the end of August and pimples and blemishes start to appear on my face. I think nothing of it, but a bit pissed off because I thought I was acne free. It starts getting worse and I start getting huge, painful zits everywhere on my face. Acne is back, we head to the dermatologist and I start the treatment again. This time, 20mg a day. So the second round lasted from October-November until June. Same thing happens again. My face is clear, I keep washing it, couple of months later acne is back AGAIN and I rage and tell myself to wait, maybe it's normal. I go back in January 2012 and dermatologist says it's rare, but it happens. Treatment starts again, this time 10mg per day. Face clears up. Finish treatment in June because I'm going to the beach. It's August, little pimples are appearing and more than a few large zits. I still clean my face every day, and I hear that people don't get acne again after taking Roaccutane, why am I different?

Basically for the past 2 years, I've had pimples popping up all over my face, different spots, many at once, and I've just never been able to completely clear it.

First clue that I think it's hormonal acne is that it goes by cycles. Usually I have a few very good weeks where I'm pretty clear (again never completely) and then a few awful weeks with tons of pimples and red spots and stuff.

Recently (past 6 months or so) I've had mild acne on my upper back, chest, and shoulders. It's not as bad as my face but it's definitely visible.

My lifestyle in regards to acne:

-I shower once a day at least, always scrubbing nicely everywhere

-I switch my pillow covers often. Also I was just on vacation for two weeks (so you know the pillows in the hotel are clean everyday) and my acne still didn't clear up.

-I use a face-soap from Clean &amp; Clear every night

-I read somewhere that Vitamin D helps clear up acne. I'm a lifeguard since mid-June and have been getting plenty of sun, plus I take two pills so I'm getting 500% daily value for Vitamin D

-I exercise four-five times a week so my body is healthy, and I am de-stressed

-**Big one** Ever since June 17 (day I started my job and started a workout routine), I've been drinking ONLY water. Literally. Went from being a soda and sugary liquids addict to drinking only water, cold turkey. I've lost weight and feel better, but my acne hasn't cleared up.

So I've heard of laser treatment for acne scarring and it looks great - quick and easy.. expensive - probably, but worth it - most definitely. So for those who have done the treatment: 

* How quick is a session?
* What were the results like after 1 session?
* Following from previous question - Did you have follow up treatments? Results thereafter?
* Were there any side effects/What are most common side effects?
* How painful is it?

And of course..

At this point, I'm thinking of just going to a dermatologist, but I figured I'd ask about my problem here first.

Around my nose, I have what I think are a lot of small white heads, surrounded by redness. They regularly dry up and flake off, but then more come back. They're occasionally itchy. They've been here for 2 months.

I also have two red lumps that look like blisters. They don't have any pus, they're always completely dry. They shrink and grow randomly, but one has been there for three months, and the other is a recent development.

On top of this, I'm finding my face is very oily. About five hours after I've washed my face, it feels like I rubbed oil over it.

I wash my face three times daily, because it's so oily; when I wake up, after work, and before bed. I've tried using Cetaphil for oily skin, lemon juice, and a 10% benzoyle peroxide wash for cleansing. I exfoliate every two days, because of the heat. The only other thing I put on my skin is a sunscreen from Shiseido. I've been changing my pillow cases every day for the past two months. I recently bought some pads with tea tree oil to remove the oil from my face during the day, between washes, but I haven't tried them yet.

I'm not so worried about the red lumps, but the little white heads around my nose are an issue; if I have something important happening, I can't use makeup to conceal the redness, because it will just cake around the white heads.

There are different types of acne and they react to different things.  Secondly, this  has helped clear up about 90%+ of what I had (Chest/Face/Back).  Still have some but it is MUCH better and less noticeable.  I just had to share this info with other people that suffer from acne.  

I am a 24 year old male and I had moderate acne on body and face.  Nothing worked for me until I bought this product on a whim.  I use it daily even though it has the exfoliating beads in it.  I have used it twice a day on some days and my skin has not dried out or became itchy and irritated.  The product that has helped me is...

Biore: Acne Clearing Scrub
http://thisthatbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Biore-Acne-Clearing-Scrub-.jpg

I use this in the shower and let it stay on for about 5-7 minutes before washing it off.  I use this on body as well as my face.  Best results are on chest/face.  Back has improved but not as much as other areas.  

Another thing I noticed that helped my face out was using an electric shaver.  This is less offensive on the skin which does make a difference.  Both of these combined have improved me vastly.  I rather not post pics and stay anonymous, hence the throwaway.  I'd also be happy to answer any other questions.

Some other tips that have been said before but also seem to help are:

1.  Stop touching your face with your hands
2.  For body, put on a new clean shirt before you go to bed.  Also change pillow cases every few days to a week.
3.  Drink lots of water.
4.  Do not shower with super hot water.  Warm to cool helps close pores. 
5.  Stay away from sugary snacks and food.

I figured it's from junk food, soda, sugars..etc, but nope, I cut junk food for a while, yet I still suffered from it. I tried eating healthy, ate foods with proteins, vitamins, still have acne. I'm approaching college very soon and I'm really self conscious about it. My self esteem is dying because of this issue, and I'm really starting to get angry. :\

I've had stress since I was 11-12, anxiety problems..etc. It's all gone now, the only 'stress' I have is fear of failure in school, but it's not as severe as it was when I was a kid.

I've tried eggs in the morning, I left the yolk, didn't eat it. Rice with beans at lunch, rice with chicken, rice with tomatoes and meat, fish, fried chicken, salad, yet I still can't see any progress.

Could it be a problem with my testosterone levels? I'm 17 and I can't manage to grow facial hair yet, while friends in my age are fully grown up, and none of them suffers from acne.


I was okay with it as it wasn't very severe, but now it's just..out breaking? It's making my skin look...dead? It's not appealing, and it's starting to hurt, A LOT. It's under my skin and even chewing/opening my mouth makes it hurt.

I had acne on my chest, back, shoulders, but it all went away, there's a little left on the chest here and there, markings of past pimples, but it's almost gone, but my face, oh god it just won't go away.

I've already tried: benzoyl peroxide soap 5% and 10%, clean and clear 3 step, every other acne soap sold at the supermarket including salicylic acid soap, every topical pharmaceutical, dioxycycline (antibiotic), and isolaz ""suction and laser"" treatments, cutting dairy, washing my face 0, 1, 2, or 3 times a day, and not shaving, but nothing helped in any significant way.

What did help, was 2.5% benzoyl peroxide neutrogena on-the-spot cream, and a Vanicream soap bar and lotion, used at night. In the morning I just hop in the shower for a second and rinse with water. Eucerin soap and SMOOTHING REPAIR lotion did fine, but Vanicream just feels better. As well as CeraVE salicylic lotion. I wash my hair every other day and condition every third day. I shave with Aveeno shaving cream and a double edged safety razor every third day, or otherwise just use an electric shaver.

The only tough part is slathering my skin with lotion from chest to shoulders to face every, single, night. Using soap alone or on-the-spot alone was asking for trouble. Using lotion in the morning wasn't really an option, as my skin just looked and felt oily for the rest of the day.

I also had a face peel, a ""Jessner"" stength peel for about $110. It hurt like hell, but the results were amazing. Nothing beats the feeling of having your own skin flake off and pop its own pimples. It was also immensely satisfying frying your skin for all the trouble it put you through. My scarring has been drastically reduced, but I was ultra sun sensative for a week and my entire face was flaking off at work. The first day I could pass it off as bad sunburn, but the skin wasn't really red or irritated-looking at all after the second day.

I am now down to 0-2 small pimples a day, which, not having a pimple an entire day is an amazing feeling, nevermind if it's several times a week! If I do get any pimples, going to the tanning bed or getting a spray tan for the week makes it hardly noticeable.

Of course, this is just for me and I can't say whether this will work for you. I wish I had discovered this earlier, but the key is TO POOP.

The moment I start getting constipated and don't stay regular, my acne begins to flare up. Black and white, like a light switch. Seriously. That's all there is to it, for me at least. As long as I stay regular, my acne is completely manageable - either nothing or (when I sleep late) only small acne that isn't very prominent and goes away peacefully.

Just wanted to share this with you all. Try it! Tell me if it works for you too!

Side note: When I'm backed up, I end up going number 2 A LOT to compensate and get back to a state where my acne and general well being is in check. I'd go to the bathroom, and a while later feel like I should go again, and again. Also, I don't need to use cleanser and I seem to be doing fine.

Update (5th August, 2013): I do notice that even though I eat well, I have to make a conscious effort to sit down at the toilet a lot of the times to make sure that I do actually defecate!

Currently writing this as someone who, on a day when he breaks out, doesn't want to face anyone. Life has turned into a period of waiting for days of clear skin before enjoying life. 

Currently using Clinique's 3 step program (Salyclic Acid Cleanser + Astringent / Benzoyl Peroxide Moisturizer) and this is the best treatment that I've used, but still nowhere near clear skin. 

Been off and on with many different medications since I was younger, including cephalexin and doxycyclin. Tried various topical creams as recommended by a dermatologist, as well as over-the-counter remedies. Nothing seems to work. 

Overall, I am a very active person. Generally lift weights 3-4 days a week and do yoga/tennis the remaining days. I barely ever drink (a glass of wine once every two months) and eat fresh fruit and vegetables on the regular. I eat very little dairy , staying away from cheeses entirely. However, I do drink protein shakes regularly to get the adequate amount of protein necessary to build muscle. I take Biotin/Fish oil/Zinc every day, as I've read they help promote healthy skin.

So, I had my first dermatologist appointment yesterday, and after about 20 minutes of discussing my history with acne and other attempted treatments (I have tried since 8th grade, with no consistent or significant results whatsoever, to control and clear up my acne), the doctor asked me if I had heard of accutane. I told him I had, but had some serious concerns and reservations about it. He spent close to 30 minutes with me going over what the drug is, what it does, the concerns and side effects (for me mental health is the biggest one). He said that as long as I'm able to keep a close eye on the side effects and my general health, I should be alright. As far as mental health goes, I will likely be seeing a therapist/counselor regularly once I am back at school in August as well. Although I was hesitant at first, a better understanding of things made me feel more comfortable, and I agreed to the treatment, as after nearly 7 years of awful skin, I have absolutely had it, and am sick of never knowing what will help and what won't.

The questions I have are for people who have had an accutane treatment or are on it now. Particularly dryness of the skin and lips has come up as one of the biggest side effects- how easy is it to counteract this, with chapstick/moisturizers, etc? Is the same true for irritated skin and the like? I also understand that there is a risk of liver damage with alcohol consumption while on accutane. 

Honestly, any advice whatsoever is appreciated, and any tips to help counteract or reduce the severity of the side effects would put me much more at ease.

Went to a dermatologist, tried many different face washes, etc, to no avail. So a couple of months ago I noticed all my friends who have great skin do nothing and thought I may as well give it a try. It worked! (sort of). My forehead which normally would get big whiteheads stopped and cleared out pretty nicely. If I do get something it's a little bump that will be gone by the next day. 

However, my cheeks are a different story. It's really weird but one cheek only has continually been an issue since then (and it's NOT the side I sleep on nor the side I use my phone on). So the side I do everything on gets clogged pores along the jawline and most prominently next to my chin but nothing really gets irritated or breaks out. My other side though gets a lot more clogged pores in the same areas and unfortunately a good amount of them turn into just really irritated clogged pores/pimples/spots. 

My forehead and chin are the oily ones but not washing them seems to work fine. But it seems as if my cheeks which are drier reacted better to being washed everyday, which doesn't make sense to me. Of course I tried going back to washing just my cheeks with the products I used to use but that makes them dry too, which gives me more clogged pores. 

So yeah since stopping washing my face with soap I've gotten maybe a couple whitehead zits but mainly just irritated big red spots on one side of my cheek. My cheeks feel soft but along the mid to bottom jawline and a little in the center there are so so many clogged pores. The cheek that breaks out also feels more oily than the other side. If they are big I can squeeze the stuff out of them and it's fine but some go from being too small to squeeze to really inflamed.

I bought some jojoba oil but I'm afraid that might make the clogged pores irritated and make me break out.

My diet has nothing to do with it. (It's been consistent before and after this problem with no different meal changes and I don't eat dairy or meat and hardly ever eat sugar from non-fruit)

Has anyone ever had any of these problems? Found any solutions? Any advice? 

(Also don't know if dryness would contribute to this but the spots on my forehead fade in like 2-3 days whereas spots on my cheeks will remain for months. I'm guessing oil may have something to do with this too?)


Edit: I use this glycolic exfoliator aha product and it lightens past spots but doesn't really reduce my clogged pores

I decided to order a large quantity of tubes off of Ebay with 10% concentration and stick with the treatment. I started off with a single application per day and didn't notice any skin irritation, so I increased it to twice a day. Within 4-6 weeks, my back was almost completely clear aside from some scarring as seen in the pictures.

It's been 6-8 months since I began treatment and my back has remained clear. I've reduced the applications to once every 2 days or so. The 10% concentration does bleach clothing and I have plenty of ruined shirts to prove it. I usually apply it at night and wear an old shirt until I shower in the morning.

- 25 yr. old male

- Black 

- Had acne for as long as I can remember (probably started around 12-14 yrs. old.)

- Had dermatologists throughout my battle with acne.

- Used all the antibiotics in my preteen years, changed dermatologists in my late teen years and began using prescription strength facial washes with varying success.

- There was a brief period where I looked to Neutragena products, but knowing what I know now, I've realized I wasn't using the products in a way that would make them most effective/just using them wrong.

- I already have a baseline of depression and certain tendencies that make mood altering products like accutane a no go for me.
- Been using Prascion FC cloths for the past 2 years since being prescribed by my dermatologist along with other products that I could not afford to get even with insurance, so I have had my physician refill my prescriptions on the Prasiocn to avoid the cost of having to see a ""specialist"" because the dermatologist would not refill my prescription without a visit and at each visit she'd prescribe the same products, knowing I could only afford the one, so I didn't see the point in wasting the money on the visit.

About 1 month ago I was informed that the acne medication that I ad been prescribed by my dermatologist, and the only product that I have ever known to limit my acne to a satisfactory level (Prascion 15% Sodium Sulfactimide, 10% Sulfur) had been discontinued because of that I resolved to finally find an over the counter treatment to my acne since I had recently gotten a job that would allow me to engage in trial and error.


The first Product I used was OXY maximum strength 10% BP face wash. I would apply it in the morning and at night and after using Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser. After about a week of pretty good results my skin got very dry, flakey and I had a ridiculous whitehead breakout on my forehead. I held on for a week or two, but after that I decided that, that was enough.

(BTW: I work in the film industry and had recently been hired to work a TV show for a major network show. So I'm working the biggest job of my life, surrounded by strangers and my self esteem lower than it's been since H.S.)

I go into a fury of research and find that 10% BP is not proven to be any more effective than 2.5% or 5% BP, but it is certainly more of a irritant. This leads me to learning that the whiteheads are being caused by overactive oil glands reacting to how dry my skin has  
become. This information leads me to Acne.org where I find a 2.5 BP treatment that has good reviews and a community that seems very supportive.


So I moved to a 5% BP med: Clean and clear 3 in 1. The white heads subsided A BIT, but my skin was still very dry and flakey and I wasn't satisfied at all. After 2 weeks of clean and clear I couldn't just keep going. 

So now the plan is to let my skin recover from the dryness and then try the BP treatment from Acne.org.

So, I go old school with it and buy neurtagena oil-free acne wash. This is a 2% Salicylic acid treatment. I've never had trouble with this product in the past, but now when I use it my skin becomes dry, not as dry as the 10 and 5 BP treatments, but dry enough to allow the whiteheads to keep coming.

So I quite the neutragena after a week and decide to just go the Cetaphil clenser, and even that leaves my skin dry now.


So I started only washingh my face with water, then patting it dry, and then moisturising. been doing this for about 2 weeks, still dry.

Now I'm only wash my face with water and go right to the lotions because I've heard that is a good way to trap the water on your skin.

Any advice to give would be appreciated, because the funny thing is, through all of this I have not had any of the deep-seated pimples that linger for weeks and then leave a massive scar, so a part of me is hopeful (and hope is a rarity for me when it comes to my skin) that if I'm just able to get my skin back to a healthy state that I'd find that my acne has subsided (naive, maybe, but I've been medicating for the last decade and a half, so how would I know :)). 

Also, I have a suspicion that this excessive and persistent dryness could be a rash or infection of some kind. If anyone knows of such a condition please feel free to share.

-  big point, but I wasn't sure where to put this inside the body: since finding out about the drying effects of OXY and other 10% BP products I have used/combined a Vasaline, Palmers, Cetaphil, Jojoba oil and/or A&amp;D oiontment all to minimal/incrimental success.

I'm an American living in China (I've been here for 8 months now) and about 2 months ago I had a sudden acne outbreak on my face. Never had this problem before and it has taken a big toll on my self-esteem. I've been fighting with it since then. Lots of factors could be at work here... stress, change in diet, water quality, terrible pollution levels, etc.... I finally realized that the bad water quality of the water in my shower might be a factor I can actually change (I have to boil water to drink it, and the water has metals and chlorine in it, so why wouldn't it be bad for my skin? I can't believe I didn't figure that out sooner...) so I started washing my face with bottled water instead of washing in the shower, and I've seen some improvement since then, along with not eating dairy. 
I broke down and had my parents spend a large sum of money to send me a package of American products because the Chinese brands seem to irritate my skin more. Now I have some BP cleanser and some Clean &amp; Clear cleanser, some Arbonne exfoliant, toner, Proactic moisturizer, and some salicylic acid cream. I also have a couple of different facial masks. My acne is starting to clear up but now my face, especially around my lips, is very dry and flaky. I cleanse twice a day and moisturize a lot. 

Two questions: 

I've read that using physical exfoliating products isn't that great because it could be more irritating. Should I try it? How often should I be doing it? Would it make my skin more dry, or help it? 

Should I be alternating the cleansers (like BP at night, and Clean and Clear in the morning) to cut down on dryness and redness, or should I stick with one kind? When I wake up my skin looks pretty good and more evenly toned, but then I wash it and it's all red again. :/ 

Thanks in advance. I have been having a difficult time dealing with this.

1365279423.0,5,self.acne,1btadk,Pantothenic Acid-The over-the-counter miracle drug,suhongy,6,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1btadk/pantothenic_acidthe_overthecounter_miracle_drug/,"I'd like to bring attention to Pantothenic Acid, probably the best over-the-counter drug I've ever used. I've seen more direct results from using this product in terms of acne reduction AND reduction in oil production than any other over-the-counter product out there. Other drugs attack the acne after it has already occurred, but Pantothenic Acid reduces oil production and PREVENTS acne from occurring in the first place. This stuff really works and is not a joke or a lie-I'm just trying to help others out there. This is the go-to-drug if you're unlucky enough to be without health insurance. Any questions, just ask!

Here's a little Information on it:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantothenic_acid

**Edit: Routine, effects and brands**

I started November 2012.

**Routine**

At the start I took 10 grams, or 10000 mg, a day every day, no skipping, which depending on the brand equates to 10-20 pills. I spread the doses out out to 5 in the morning and 5 mid day/noon. It sounds like a lot, but it's not and worth it.

Now that I'm acne free I still take the pills to keep oil reduction  and maintenance down. I've switch brands but now consume between 0-5g per day depending on the stress level and how long I'm out for. If Stress = high I take more. During finals and such I would take 500-1000 mg per hour I was up past mid night.

I've tried spreading out the doses of 2000 mg per hour til I've reached 10000 mg, but found this not as effective on high stress days. Oil production seems to ramp up during the ""productive"" hours so that's the time frame you should focus on most. I've heard taking a gram or two before sleeping also helps.

**Effects**

I saw significant oil reduction about 1 month in and STAGGERING oil reduction about 3 months in. Combine with a good salicylic acid based exfoliate wash and have been acne free since Jan. So huge results after 3-4 months. I've use the same wash without the pantothenic acid and still struggled with oil production and acne.

I've always struggled with oil production so I don't plan on ever getting off the Pantothenic Acid as a control for oil production as it's safe and effective. I know you can take accutane to permanently control oil production but that isn't an option now and maybe ever. 

**Brands**

[Pan Acid](http://www.amazon.com/Acid-Pantothenic-1000mg-Timed-Release/dp/B000NZDN2Y/ref=pd_bxgy_hpc_img_z/181-5974515-6532347)

The first brand I used was Pan acid 1000 mg timed release. These are great as they are timed released, a completely solid pill, which help regulate oil production better  throughout the day. They’re also the highest doseage on the market which means less pills. I took 10 a day which means a bottle lasts 10 days.

However the price fluctuates too much, being anywhere from 15$ a the current price of 23$ a bottle. If they were still 15$, these are the pills to get.

[Now Foods](http://www.amazon.com/Foods-Pantothenic-Acid-500mg-Capsules/dp/B0013OUQEM/ref=pd_sim_hpc_3/181-5974515-6532347)

My current brand is Now foods 500mg. You get 250 pills per bottle which gives you more for your $. The price is low and stays pretty constant at between 11-15$. These are encapsulated so they dissolve faster. They take a little more managing than Pan acid to get the dosage correctly spread throughout the day. The dosage is also less per pill so you’ll be taking in twice the pills as you would be with Pan acid. They do the job however but not as care free as Pan acid.

Finally found a regimen through trial and error and am now acne free!,secret_anus_man2,8,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1bhwig/moderate_and_cystic_acne_for_10_years_finally/,"I've pretty much tried everything short of Accutane over the years (Proactive, Benzyl Peroxide, Retinoid A, Clindamycin, Tea Oil, Clarifoam facial peels, saltwater/egg whites, you name it). These products work for a month or so, then the oiliness/cystic acne comes back and I'm off to find another solution. This has been a cycle for 10 or so years for me but I've finally found a regimen/lifestyle that works for me. Decided I should share in case you guys can benefit from it too.

Morning:

Take a shower as soon as you wake up. No matter what, don't leave without taking a shower, especially if its cold or humid outside.

Once in the shower, wash your hair first then move onto your face. Use a watery salicylic acid facial cleanser (like Biore Ice Cleanser) as a first wash, rinse and then apply another thin layer. Use an electric rotating brush (Olay Pro-X, make sure to clean with isopropyl alcohol) and brush until foam appears. Rinse off and once you're done showering your other parts, get out and immediately apply cold water (10-20 sec) to your face to close the pores.

Dry your face (pat) with a clean towel and apply a sulfur based product (Acnomel) mixed in a non-oily moisturizer ASAP. Warning, this stuff dries you up so make sure to moisturize/check your face for any dried skin.

I know this is controversial, but take TWO Apple Cider Vinegar pills/~4 tsps. (work your way up from 1/day) with TWO Vegetarian Probiotic pills/~14 bil. CFU (Nutrition Now PB 8) with breakfast. I think this is the most important step of all as now I truly believe what's inside of your digestive system WILL show up on your face. Not only has my digestion regularity improved but I've also noticed that my... excrement has been less noxious. Warning, for the first two weeks you will notice bloating/mild stomach aches but stick through it!

During the day:

AVOID touching your face. On the same note, make sure to wash your hands regularly just in case you do. Watch what you eat, but don't avoid all of your favorite foods. Generally follow a low GI (Glycemic Index) diet as much as you can, so avoid processed starches and candy. I have noticed that after consuming large amounts of high GI foods, my face tends to 'sweat' and I feel that may contribute to acne. However, if you do have cravings like I do, just remember that moderation is key. Most important of all, remember to drink lots of water throughout the day! 1-3 water bottles should be enough. If you can, apply some sunscreen and get a little sunshine outside! It helps even out your complexion if you tan and hides some darker acne as well.

Night:

Shower before you sleep using the same regimen as the morning. If you have the time, replace the pillowcase or towel you sleep on. Try not to sleep on your side or put a blanket over your face as that'll cause excess sweating/blocking of pores. Also, make sure to have a cool breeze on your face as you sleep if you notice that you tend to sweat/get oily during the night. If you can, try to maintain a constant sleeping schedule. If you do have to stay up all night, make sure to shower before and after since the stress will make your skin oil up.

Breakout Time (ughh):

Sadly, this regimen won't work right away. Give at least 1-2 weeks for any previous buildups to come out. For cystic acne: if you touch it and it hurts, DO NOT try to pop it. Instead, apply a thin layer of salicylic acid cleanser ONLY on the center of the bump and let it dry out overnight. After a night or two, the skin around it will peel away and a white center should appear. Use a needle to poke it (it should give way very easily, if you're poking with force then that's the wrong place) and with one motion swiftly pop it with a blackhead remover or disinfected hands. It should have that characteristic popping feeling/sound and some bleeding (gross.. right?).
 
Apply hydrocortisone for the redness and some sulfur product. Make sure to thoroughly clean the area around it since it will spread without proper care. If there is no popping, you picked at it too early and it WILL get red, so make sure to judge the time right. This may sound hokey, but I have used liquid whey from yogurt/crushed up aspirin to reduce this redness and bring out the whitehead also. Blackheads: if you have the urge, make sure to use a proper blackhead remover and get ALL of it out or else you risk infection/cystic acne. That generally means you'll have a gaping hole where the blackhead used to be. 

Cleanup:
If you're acne free, you may have some scars on your face. Use Bio-Oil with your morning face regimen and it should go away in a couple of months.

I've been using the aczone cream on my neck and after 2.5 weeks I really noticed the cysts (which were mainly unbroken/unpopped and below the surface) have really really shrunk (like I cant feel them anymore but I can still see a tiny red spot where they were in the mirror) and that I have no new ones. 

The one downside I have found with aczone is that it is not exactly clear. Its a white non-oily cream, similar to any basic moisturizer, when it is first applied it is clear, however after about 15 minutes when it has dried it appears as visible white.  Due to this I haven't been using it twice a day like it says to, but only once at night and it's still working. (And I even missed a few nights). One major plus is that it will NOT bleach your clothes or pillows so it is totally safe to use and I love it way better than benzoyl peroxide. 

I definitely recommend you look into getting it if you have cystic acne (especially jawline subsurface bumps), as this is what aczone is said to target, however even on my prescription box, like many other acne medications, it says ""the mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to be safe and effective"" except oral dapasone is commonly used as an antibiotic so it probably is an antibiotic too. 

I haven't noticed any side effects from it, it isn't drying or irritating to me, just effective!!

Any tips on improving/changing my facial cleansing habits?,ESPSloth,5,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/18mgl6/i_have_blackheads_on_my_forehead_and_nose_that/,"I'm an 18 year old male and my acne isn't bad, per se, but it's worse than it's more or less been in any of my earlier teenage years. 

I have problems with constant blackheads on my forehead and all along my nose. I have a rather greasy face, as I often use one of those 'oil absorbing sheets' [something like this](http://www.audreydao.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Clean-and-Clear-Oil-Absorbing-Sheets-Packaging.jpg) in the middle of the day to absorb the grease, in which the grease leaves a notable shine on my face. Whenever I squeeze my nose (more often accidentally than not) the blackheads begin to seep out, but only a bit. As I said, they don't do away. I've had these blackheads on my face and forehead for years. If I try to get rid of a bad one, it scabs up and takes a while to heal which is annoying, but I'm always certain to wash my face afterwards. I don't get another blackhead in the same spot afterwards, for as long as I can remember I previously squeezed one in that location.

I have tried Pro-Activ and it did nothing good to my skin, actually made it worse and have my a couple blonde eyebrows, haha. (I had some acne behind my eyebrows at the time, not now though) 

I wash my face with Spectro-Jel in the morning (no face cloth, warm water) after I shower. I also wash my face with a face cloth in the evening and use the Spectro-Jel again on my face. I shave once every four or five days, and have in the last two months found a good technique to avoid getting ingrown hairs on my neck when shaving. (The bumps that they made over a month ago are still healing. I didn't pick them either. No clue why they are taking forever)
I use a Gilette Mach 3 razor to shave and typical Gilette shaving cream.
I have a prescribed acne cream but when I ran out of my prescription for the last month and a half, everything seemingly got better. Using it again, I get acne bumps between my eyes/eyebrows and hair.
As well, I change my pillowcases every few days to help in that regard.

I also get the typical facial acne, nothing severe, on my cheeks and chin and whatnot. It's not too concerning, but I should note part of the reason I don't shave frequently is to cover up the red splotches that do show up. And it is rather noticeable after I do shave.

I have short hair which does not cover my forehead. I drink just about only water, but juice with breakfast and dinner - water with lunch too. I don't eat junk food, maybe something small once a week. I don't eat a whole lot of meat. I've been called skinny but perhaps that's because I'm just tall - I am a healthy weight, not overweight. I walk a lot for my job and walking around school campus. That's my main exercise I get. Not sure what other dietary/bodily information could help with advice, but I'm more than open to give any information that could contribute to helping remove my blackheads/acne as a whole.

1360788454.0,5,self.acne,18gtfn,Antibiotics Progress and Questions (pic in description) ,datderethrowacc,5,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/18gtfn/antibiotics_progress_and_questions_pic_in/,"Hey /r/acne. I've lurked this sub for awhile now and I decided to post a progress of my antibiotics treatment and I also had a couple questions to ask. To start off, I am a 21 year old male with oily skin and I have had moderate outbreaks since I was 16. These would be deep inflamed pimples (papules) but they would only come like 3 at a time and they were usually scattered but localized to my temples, high cheek, and occasionally my forehead. While the outbreaks started when I was 16, and have continued till now, these past 3 months have been pretty unsettling. I broke out really bad on my right cheek where I got a few inflamed nodules and a conglomerate of pimples that surrounded them. The cysts were quite painful and I attribute the breakout to the Cetaphil moisturizer I was using when trying out a version of Dan's Regimen on the acne.org's website. 

What I have used in the past:

* Neutrogena's Clean and Clear Cleanser

* Obagi Cleansiderm System

* ACV

* Lemon Juice

* Baking Soda Masks

* Dan's Regimen using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, 2.5% BP, Cetaphil Moisturizer

My Current Regimen:

* Wash my face 2 times a day, morning shower and facewash at night with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser 

* Apply Clindamycin at night post-cleanser

* Take 100mg of Minocycline with breakfast everyday
(side effects in the beginning were dizziness, diarrhea, a bit of nausea, and minor headaches) 

* Take an assortment of vitamins before sleep: (Multivitamin, 2 Fish Oils, 5000 IU Vit D, 50mg Chelated Zinc, and Probiotics)

* I consumer over a gallon of water daily

* Wash with a new face cloth everyday, new pillowcase every night, and have tried to sleep on my back as much as I can

I am an active guy and I eat extremely clean, no dairy (lactose intolerant), minimal gluten intake, a lot of vegetables and my diet has not changed in the past year. I eat the same thing every day so diet could not be a contributing factor to my recent extreme breakout.

Anyways, as promised, here's a picture that shows my progress in the past 2 months: http://i.imgur.com/21pxyJZ.jpg. As you can see, the antibiotics have helped quite a bit in the short term, but I still have significant post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation and I understand that it will take quite a bit of time to fade. Not shown in the picture are macules left by other pimples located on my left cheek and on my temples. I am still trying to determine the cause of my localized pimples and I think it had to do with the way I would sleep at night, perhaps sleeping resting my head on my dirty hands as my blemishes form in a pattern that look like resting places for my hand. As well, the breakouts occur in a ski goggle formation so I assume that my prior poor hygiene when I used to ski may have caused certain areas of my skin to become more acne prone in my late teens. (Excuse long back story, but I felt that I should have explained the process till now to hopefully answer any prior questions that are commonly asked by community members when someone comes on looking for help.)

So, as you can see the antibiotics are working but my biggest question is what do I do after the antibiotics? I have toyed with the idea of accutane to quell the acne before it could leave any significant scarring but I want to make sure I use this as a last resort. Also, I don't plan on cutting my antibiotics treatment short as I understand the risks of antibiotic resistant bacteria, but I don't want to stay on antibiotics in the long term either due to health reasons. To those that went through an antibiotic treatment, what did you end up doing and did you see any success in keeping the acne in remission?

As well, I wanted to ask if any other males on /r/acne have tried concealer on their PIH? I am now approaching my college graduation as well as looking to go into interviews for several jobs so I wanted to find something to cover up my blemish in the short term. I am looking for something that is non-comedogenic and oil free so females are welcome to answer this as well :).

I wanted to share my experience with acne so it may help some people out (even if it helps one person its worth it) ... I use to have bad acne so bad it affected my entire life. Some days I wanted to die but I didnt want people to see my face full of acne at my funeral either. It just wasnt me it wasnt what I was meant to look like.  Everyone on here has or is going through the same thing I went through.... I tried it all but nothin worked. I even gave up at times and said there is no cure... the cream I use is called oxy 10% maximum strength benzoyl peroxide. I used it 4 years ago but saw my acne get worse so i stopped using it. 4 years later I read an article saying acne simply cannot survive in an oxygenated environment. For some reason I trusted this article. I went out and bought oxy cream again and said im gona put this on everyday I don't care if it gets worse or not.  2 weeks later it did indeed get worse... I doubted myself but I didn't care.  I kept going.  My face was red as shit it felt like sunburn all the time.  4 weeks in. I noticed pimples were still coming in but took only 2 days to disappear completely including the red marks... my old acne was still there... 2 months in. My old acne is only red marks...no fresh pimples at all for about 3 weeks now and my skin is no longer red from the oxy... 3 4 5 6 months later... red marks gone ...acne completely clear my skin is 100 percent adjusted to oxy like its moisturizer. 1.5 years later...  My life has changed 100 percent. I only use a quarter of a dime sized amount and it blends into my pale skin within seconds and im done for the day. I even find myself slacking off not using oxy for 2 to 3 days .... then I notice a pimple and use it and it goes right away.... dont ever give up on your acne. If u have pretty tough skin try oxy 10% bp ... its cheap as hell for a 4 pack on amazon... one day when I stop working 55 plus hours a week and get out of college full time I want to start eating better and see if I can fix my acne naturally.

4 years ago I was on Roaccutane oversees and and it was working wonders, but I moved for college halfway through and my old doctors couldnt legally prescribe me enough pills to get me through the entire treatment. They said to get a Canadian doc to follow through for me. Little did I know that public healthcare meant super slow appointment bookings. So my treatment kinda just ran out. I had to wait about a year and a half to get an appointment. At that point I had already run out of pills twice (I optimistically restarted the treatment again back home with hopes that I would definately get a derm to follow through for me here in Canada).

Anyway, by the time I got an appointment I was off it, and the doc said she didnt really want to prescribe it for me since it she ""had seen much worse cases"". I'm not entirely sure how the healthcare system works here, even though ive been here for a long time now, but I really just wanted to start the treatment again. It was working wonders. I was just on the brink of a success story until I ran out. The years that have gone by have costs me lots of scars and low confidence. 

Do the Canadian doctors not want to prescribe it to non-extreme cases because of the financial load it would have on the health care system if they over prescribed it? Back home there I had private health care covered by my dad's work insurance. So pretty much I could book an appointment just days in advanced and everything would be covered.

I'm a 21 year old male who's had acne since middle school.  I've tried antibiotics, herbal remedies, acne.org's regimen, and 2 complete 6 month doses of accutane.  Unfortunately my acne has continued to return.

Earlier this year, due to a long streak of being busy, I broke my normal schedule of masturbating on a daily/every-other-day basis.  I immediately noticed my face looking better but didn't really think anything of it.  Now however, after several months of experimenting (stopping, letting face clear, then starting again) I'm CONVINCED that something involved with masturbation has been causing my acne for a while now.

Needless to say, I've stopped masturbating completely and my face hasn't been this clear since I got off accutane :)


Obviously, just like every other ""treatment"", this won't work for everyone.  But it's free, has other health benefits, and (after the first week) isn't particularly challenging to do.  

I just wanted to spread the word in case there are others out there who this might help.

It may sound silly, but it really is annoying when I do something like go camping and can't bring it, or I go on a plane and can't carry my current pack (usually i get 4oz + packs). I want to go off of it for good, but am afraid I will constantly pick at my new acne, and I know for a fact that it will come back for a couple of weeks minimum, not to mention the hard hit on my confidence.

All it did was keep the acne at bay.  It was still there and I would still break out every week but at the time I thought this was my best option.  However, it made my skin extremely dry and it was pain to put on every day twice a day.  I was using the acne.org regime kit by the way.  Then about three months ago, I came across this book called ""AcneNoMore"".  It's available online at about 40 bucks if anyone is interested.  I'll give the gist of it here though.

* Cut out sugar, fast food, white bread &amp; white rice, dairy.

* Eat only about two fruits a day since of the sugar content.

* Don't forget the veggies.

* Supplements which I'll cover in a little bit.

Okay, so this is what works for me.  I had extremely stubborn acne in my T zone.  In the morning, I start with a ""superfood"".  I use AmazingGrass.  It's loaded with all the good stuff - wheatgrass, fiber, probiotics.  Probiotics are very important if you have acne.  Buy a supplement if you don't have any.  Fiber is also very important.  Go for 25 to 40 grams a day.  Both from whole grains &amp; fruit.

Important Supplements to Take.

Multivitamin are good but they tend to have low levels of zinc, chromium, selenium, and vitamin D.  So you have to buy additional ones to add to your multivitamin.  The ones I listed are all very important in fighting acne. ZINC, CHROMIUM, SELENIUM, VITAMIN D (along with your multivitamin).  PS - over 50 mg of zinc can be toxic.  I use Source optizinc (30 mg).

This next supplement is the bees knees in fighting acne.  It is your ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS.  I have Total EFA - vegetarian - the liquid one.  I highly recommend this brand.  The ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 should be 2:1 so I also take fish oil for more omega 3 in my diet.  I have Carlsons Finest Cod Liver Oil lemon flavored (liquid).  I love it.

For my regime, I use Apple Cider Vinegar 1:1 in the morning.  I wash my face with this DesertEssence face wash.  At night, I use their tee tree oil cleansing pads.  And I moisturize with Aloe Vera gel at night. (use a small amount).

If you start doing everything I recommended, I really don't see how your acne should not go away or at least significantly decrease.

If this does not work, I really strongly recommend you conduct a three day detox (only fruits, veggies, &amp; detox tea) or (a water fast if you have the balls) to get rid of your toxins.  My face looks amazing after I detox or fast.",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_11s9jb,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/11s9jb/how_i_got_rid_of_my_acne_quick/,

Several times I noticed that as soon as I did anything more than cleanser in that area I would break out. I have gone short periods without doing anything to my face, but never longer than 3-4 days in which I'll typically get a pimple or two. I keep seeing more people popping up saying that they cleared up simply by just cleaning their face with water twice a day, so it makes me really tempted to try it but I'm not sure how that would help my under the skin acne (well that's what my dermatologist insists it is, I kind of think its just scaring).

For those who had success just using water and cutting out all the products, how long did it take to come to the conclusion it was working? Also, did you initially breakout a bit at first and then once that cleared up you were more or less clear?

I also welcome any input on my regimen:

Night:

-Clinique Acne Cleanser (Salicylic Acid) - Feels very gentle, like it a lot

-Aztec Secret Clay Mask - Mix this with Apple Cider Vinegar and a couple drops of Tea Tree Oil, leave on my face for about 15 minutes and then wash it off in the shower. Just started doing this after reading about success with similar/same products. I'd definitely say my skin looks nice after it's done being red. Doing every night for 2 weeks (near end of week 1), then will go down to 2-3 days a week depending. Days I don't do this I'll use the Clinique Acne Toner.

-Clinique Acne Moisturizer (2.5% BP)

-Couple drops of Jojoba Oil (Also recently added)

Morning:

-Clinique Acne Cleanser

-Clinique Acne Toner (Salicylic Acid) - Meh, considering changing this. Brand name also makes it a bit pricey.

-Clinique Combination Oily to Oily Moisturizer - Seems to absorb relatively quickly. Feels nice, doesn't make face shiny or anything. Have considered adding in a couple drops of Jojoba Oil.


The Jojoba Oil and Clay Mask were just started about half a week ago. I've also broken out a bit recently. I feel like this might be from the mask/oil bringing stuff that was in my skin to the surface and it's just a temporary thing, or that's what I'm hoping. I like how the mask makes my face feel, but the oily feeling of the Jojoba feels like the opposite of how my face should be.",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_10xdxi,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/10xdxi/questions_for_people_whove_had_success_just/,

Seems like when one spot goes, another one, some cases worse than the previous, just pops up closely next to it. Some never even go yellow/have a head on them, just feel deep and very painful to touch. You can see my skin condition on my forehead is terrible from my previous spots, I've really struggled for ages. 

The rest of my face is fine, I only get spots on my forehead, which seems so different to other acne sufferers.. My forehead does become very, VERY oily, but from my experience, removing this oil through washing/blotting sheets just makes me break out even more. The creases in my forehead are so, so deep for someone just 21 years old. 

I've been on minocycline for almost 1 year and a half, I take a OMEGA-3 daily supplement, along with a Vitamin C 60mg supplement, do regular exercise, and eat vegetables, fruit every single day. I also drink about 4/5 mugs of green tea, using green tea leaves from China every single day, without fail. I should add almost every dinner (evening meal) is cooked with fresh vegetables by stir frying. 

I'm using a Tea Tree Facial Foam during the morning, moisturising with Simples oil balancing moisturiser, then using UV30 facial sun lotion. At night I'm using Spot-Stress Control Exfoliator, and then a Vitamin A Night Cream. During both the morning and night, I am using an Anti-biotic gel called metronidazole (at 0.75%).

What am I doing wrong? Anything I should improve on? I feel so ugly, and feel like I'm just getting uglier as I'm ageing, even with the effort I'm putting in to combat this stupid skin of mine. 

By the way, Accutaine is out of the question because I'm from UK, and as far as I'm aware I cannot get it prescribed to me here.

My skin is clearing up, and I've not had any new spots ever since I've stopped drinking green tea and exfoliating on a night. It seems my forehead is clearing up, albeit still oily. I almost have 0 spots now! The ones left aren't even painful and the inflammation is going down.

Acne is severely impacting my confidence and social life. I don't leave the house, or seek out social activities unless I am going to school or going to work. When I look at myself in the mirror I want to cut my face off, not only because of what it looks like either.


I have **constant** facial pain, absolutely anywhere it is red or inflamed in the pictures. Honestly, I don't care what I look like, but my face absolutely constantly is in pain around a 4/10 scale. I can not shave without cutting my face up.


I'm willing to try remedies etc, but I can't do the severe diet things I see suggested around here. I have significant food allergies especially to fruits and also have blood sugar issues with are far more important to control than my facial issues.

I also read about it on the different acne forums. I put it on (mixed 4-5 drops with cetaphil acne moisturizer, as directed) and immediately felt like I had made a mistake. My skin was shiny (as expected) but just felt dirty and inviting to acne. It felt like while I had been doing so well drying up the excess oil and taking away the comfort that acne thrives in I had suddenly provided a safe oily haven for it. I have heard that even if you're oily you should add more moisture to your face. I don't know who came up with this claim. My affected areas were previously turning a light pink and fading away. Immediately after putting it on (and the following day) my skin got bright red and colorful again like it had been hydrated with whatever acne thrives on. 

My skin was doing fantastic and drying up daily. I was using ACV (2 tbs w/ water) and vitamin B5 along with minocycline, sulfate face wash (pracion), and clindamycin phosphate gel topical (all from my derm). Things were really improving and it seemed to be because everything was drying up. My skin wasn't peeling but it just felt less oily and the color was fading.

Well I took the advice of moisturizing with jojoba oil. What a fucking mistake. My face broke out almost immediately (put it on overnight to test it) and has gotten significantly redder. I tried it for one more day thinking maybe it needed to adjust. I feel like I lost at least 2 weeks of progress. Everything got redder, more inflamed, and new pustules emerged.

Though I personally have never experienced any negative effects from taking upwards of 20g of B5 a day even without a b-complex, it is still recommended.

**HERE'S THE TIP:** *If you take a b-complex, get one that has VERY LITTLE Biotin in it.*

**WHY:** Look up Biotin and acne and you'll find the reason why. Biotin increases oil production and can really exacerbate acne.

I'm willing to bet that for some people the B5/b-complex regimen didn't work for this reason.

**HOW I FOUND OUT:** I had done personal experiments with a product called MaxiHair, which is supposed to be good for skin, hair and nails, and it was a b-complex to boot, so I thought, why not use that as my b-complex. But, I noticed that when I took it I broke out more. I didn't think anything of it, I just stopped taking it. 

But a week ago, I stopped taking B5 to find out precisely how much benefit Octagon soap is having on my skin. Going from a boatload of B5 to none in a day resulting in some withdrawal, so I went back to MaxiHair, which did help with my mood. Big mistake, broke out like crazy. And now I realize it is because of the Biotin. Now that I'm off the Biotin, things are returning to normal.

I've been having trouble with moderate acne the last 3 years. My sophomore year of high school, I had almost no skin trouble. My junior year of high school, I saw some minor acne emerge. This prompted a visit to the dermatologist who prescribed me Epiduo and instructed me to use the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash before I apply it. This worked wonders. My skin looked great again. I was confident. 

But confidence soon turned to laziness and I abandoned my skin regimen the summer going into senior year. When August rolled around, my skin had some minor acne, nothing too severe. I had a couple of spots but it wasn't anything that caused me to change my confidence or my attitude. 

During the last two months of my senior year, my skin had never looked worse. While my forehead largely remained clear, I had acne plague both sides of my face. Eventually when I got another appointment with my derm, (I had run out of refills for my Epiduo) I asked for something a little stronger. He prescribed me Retin-A. 

So far, it has only made my skin look worse. After a month of use I've only seen my face acne ridden. Recognizing that my skin wasn't getting any better, I rang up my dermatologist and asked him for another prescription of Epiduo, he obliged. Now that I have both Epiduo and Retin-A, should I ditch the Retin-A and make the switch to Epiduo? Or tough it out and stick to the Retin-A?

At that time I was living in halls, so it's possible that diet played a part in this: I moved out of halls the next year and started cooking healthily for myself and my skin got much better (although by no means brilliant).
These past few months however, my skin has got catastrophically worse again with no change in diet. This coincides with the fact that I have been prescribed a new contraceptive pill (Cilest), so I'm wondering if it's been caused by that.
My additional problem is that I have very sensitive skin that dries out very easily and becomes incredibly flaky, tight and painful, which rules out the use of some skincare products.

I do moisturise, I use diluted tea tree oil to cleanse my skin, and I have a Body Shop seaweed facewash thing that I use instead of soap, but recently my skincare regime has stopped having any effect whatsoever. I did try a benzoyl cream for a while, but it just made my face red and raw. Same thing happens with most of the over-the-counter skincare products that I've tried.

I'm going a bit frantic now, because I thought this was a problem that I'd grow out of, I'm incredibly self-conscious of it, and frankly, because they're often deep and almost cyst-like spots, my face looks remarkably similar to a sock full of marbles. I want this to stop.

I was given some lotion and lip balm to reduce the irritation which I will be getting. Well, I've looked it up on the internet and the side effects sounds pretty depressing. I don't know if I want to start this.

I've already bought it. I don't know if I want to take it :(

Any advice?

Before that it was ""normal"" or even slightly dry, but after three to four hours, it turned as oily as it could get. It looked like I was sweating, really shiny.
My dermatologist told me to try the fruit acid based face care listed below, and so I did. The price was ok, I guess you have to look it up in your country to see what it costs there.

---

It consists of two different lotions:

**Noreva Zeniac Gel**, that stuff should last you some months

**Noreva Zeniac LP Fort** (they also have that without the ""Fort"", i.e. not so strong stuff if your skin gets irritated or you see that it gets better), it's less than the gel, but you don't have to use that much.

---

*How to use it*

(1) After showering but still on a slightly wet skin, apply the maximum of a hazelnut drop on your skin and let it soap in for two minutes. Spread between your fingers before doing so will alleviate the process. I simply massage it onto my forehead for the two minutes. You can also do it whilst being in the shower, but I suppose part of it gets washed off in the process. Afterwards, rinse with luke warm water and dry off with a clean towel (recommendation: separate small towel for face, change all few days)

(2) Onto the dried skin, apply the LP Fort cream. Use not more than a pea sized drop. Do not apply onto open wounds (from picking your face etc). You'll do it once but it burns like hell for a few minutes then. If the skin gets oily after half a day, apply the cream again. Don't use it more than two times a day.

(3) Before going to bed in the evening, I simply rinse my face again with luke warm water for a few minutes.

**Important: Do not touch your face!** Otherwise you would detroy the layer of applied cream. But I think that is mandatory, isn't it?

Yes my acne is older than most of you (okay, all of you.) And I know complaining about acne is nothing new, but after 25 years of battling it I feel like there's gotta be an underlying cause that I just can't put my finger on (and squeeze the hell out of!) Here I am, female, 38 years old, and still being plagued by the exact same skin problems that made me avoid social interaction and contributed greatly to my low self-esteem all throughout my teenage years, my twenties, and now most of my thirties.  The dermatologists always told me it'd go away with age... ok so by when, my 80s?? It just seems that at my age it should be a non-issue. Having to fight acne and wrinkles at the same, WTF! Yeah I know, it totally sounds like a doozie of a first world problem, ""I got pimples, wahhhhh!""

In all honesty, my acne isn't severe, just really persistent and ever present (see links to pics above). I can't ever recall not having a pimple face (aside from the time I was on Accutane mentioned below), nor has the level of acne diminished since its onset as a teen. It's extremely embarrassing at my age, and I have turned down social invitations and avoided people because of it.  Being recently divorced and single again, the idea of being ""out there"" with a pizza face is absolutely horrifying, and I'd probably just prefer staying home redditing my Friday nights away like tonight (not that there's anything wrong with that!) But still, there's that part of me that yearns to go out and have fun for once without wondering if people are staring at my pimple villages.   

Some background info:

- Tried a multitude of topical medications throughout the last 25 years, both over the counter and prescription (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, Retin-A, Differin, cleansers, astringents, lotions, etc.) Nothing really helped significantly. A lot of this stuff just burned my acne and made it look a thousand times worse. No long-term improvements.

- Used Proactiv on and off over the last 10 years.  Seems to always help in the beginning, but my skin would always overrule it after a couple of months and pimple-up again. Also tried some Proactiv knock-offs like AcneFree.  Also tried Nature's Cure which is a homeopathic approach that you take orally (you can buy it at Wal-Mart in the acne aisle). Still zitty, still shitty.

- 2 years ago I was at my wit's end and finally went to see my derm to ask about Accutane. Man, you would not believe how highly regulated this stuff is, you need to go on birth control pills, take monthly blood tests, and take an online test every month that's intended to remind you how Accutane damages babies. This was serious stuff, so I was convinced this was the cure-all of my malady and I was so excited when my dermatologist agreed to start me on the program (yes, there's actually a program). I think I was on accutane for about 4 months, just a single dose per day. During that time I could not believe the transformation of my skin: soft, oil-free, 100% blemish-free, and like porcelain. I had never been so happy in my life! I felt like it was a new dawn, and I was ready to (literally) face the world with a new found confidence.  Sadly.... after I was done with the Accutane program the acne just came back within a month or two. I was crushed. I know I could try it again, and maybe take it for longer or a larger dose, but Accutane is a dangerous medication and I'm not sure if I'm willing to risk my health any further for my vanity.

- I cannot do oral antibiotics (e.g., Tetracycline) because I'm allergic to many antibiotics out there. I know of only one or two that I can take safely, and of those I need to limit my intake so as not to develop an immunity to them.

- Yes I've tried the pillowcase trick I learned here on reddit (using a clean pillow case every night.) Of course it didn't work for me or else this post would not exist!

Overall I am very healthy, of normal weight, I never eat fast food, meat only 2-3 times a week, and my diet is rich in fruits and veggies. I love dairy, but when I stopped dairy for awhile I noticed no change in my skin. I'm not aware of any food allergies, but could acne be a sole symptom of being allergic to something I eat regularly? When I do exercise (once in awhile) my acne just gets a lot worse because of all the sweat (great excuse for not exercising! It causes zits!)

And lastly, my acne is not cystic (not the huge underground painful lumps) but more comedogenic (whiteheads and blackheads that evolve into hideous red bumps that eventually become poppable- if I'm lucky). I have oily skin, and I get acne on my face, my neck, my hairline, my back, and my chest. In other words, everywhere. It's gross.

I am open to anyone's suggestions or comments or recommendations to try new things.

Products with salicylic acid or BP, help some with breakouts but leave my face looking so red and irritated that they're not worth it. 

So about 3 months ago I was browsing for acne creams and came across Alpha Lipoic Acid as a topical treatment. Conveniently, I already had a bottle of 100mg pills, but had never heard of it being used as a topical treatment for acne, only as a supplement for exercising. I decided to give it a shot. 

I use it before bed and in the morning. What I do is dampen a tissue a bit and wet my face. Then I gently twist open one of the capsules (don't pull or powder will get everywhere) and empty it onto the damp tissue. I then massage the powder all over my face and neck, and then rinse all the excess powder off. You may feel a slight burning sensation, that's normal. After drying, I apply moisturizer, I use Vaseline for men, the fast absorbing kind with the green logo, but any moisturizer should be find. 

I've been using it for about 3 months now and the biggest difference I notice is the feeling it gives my skin. Just a few minutes after using it my skin feels wonderfully clean, calm, and not dry or irritated at all like with SC and BP. The feeling after is hard to describe, my skin really feels amazing after using it. My acne is clear, my face isn't red and it may even be helping to prevent razor burn on my neck. However, I've been using an after shave oil which is probably doing more of the work in preventing razor burn.

21M, been prone to acne my entire teenaged years. During high school I would get it all: surface redness, whiteheads, and even the deep in the skin ones on my jaw line. Started using ProActive during college, and it more or less cleared up. I would still get the occasional two or three pimples breakouts once every few weeks, but that was it.

Cut to a year ago, I left to go study abroad in Bonn, Germany. Within weeks of getting there, my acne completely vanished. No major lifestyle (stress, sleep, diet) changes that I can think of. I even stopped using ProActive.

Fast forward six months to August 2011 and I move back here in Madison, Wisconsin. I've more or less returned to the same level of of acne problems if not worse. Occasional to constant breakouts of 2-3 pimples on my cheek bones and forehead with a tinge of redness returning.

This has me completely baffled. I am forced to believe something is irritating my skin here in the US that wasn't in Germany. Has anyone else experienced this, or have some insight as to what the deal on this is?

Might it have been a food additive that's not used in Germany? Or climate? Or some product that I am using (shampoo, laundry detergent, body wash) that would irritate my skin?

I dampen my face with warm water, sometimes I use steam to open up my pores.

I apply Burt's Bees Peach and Willowbark Deep Pore Scrub to my entire face, then use my fingers to exfoliate for thirty seconds. 

Afterwards I wash it off with warm water then apply Neutrogena's Oil Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Wash on my entire face. I massage it into my face for thirty seconds then wash off.

I dab my face with a paper towel but leave it slightly damp. I then massage two or three drops of bio-oil onto my face. It soaks into my skin and doesn't leave any shine. After the bio-oil I apply a dime sized amount of Black Rice face cream with SPF15. Here are the pictures taken directly after the regimen: [Acne without make-up](http://imgur.com/a/oWvNu#0)

I've minimized the use of make-up. I use a very small drop of Neutrogena's Oil Free Makeup and apply it only to my problem areas with a brush. Here's how it looks like: [Acne with make-up](http://imgur.com/a/Uplq0#0)

My biggest issue is redness and what I think are blackheads. My chin area is the biggest problem area because it can get dry and flaky even after moisturizer.

 A lot of people have said drinking eight glasses of water a day would help with the skin. For the past three days or so I've been doing exactly that and I've seen a slight improvement. If in the next two weeks I see dramatic results then I'll update you guys. Feel free to ask any questions. 

Edit: If anyone is curious as to why I wash my face twice, it's because I feel like my skin gets clogged easily(which leads to flakiness) so I use the Burt's Bees wash for exfoliation. After exfoliation I use another face wash to clean out the pores and to clear any dead skin that's left on my face. Oh, and I only have redness and acne on the lower half of my face. The upper part is pretty clear and tame.

I'm 26f. I always had acne growing up, starting around 14, but I don't remember it as this bad. For the past few years I was on Yaz birth control, but switched to the Mirena IUD in 2010. Four months after I switched, I started breaking out horribly, and it's cystic, to make it all worse. And I'm a picker, even worse.
I know it's the worst thing to do to pick or force a cyst to pop. They destroy all the skin around and get twice as big and take twice as long to heal.
I have one on my smile line so bad right now, I had to cancel two dates this weekend...goddammit. It's like the size of half a dime...huge, disgusting scab right by my mouth. I feel like a freak. I can't even look anyone in the eye. I have meetings at work, clients to meet, and my face looks like I have a flesh eating disease on it.
I wear full makeup, which only makes it worse during the day, because it's bleeding and pussing - then I wash immediately when I get home and overtreat it...with steam, sea salt, tea tree oil, ice, calamine lotion, whatever I have around. I go almost into a panic state and freak out for hours, all the while I can't go outside because I don't want anyone to see.

It's not every day I'm like this - sometimes I don't get cysts for weeks,  then all of a sudden - bam - I get 2, 3, 4, 5, sometimes one pops up right next to another. I had a wound so bad on my chin, the scar changed the shape of my chin's actual outline when it healed.
And I have pink scars all over my goddamn face.

I have a high-deductible insurance plan, so a dermatologist would be out of pocket for me. Goddammit - my last job had such a better plan, why didn't I just fucking go?!?
I met a woman once, who told me she started breaking out for the first time ever around my age, and is now on 4 different medications every day just to stay clear - in her 40s.
I have a feeling this is just incurable - my mother has adult acne, and my sisters have it, too, just not as bad as me.

I've been on Spironolactone, taken Proactiv, taken vitamins and herbs and used Clarisonic, every natural remedy you can think of, drank vinegar, and even tried tanning my face clear. Nothing works.

I'm so sick of this. My face is being ruined with each new cyst, scarred and disfigured and ruined.
I'm going to see an accupuncturist this weekend - I want to try everything, so this is next. After that I guess I'll go broke seeing a dermatologist and getting Accutane, because I just don't know what else to even try.

Wash face with St. Ives apricot scrub, apply witch hazel toner all over my face, then moisturize with Aveeno SPF 15 ultra-calming moisturizer.

I do the same thing as in the morning. However, instead of using the moisturizer and retin A, I will use benzoyl peroxide all over my face.

I take a multivitamin and fish oil pills. I run every other day and shower as soon as I finish running. I have oily skin. Sadly, I'm also a picker.

So,I stumbled on this subredit by accident and i decided to post how I got rid of my acne because I wasn't able to find any post related to this medicine I used.Hope this will help you.

Back in my teenager years I had a pretty bad case of acne,tried everything,from solutions,to diet and magic tricks heard from people or found on internet.Nothing worked,I felt repulsive,feared to go outside of my house because of people judging me (was all in my head,of course).But then,a family friend,who was working as a pharmacist told me that she heard about some pills made in England that had some good reviews from the users and that it would be a good idea to give it a try.And thanks to The Universe,Budha,God,Zeus,Odin, Krishna,Old Gods and the New Gods, I did.

It is called Sotret (20mg and 10mg) and to get it,you might need a prescription (I didn't. Yay for 2nd world countries.). In one week my face was clear.Cleaner than I was before puberty.I was so happy back then,laughing all day,HUGE boost of confidence.

I got my hands on Sotret 20mg,one pill a day was enough for me.I heard some people where taking 2 ,might depend on how bad the acne is.It worked for me,worked for my friends,I was happy.

Some side effects where dehydration,my lips where very chapped.You need to drink a lot of water while taking this,I didn't,stupid me.
Some say that it might put  you in a state of depression.I had no such problems,probably because I was happy about my acne being gone.
Also,after you stop taking the pills,the acne might appear again.When I stopped taking them,the acne came back ,but not like before.It was nothing serious,one here,one there.
It does have a bigger list of side effects,some people could get the effects,some not.So be careful.
If you decide to try it,do some research,talk with a dermatologist and see if he recommends it for you.I have not talked with any specialist about it.It was a risk,but well worth it.

That's about it.Hope this will help you as it helped me.

I've never had any issues with my skin what so ever, but about 4-6 months back I started getting the occasional pimple, I started picking on it and it became a habit for me to pick on my skin. I would pick on it almost daily. Gradually I started getting more pimples and I kept picking on it. Often I even used sharp objects to help pop a pimple or to get a sebum plug out. This continued to about 2 months back when I understood that I may be doing permanent damage. I still picked on my skin but I was more careful. 

Two weeks ago I decided not to ever pick on my nose again, now the only stress that my skin takes is a daily shower and also 1-2 times a day I wash my face. My skin never used to be oily but never dry either, now it gets oily after 1-2 hours after washing it and it's especially oily in the morning. My skin also used to be very smooth but now it feels really uneven and there are bumps in it.

Here are some pictures after 2 weeks of no picking.

Left side:http://i.imgur.com/5Ff3D1F.jpg?1

I've sought out a dermatologist, and received a few different pills and associated lotions.  This year, I was on minocycline with acanya gel, and now sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin.  The latter pair seems to be working out pretty well, but I'm still getting these massive things under my skin that take around a month to start and finish, and then they just come back.  Every time I get them, they're bigger.  I have them on my jawline, in the center of my cheek, and one that fills up all of the space in my temple.

Honestly, what the hell is this, and why does nobody else get them?  I wash my face all the time.  I have a hard time imagining it's a clogged pore, because it starts under the skin and doesn't have a clear opening.

I don't want to go on Accutane because of it's insane side effects.  I'm already subject to depression as it is, walking around in public like this.  Scrolling through this sub I have to chuckle as people freak out about what I've had for years, and had to deal with every morning.  Seriously, I hardly remember what it was like not having acne.  Suicidal tendencies have been ongoing, and I can't imagine what effects Accutane might have.",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_1h5tcu,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1h5tcu/massive_undertheskin_pustules/,

I was on Clindoxyl for a year and a bit and that almost completely cleared it up minus a zit here or there and some blackheads on my nose. I stopped using it cold turkey a months ago (which I now gather was dumb) because I didn't want to be overexposed to antibiotics, and since then my skin has been a disaster.

I think I overreacted at first and overwashed, so my skin got super dry and bumpy, especially my forehead. Then my cheeks started breaking out a lot and I got blackheads and cystic acne on my chin, which I've never had before. I also (very stupidly) used Bio Oil at one point for a week or so, which I then found out was mineral oil that completely clogs your pores, so I'm sure that didn't help. I also tried some Neutrogena SA wash and it dried my skin out like crazy so I stopped using that.

Anyway, I went to my GP and he prescribed me Differin, since he said it was antibiotic-free, cus of my previous concern. I read up on it, though, and don't want to wait 3 months for any effect, so I want to use it in conjunction with Clindoxyl, which I still have a prescription for.

Is it smart to use them both at the same time? Should I be doing alternating nights, or one in the morning and one at night?

I'm also using Spectro Jel to wash (once in the morning, once at night) and Cetaphil SPF 15 moisturizer morning and night. Not sure if I should be exfoliating.  Sometimes I also use pure aloe vera to reduce redness and inflammation and to dry out particularly stubborn pimples. 

My acne is mostly whiteheads, some bumps that are only noticeable in sunlight (but are REALLY noticeable in sunlight), and these weird pieces of hard sebum (kind of like little skin tags) that form that are really easy to take off. Not really sure what they are.

Any help would be much appreciated.",,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,,True,t3_1g6fd1,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1g6fd1/differin_clindoxyl_also_general_help/,
1370612774.0,2,self.acne,1fuzwe,My acne experience,MotAle,4,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1fuzwe/my_acne_experience/,"Hello guys,
I've been reading some of your post about acne and I totally understand the struggle and embarrassment that someone is been trough.
I suffered of cystic acne for months before to find the causes and the solutions.
I hope to don't bother anyone with my experience but I want to share it because maybe can be useful for someone.

Everything started to get very bad one year ago.
Biggest components causes: stress and hormone imbalance.
Now I've been able to manage the stress easily but the hormone imbalance remained for a quite long time because was impossible find a cause and a solution.
Obviously things change from male to female, reason why is very important go to see a specialist doctor, dermatologist.

After the Accutane possibility I decide to go trough different medications. I did not wanted to risk that much for some acne! No way! So I start this process.
I've been under antibiotics medications for 2 month. the med was MINOCYCLINE.I did not prolong the use of this med at 4 months because after 2 months I had visible and GREAT results.
I am still using daily two lotio
day= ERYTHROMYCIN- BENZOYL PEROXIDE topical gel
night= TRETINOIN CREAM
Both of this lotions are great. There is no need of huge quantity, just a little bit and I've been able to see great improvements!

It is sad to realize that even doctor do not know exactly why acne happen and find a cure is a guess, reason why some products work perfectly for someone and reveal to be totally useless for others.

1. Do not rely on product that you can find in place like walmart, cvs or walgreens. Some of the ingredients just make it worst! Too much chemicals can arm your skin causing a chain reaction of irritation, sentitive skin+more acne=more probles.
When I was still in Italy I used EAU THERMALE AVENE brand, a cleanance gel with no soap. WONDERFUL! no skin irritation EVER!
Now I am in U and I wasn't able to find this product so I rely on Neutrogena gel soap tat works pretty well.
Two or 3 times at week I use a scrub soap. 
After washing my face I put some peroxide on a cotton ball and this help me a lot to maintain my face clean, especially now that In Vegas start to be dry and hot.

But after all the medication and cleaning process I decide to bring some changing in my diet.

2-Eating habit
I am taking ALOE VERA at least once a day. Same thing with green tea. More toxins you have inside and better it is. Not just for acne, but yes it helped me a lot!

No more sugars of any type. I was addicted to chocolate. I needed to rid off. Enough said that every time that I indulge on some chocolate a breakout appears the day later. Coincidence? Mha!

As I said before I had huge hormone imbalance. I took pills for years and I was never able to fix it definitely, without talking about the amount of weight gained during the assumption of the pill. Oh My! So, thanks to my amazing doctor in Italy and with some research that I've done I discovered two very important facts that changed my life and my battle against acne.

Even if you will never believe it, once I rid off meat from my diet I start to retrieve balance in my hormonal level. Unfortunately the hormones contained in the meat affect your body. Believe or not, this is the truth. Is happened to me. Maybe it does not affect everyone but it did it to me.
And I loved eat meat. Especially barbecued ones!
But...
after that I quit eat meat I needed to take under control the amount of protein intake. I rely on lean protein (beans) but do not take big amount of tofu or soy milk, especially if you are a woman/girl. Huge amount of processed soy is going to messed up you hormones too!

Another factor the contribute at my hormones imbalance was my sleeping habits. For one year my circadian cycle was abnormal and a lot of your of weakness during the night and sleep during the day is bad. During the night and during the sleep our brain produce the melathonin that contribute in hormone balance/imbalane. Now I ave my schedule 6.00 am awake. sleepy night night at 22.00/23.00.

3. make up. less you use better it is. Oh yes, after the first day of total shame to go out from the house you will tart to understand how your skin will thank you for do not put make up on it every day. Even the best one is goin to clog you pores or  irritate your skin.

Btw guys,
I hope my experience will be useful for some of you. Now after 9 months of all of this I can declare my self free from acne. 
And please don not struggle if you see some break out right before your period. IT IS NORMAL! every girls have it. Maybe in less quantity but everyone does. And acne during adolescence is normal. 
Rememeber if you stressed out for your acne is goin to get worse. stress affect acne because stress affect your hormones! Some work out will be your best ally for this battle!
Trust me!

:)

1370403570.0,5,self.acne,1fp70z,My story of dealing with acne and what I believe works and doesn't work.,ur2fat4u,7,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1fp70z/my_story_of_dealing_with_acne_and_what_i_believe/,"Hey everyone, let me just start off this post by saying that this community has really helped me deal with my acne. I've have had acne since the fifth grade when I got my first pimple and soon I'll be entering my second year of college. That's more than 8 years of living with acne. From fifth grade to tenth grade my acne was bad, very bad. I would not only get little bumps but I would get HUGE pimples on my nose and it left me with terrible self confidence issues. 

Over the 8 years of living with acne, I have tried everything. From fifth grade until tenth grade I tried face masks, tea tree oil and every single over the counter product except Pro- Activ. None of these things really worked except the tea tree oil which helped reduce my acne by a little but it really dried out my skin. After tenth grade my mom finally took me to see a dermatologist, for all those years she refused to take me because she always thought that prescription drugs were never the answer and she wanted to try every natural remedy there was like face masks and tea tree oil. 

When I went to the dermatologist he prescribed Tazorac and Duac to me. This was the first time I've ever seen any improvement in my skin and I was so incredibly happy. The huge pimples became less frequent and the little red ones and white heads decreased by a bit. But eventually my skin stopped clearing up and I still had a lot of acne left. That's when I then switched to antibiotics and Benzaclin. 

During the eleventh grade I was taking Benzaclin and Tetracycline (antibiotic) and they were great! My skin was finally clearing up, I felt my confidence coming back and everything felt right. But then my Tetracycline prescription was up and my mom was very persistent for me to stop taking the antibiotics because she doesn't want my immune system to be weakened. The acne started to come back and once again I felt hopeless. At this point it's been almost six years with acne and I felt like such a freak as everyone in my school had perfect skin and they would complain about the smallest zit. I envied these people and I wished that something would work. 

In the twelfth grade of high school I really tried to change my daily habits and I did some research. I went back to my dermatologist and he prescribed to me Differin .3 and Doxycycline (antibiotics). Let me just say that the Differin really helped even after I stopped taking the Doxycycline. I was ecstatic and felt really confident in my self. But I not only changed up my medication but also what I ate, my exercise routines and the amount of water I drank. 

Senior year was very stressful for me because I was class president and I had to plan many events and fundraisers in a short amount of time and there were many nights where I would get stressed out and get a few hours of sleep. My acne was definitely linked to stress because all throughout middle school and high school I had a high course load and I would stay up incredibly late. My outlet senior year was working out. I went to the gym 5 times a week and worked out different areas of my body each day. Not only that but I cut out every single junk food there was. I can't remember the last time I had soda when I wasn't drinking (chasers). 

There is no simple solution to acne and I understand what you guys are going through but I hope that my solutions can help you guys out. 

**What I do**

* Exercise regularly! Not only will you be doing your body a huge favor but you will also feel incredible about your body and gain some confidence

* Drink plenty of water! I found this out more recently after a trip to Florida. In Florida it was incredibly hot and I was drinking almost a gallon of water a day. When I came back, I couldn't help but notice how clear my skin was getting and I still continue this habit of drinking water. I don't mean just 6 to 8 cups, I mean way more than that. I'm not talking about mixing in powder either, I mean straight up water maybe with some orange slices in it. 

* Take a look at your diet and cut out the greasy, fatty and sugary foods. Ever since I started eating clean the results on my face have been nothing short of amazing. If you feel like you need to eat a bag of chips, grab a banana! If you're in the mood for something sweet like chocolate or ice cream, grab some greek yogurt!

* For the love of God, please go see a dermatologist. All the above suggestions had a huge impact but I believe that the medication I am taking (Differin .3) is working wonders. 

I really hope all these suggestions have helped you guys in some way. I know a lot of the shit that I said is repetitive but unless you make a serious decision to change your habits, you're not going to see any difference in your skin. 

** One More Thing **

Cigarettes and Alcohol suck. During a night of drinking, I will smoke an occasional cigarette. The toxins you put into your body from alcohol and cigarettes are terrible for your health and your skin. Try to make it a habit to not smoke and drink. If you do drink or smoke then do it less.

Ok here’s my deal, 31 year old male. Did not have acne problems until 24 years old. its been 7 years and I am now 31 and still dealing with acne. I have been to 4 different dermatologist and tried countless gels, creams face washes, shampoo's etc. I have gone to an allergist (I am allergic to dust, mites, pollen, cats &amp; dogs) and an endocrinologist (levels looked fine except a little low on vitamin d). 

I am really not sure what to do anymore to get rid of my adult acne. Dermatologist says it’s not bad enough for accutane but I have slowly tried to get off the gel's and such but i start to break out again once I do.

I am really at a loss of what to do and this battle with acne has left me with zero self-confidence and really made me recluse in life. I was a fun person who was always out enjoying the sun rays in the summer but now I try to avoid the sun or wear a hat and just kind of hide my face because the acne and scars bum me out.

Between an internist, endocrinologist, and 4 dermatologist I would have thought we could find the root cause and i would be clear by now. None of them seem to think it was strange I had clear skin until the age of 24 then it was onset. There was some traumatic things that happened in my life around then but I don’t see how it stayed with me.

At this stage I don't know what to do anymore... I can’t think of another doctor to see to figure out my issues and my skin seems it’s just becoming more and more oily, probably from all these products I have used. I had perfectly normal skin and now I feel it’s ruined. 

Does anyone have any recommendations of what I can possibly due to try to finally rid myself of acne?

There's my progress picture. The before picture (left) was taken on a ""better"" day. But usually I would just cleanse and exfoliate my face in the morning and night time. My back is/was a LOT worst than my face. Breakouts would usually be the worst before and during my lady time, so I knew when to expect it.

I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed me some stuff and I was skeptical but after a good month or so I really started to see results. I take:


MINOCYCLINE, which is an oral medication that is an antibiotic that stops the acne-causing bacteria and helps with the inflammation. (Twice a day on an empty stomach with lots of water)


DIFFERIN, which is a topical medication (I have the gel) that helps heal and control acne. (Just for my face, at night)


TAZORAC, which is a lotion that basically acts as a mini chemical peel which helps the size and redness of large cystic acne. (Just for my back, in the morning and at night)


CLINDAMYCIN, which is a topical solution for severe acne (Just for my back in the morning or at night, I rotate because it's very strong)


SCARZONE, which is a topical cream with SPF 15 in it that you can get at Fred Meyer, or any grocery store, for about $10. It helps face scars (which takes a lot longer).


I also drink a lot of WATER, go on walks for exercise and eat super super healthy (I'm also on a gluten-free diet because of a wheat sensitivity). I heard that dairy can cause acne so I cut it our completely and switched to soy/almond milk, soy cheese, and take vitamin D and calcium supplements (which I hear also helps).

I have never really had a problem with face acne in my teens (or currently) but have always suffered with back/chest acne. I would describe it as covering a good portion of my back, shoulders and chest area; and moderate in severity. 

I have tried various acne treatment options off the shelf of pharmacy's and none of which seem to work. Cleansing pads with sialic acid and acne treating body washes do not seem to work. The only thing I have noticed to provide a temporary fix is to sunbathe! Walking around in the heat of the sun seems to shrink the size of my acne but it always returns when the weather gets colder.
I have noticed that my back and chest sweat a good amount when exercising also.

Are there any products that I may have overlooked that I should try before consulting a dermatologist? (I have a fear of doctors; constantly feel embarrassed)

I recently decided to try and avoid dairy.

Voila!

Zero whiteheads in the past two months, OTHER than when I eat dairy, and then with 100% reliability I'll notice the effects within the next 3 days.

**Tips to test for yourself:**

* Avoid ALL substantial dairy for a week. Then you can start forgiving things like small amounts of dairy sauces or stuff cooked with butter.

* Watch your skin the 2-3 days after you eat dairy.

**Summary**

* I'm super glad to have done this.
* Is there anything else that might cause it for me, given that dairy does?
* Are there any supplements I could take before/after consuming dairy to reduce the effect? I'm assuming the reason dairy causes it is due to the insulin spike dairy causes. There are definitely supplements that can blunt insulin spikes.

**You!**

Given how awesome this has been for me, I'm considering trying to help others. I'm a web developer and Computer Science student, and I'd love to try and make something that helped people identify if dairy correlated with their acne, or possibly identify other things that did.

I've had real bad acne since I was about 14 (I'm 22 now). My skin has improved greatly over the past year or two and I just wanted to share what I've been using.

First off, I was taking Othro Tri-cyclen for about a year. My skin was the BEST it's ever been! Unfortunately I had to switch brands, as the hormones were making me really depressed. Everyone is different though, so I think its worth a shot. I'm now taking Microgestin Fe, on my 4th month and so far my moods are better and my skin isn't as great as it was on Ortho, but still better than without birth control. The 2nd week of the month is the oiliest for some reason.


My topical medications are Atralin, and a cream of benzoyl peroxide/sulfur 6% and 3%. Both I've been using for 2 years. They're decent, but if you have dry skin you may want to avoid Atralin. As far as I can tell, both of these medicines are meant to keep your skin from getting oily. Atralin made me peel/itch a bit when I first started but my skin has adjusted and it is pretty helpful now when I'm having an oily week.


Lastly, I ALWAYS use Cetaphil as a face wash, nothing else. First time I got it I was amazed at how gentle it is. Doesn't dry my skin out but also gets the job done. I seriously would recommend it to anyone, no matter if you have super oily or dry skin. I don't use any moisturizers because they still make me break out.


Hope this helps, I know everyone's skin is different but cystic acne is a real pain (literally) so I figured I'd tell you guys my experience. I'm glad this sub exists, I've already learned that Vitamin D has helped a lot of you so I think I will be picking some up soon.. :)

I had some mild acne as a teen, but found a regimen that worked and was basically acne free for years until this past winter when I took a break from the regimen and starting breaking out again. But even after a couple of months of going back to the regimen and modifying it, it's still just as bad if not worse.

Here's what I'm currently doing:

Morning-sulfer/sulfacetamide wash (which used to work wonders), moisturize, a good BHA (substituted for a clindamycin/BP lotion that stopped being effective)

Night-Sulfer/sulfacetamide wash, moisturize, 0.1% tretinoin

I have been drinking fluoride-free water for a few weeks, have completely changed my diet to no dairy (few months), lower simple carbs (few weeks), vegetables/spinach salad every day, fruit (not too much), fish and fish oil supplements, lean meats, vitamin d supplements (since I haven't been in the sun much). I have tried other supplements like B complexes and zinc, but they either don't help or make me break out more. I change my pillowcase fairly frequently, although I am a face sleeper. I work out fairly regularly, and am a pretty healthy guy in general. I use a manuka honey mask on my face most nights as well, and this seems to help with the inflammation, but I don't know how effective it really is.

Some of these things definitely seem to help. When I ate primarily salads and lean meats for a while I started to clear up, but it's extremely difficult for me to eat only these things for every meal, and do not have that option. Plus it's extremely hard to bulk up/put on any sort of mass on a diet like this. I guess I'm just kind of at the end of my rope. It's so discouraging to be eating very healthy and seemingly doing all the right things and then I wake up with a few more pimples. Fuck that.

So nothing really new here but I just wanted to point that out because it seems that people have 1000 ways of avoiding acne, e.g. after shave, supplements, not-picking-your-face, fresh pillow every night, ... 
My point is that people who don't have issues with acne do not care about those things and still don't get acne. Some have a shitty diet, do not workout that much and they change their pillow every 2 weeks or even later and they don't wash their face other than what is done by taking a shower and they also touch the face all the time and they smoke and and and.. 

So having acne post puberty is clearly a sign of being sick one way or another right?

I've recently started something of a routine in how I clean my face and I wanted to bring this up to you all as a potential method. So far, it works for me but I hope it is applicable to those out there too.

The theory behind what I'm doing is scientific (as a biologist, I do my best to keep it so); I tackled the questions of what directly causes acne and what indirectly causes acne.

As you may know, P. acnes is the bacteria that facilitates the formation of acne by opening up pores to further infection. I have tried caustic agents to kill this bacteria, but acne kept returning. I then realized that there are indirect reasons why this was happening. Even the treatments that severely dry out my skin wouldn't help kill these. Also the formation of acne is manifested by an inflammatory response in your skin, localized to pustules.

Although I didn't culture them, I speculated that my bacteria were either resistant to acne meds or were repopulating. I ruled out the former because I typically scrub my face in addition to using chemicals. The latter must be true because I do have a tendency to touch my face.  The bacteria were coming from my hand. So I came up with this:

-Wash my face to clean the area of dirt and general microorganisms. 

-Use H2O2 or hydrogen peroxide or some antimicrobial to kill what was on my face. Air-dry - this is important because you need to give the H2O2 time to work.

-Wash hands with hand sanitizer or soap and then use water to moisturize face. I used distilled water at first but I think regular tap works too.

-Let the water dry off sort of and use a clean towel to get the rest off (I change out my towels regularly).

-Add an anti-inflammatory like salicylic acid (I use Burt's bees) to reduce any pre-existing or forming inflammation.

-Apply a topical moisturizer. I cannot stress how important it is to disinfect your hands before this. This is also important if you have oily skin. The peroxide will dry out your skin and may lead to oversecretion of oils, which is why the moisturizing steps are necessary. I use an aloe-based lotion, so my skin doesn't try out and it creates a heavy barrier for any bacteria that may fall in.

Anyway, it's been about three weeks since I started and my skin has been pretty clear. I just wanted to share this with everyone.

Although a lot of the acne has healed, my forehead's been left red, with little bumps scattered about. Does anyone know how I can fix this (preferably without chemical peels/laser?)? And will it go away over time (and if so, when)?

I'd say the redness is a bigger issue than the bumps (since my liquid foundation's coverage is pretty light and just covers the redness, but the bumps remain).

My skincare regimen: Shiseido cleanser, moisturizer (sometimes brightening cream is used before moisturizer) x 2 daily

1367277278.0,4,self.acne,1dden5,My Accutane is over and I can only get a new box in 2 weeks..,jpereiramp,5,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1dden5/my_accutane_is_over_and_i_can_only_get_a_new_box/,"So, a little info about this whole situation:
I never had really bad acne, at all (I didn't even believe my Dr. when he prescribed me Accutane since the few people I knew that took it had REALLY bad acne). I had a few pimples and an oily skin, but nothing too bad. I started 6 months ago taking 20mg every other day and have followed this same routine until today.

My skin is super clear, no pimples or oil, nothing, to a point where I feel like I don't even need Accutane anymore, but still, my Dr. said that I would be on an 8 month cycle, so I need another box (1 box lasts 2 months for me).

The thing is, I only have 2 pills left and I'm traveling and won't be able to get a new box for 2 weeks. Is it okay if I suddenly stop the cycle for 2 weeks and then continue with it ?


**tl;dr:** My skin is already clear (like I'm done with the treatment, plus it was never too bad), my Dr. said I should do an 8 month cycle on Accutane, I just finished the 6th month but I'll only be able to get another box in 2 weeks. Is it okay or will it hurt my treatment ?
