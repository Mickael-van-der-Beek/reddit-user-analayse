You can only prevent people from dying once in their lifetime. For example, if someone is about to die from cancer, you can cure them instantly. If someone is about to get in a car accident, you can alter that situation instantly so they don't die even if you're not in proximity to them. Etc. You get notifications on who is about to die, and you have the choice to set limitations on who you get notifications from (i.e. just family and friends, particular people, people in your community, or a particular country, etc).

You can choose from:

1) Waking up every day to repeat one single day of your life. There is a random given day, that you will live for the rest of your life, you can't choose it. No matter what you do, the next morning you'll wake up how you would wake up normally on that day. You will have the memory from the previous days, so you will know you are stuck in loop. You would live like that for the rest of your life, based on your given life expectancy (if normally you would die at the age of 80, you would continue this loop for so many days, until you would have turned 80)

or...

2) Every morning you wake up to a random day of your life - for example one day you can wake up as a grandpa, the other day as a teenager. The actions that you do WILL change the future days you will possibly be waking up to. Your memory DOES NOT adjust - if you wake up as a teenager, you have no idea what have you been doing at the time unless you've been living some close day recently. It's like someone triggered a shuffle button on your life. Much like the first one, you would live through all of the days of your life - all of them, but only once for every one - and then die (again, based on your life expectancy)

Which one will you choose?

EDIT: Correcting a logical mistake here: Since actions from the 2) scenario can affect the future, the day of your death is given and you can do nothing to extend/shorten your life, even if it took a miracle to correct that.

Good:

* The book inspires you to write a very successful song, book, or act in a movie that instantly makes you a millionaire;

* You learn some fact that will save your life in a crisis situation, or that makes you win in some kind of a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?-type of a show;

* The book inspires you to finally start living the life you have always wanted to lead.

Bad:

* You become so obsessed with the book that you spend all of your time rereading it again and again, and watching all kind of related movies or cartoons, reading articles, etc., effectively stopping to live your life;

* You learn something that you have never wanted to learn, and that either endangers your life, or makes you heavily depressed or overly paranoid;

* You spend your life following what was written in the book, and in the end realize that you never believed it, and you have wasted your life doing something you hate.
