I play Rift for 2 Years and me and my friend always had to buy Gamecards from onlineshops with paysafecard because Rift is not supporting ELV ( The most popular online payment method in germany) and neither Paysafecard. You have to know that maybe 10% of Germans own a Credit Card so its not a Option for us and many people dont have or dont  want to use Paypal. Me and all of my friends that started playing now Have no option to support you and buy something in the Shop.

Please help us giving you Money trion and add a ELV or atleast Paysafecard option. Even before Rift went F2P many friends didnt Sub because there was no ELV, its a huge thing in germany and you are missing on a lot of Money if your not Supporting it like WoW for example.

Gather your friends in RIFT and play anywhere, any time

When the next major RIFT™ update hits early this summer, subscribers will be treated to a surprise – free character transfers. Trion Worlds announced today that with RIFT 1.3, players will have the ability to move to select servers in their territory once each week, taking all items, achievements, and titles with them. Additionally, guild leaders will be able to move their guild’s level and experience.

“MMOs are all about playing with your friends no matter which server they’re on, and that’s why we’re offering this as a free service to our subscribers,” said Scott Hartsman, Executive Producer. “RIFT is both a game and a service, and adding free server transfers is just one more way we can make this the best possible MMO experience available.”

Whether you want to play with friends, check out a new server, or avoid queue times on highly populated servers, you’ll be free to move about Telara. As a part of this grand experiment, there will initially be no limits on the number of times you can transfer your characters or guild.

Character transfers will remain a free service for the foreseeable future, and could become a permanent addition to the RIFT experience. Subscribers will be able to perform the transfers inside of the game itself once the patch is live.

The credit pricing is fantastic!",Hairyhoof,79,17,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1gzfpk/wow_well_done_trion_the_credit_pricing_is/,"Today I was reading about loyalty and the ways to earn it when I stumbled upon the pricing for credits. I felt a bit disappointed and slightly angry when I saw that $10 bought the same amount of credits as €10 - which is a pretty noticeable difference in value!

I started checking the value of dollars versus euros to find out how much Europeans were losing when I noticed that the amount of credits €10 bought was higher than that which $10 would buy. I was in game at the time so I thought maybe me being a patron was giving me more credits. But it wasn't. So I did the math and it turns out Trion is pretty fucking fantastic when it comes to pricing.

If you buy the small pack in the US, a single credit will cost you 0,6667 cents. And in Europe, it'll cost you 0,6707 cents per credit.

I just thought I would share this. I'm so proud of Trion and the momentary loss of faith in them has come back tenfold. Most companies (that I've noticed) usually screw over the Europeans by quite a bit. I'm proud to be a patron and I spent €10 on some credits to celebrate their achievements!

In all my years of being on the net / gaming i have never had a password hacked. The fact that it's happening in Rift and with such a large amount of people show there is something hinky going on.

There's more tips here as well as some info on the measures about to be introduced to prevent it happening in future. If it can happen to someone like myself that would consider myself fairly secure online it could happen to anyone.

[Lastly, it may be a good idea to sort comments by ""new"" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1itdvt/moronic_monday_july_22nd_2013_your_weekly/?sort=new). *Top 5 questions from these threads will go towards our future FAQ.*

We are currently one of the largest (maybe the largest?) guild on Sunrest, are the highest level (12) and we want to keep hold of that position! It is not uncommon to join a random group and see other Hivemindians in there with you! People are genuinely happy to have Hivemind members in their group due to our brilliant reputation in all level brackets. We provide a variety of both level 50 and 1-49 content to enjoy, whether that is PvP premades or dungeon groups. We are now actively raiding in an Alliance with Foes Watch, hitting up GSB and RoS every Thursday and Monday.  
  
But, due to our largely expanding numbers we would like to make a final push to be able to raid as a guild. We have already raided Gilded Prophecy (10-man) as a guild, but not since 1.3 hit so we may have a little more luck than we were pre-1.3, and we want to make the next step as a guild and start raiding the 20 man content. Raid hours and days are still being discussed and will probably occur at roughly 5pm PST on the days we decide. We are also still taking members from all level brackets so come join us!  
  
The only requirements to join the raid is to be adequately geared and you must want to have fun. The only requirement to join Hivemind is a reddit account (Needed to get promoted above Lurker status). Feel free to /who Hivemind in game to ask for an invite.

**Why use them?**  Generally they allow for some optimal customization.  This works well in a game like Rift which does not allow add-ons but has a ton of abilities to let you make some shortcuts to save on keybinds or help with healing targeting.  
    
**Where do I find this option?** In Rift, you can either go to the Menu options and bring up the Macro menu or simply type /macro.  You will see a list on the side of several empty icon boxes.  You click on one, rename the title and then in the area beneath you can write your macro.
     
**How do I write a macro?** Macros are fairly simple in concept.  The most basic of them is ""cast [Ability Name]"".  So if I wanted to write a macro to cast Healing Breath, I would simply write
    
&gt;cast Healing Breath
     
Each line of a macro is separated by a line break.  So with multiple commands to chain them you would write:
    
&gt;cast Healing Breath
    
&gt;cast Healing Grace
     
**So I can chain my entire rotation to one button?  Neato Burrito!** Not exactly.  You can not chain multiple abilities to one button press.  Nor can you chain a rotation exactly.  What you can do is set a priority list by cooldown.  Basically in the macro above, Healing Breath has an 8 second cooldown.  It will attempt to cast Healing Breath and if it is able to, it will.  If not, it will move to the next spell on the list, Healing Grace.  It will ONLY cast Healing Grace if Healing Breath is on cooldown.  
     
**How does this work for Reactive abilities or follow ups?**: Pretty much the same way. 
     
&gt;cast Rising Waterfall

&gt;cast Power Strike
 
This will attempt to cast Rising Waterfall first.  When you start a fight you won't be able to since RW is a reactive ability.  So it will cast Power Strike.  The next time you press the button, you will able to cast RW though because it is now enabled by you using PS.
 
&gt;cast Path of the Wind

&gt;cast Power Strike
    
Because Path of the Wind has no restrictions, this macro would only recast that over and over.
    
&gt;cast Power Strike

&gt;cast Path of the Wind
    
This however, will cast PS if you are in melee range, but cast Path of the Wind if you are out of melee range.  
    
**So...about targets?** You are able to also customize targeting with macros.  There are a variety of things but they use an ""@"" modifier to indicate it is a target.  
    
&gt;cast @self Healing Breath
    
If you macro it, the macro would always cast Healing Breath on yourself, no matter who you have targeted.  Other options are:
    
&gt;@lasttarget [Your Last Target]

&gt;@mouseover [The target your cursor is over.  Great for healing]

&gt;@focus [Your focus target]
    
**Is there anything else I can do with them?** Lots!  But this is a beginner's guide.  Macros can do a lot of things, such as set targets, set focuses, marks.  There are some guides on the official forum if you get more curious.

You can either subscribe for $14.99 a month (larger packages bring monthly cost down) or you can buy the vouchers in the store for credits.

Now in my personal situation I was going to get a 3 month subscription for $38.97 but I noticed you get much more for your money if you buy credits and use the credits to buy Patron vouchers.  Instead I bought $50 in credits and got 3 30 day Patron vouchers.

Now why is this better?

* Subscribing only gives you 7000 Loyalty per month, while this method gives you 15,640 Loyalty per month (2160 credits at 4 Loyalty per credit + the base 7000 per month).
* Being a Patron will give you a 10% discount on buying more Patron vouchers.  You can buy 1 month at a time and still get 10% off but with subscribing you need to buy at least 3 months to get a discount.
* Patron subscriptions come with no credits, but with this method you have 2020 credits left over. However they are not 'free' since you paid $11.03 more for 8500 credits vs. 3 months Patron subscription.

So what does spending the extra $11.03 buy you?

* 2020 ""bonus"" credits every 3 months
* 8640 extra loyalty per month (over **double**)
* When you spend the other 2020 credits that gives you another 8080 loyalty points for a total of **34000 bonus loyalty over the 3 month period**.",Banter,False,self,t5_2s4an,False,riftbanter,,True,t3_1h0o1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1h0o1w/why_you_should_buy_patron_passes_from_the_store/,

Post your question - stupid or otherwise - here to get an answer. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer.

At Gamescom earlier this year, Trion treated me to an eyes-on of Storm Legion, with senior game designer Will Cook leading the tour. You can read about it in the article here: http://www.zam.com/story.html?story=30623

Only, I'd made a couple of errors. One was the launch date (13th, not 18th). The other was Cook's name. Throughout the article, I'd called him Woody instead of Will.

We caught the error the same day and got the article updated without a problem. In the weeks and months that followed, I'd forgotten about the mistakes I'd made on that day.

Until now. http://gazimoff.com/woody.jpg

Today I've learned two things: Trion have a great sense of humour, and they *always* get the last laugh...

(seriously),phorkor,45,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/yl5po/nice_job_trion_support_seriously/,"I played Rift from release to up to about 6 or so months ago. Came back for a few but just didn't have time to invest due to work and whatnot. Haven't played in over a month. 

Last Wednesday I went to cancel my subscription but I couldn't due to server maintenance and the website being inaccessible. The next day I had to go out of town so I couldn't do anything until I got back and also noticed that they charged me another month that same day. I emailed them, they said I needed to call so I could verify my account info. Today I did and was quite impressed with the service I got. Not only did I get a refund on this months payment, he said that he saw I didn't play all of last month and said he would also refund the previous month as well. I would have been content with just this months refund, but also giving last month was beyond what was expected or even thought of. 

Over the time I've played, I've head nothing but good things about Trion's support yet I never had to deal with them. Today, I was amazed by it. Playing WoW since second beta until about 7 months before Rift launched I had to deal with their support a few times. Every time it was a nightmare. It's nice to see that a company is capable of caring about it's customers even if they aren't able to play anymore and going the extra mile to keep them happy. 

Anyways, like I said, I've heard good things about their support and just figured I'd share another good story about Trion. Hopefully I can come back in the future because I will not have a problem giving them my money again. 

TLDR: I haven't played in over a month. Last week I tried to cancel, they were under maintenance and charged my CC. I called today, they refunded this month as well as last month since they saw I never logged in. Happy customer I am and hopefully will be back in the future.

Town was dead, aside from two guardians standing around, not looking terribly active, or interested in me. I get myself prepped, good to go, run north to start some questing, and make my first pull.

The instant I charge in, I see a blur from behind and my skill bar goes dark. I'm at 10% health before I get the chance to cast a spell, and my shield doesn't do anything. A warrior/rogue gank. I'm dead before I can even get mad. 

Whatever. I have thick skin. I can shrug this off. I had my soulwalk up, and even if I didn't I was within sight of the respawn point. The only thing that bothered me was that I was headed into the right side of Icewatch Outpost, and they went into the left. Not like we were competing for anything. But whatever, some people need to 2v1 to feel good about themselves.

Eventually I get my chunk of quests done and head back to town. As I'm leaving to head on to the next quest hub, I see the warrior, standing alone in the middle of town. Just standing there. I consider saying something, but I'm just ready to put the whole thing behind me and be done with it. So I tromp off on my turtle and don't even give him a glance.

Ten feet out of town, he charges me from behind. Oh, so you just make a habit of stabbing people in the back? I'm not going to just stand there like a chump, though. I'm stunlocked but he's taking me on alone, and I'm not the squishiest class in the game. 

GlacialShieldGlacialShieldGlacialShieldcomeoncomeonGlacialShieldGlacialShield*ohyeah*. I've got control back and still have a good chunk of health left, so I throw up some self heals and shields, and start going to town. My rotation is low on status effects but high on crits, and my soul combo gives me three shield spells that can absorb for 600-700 each, all on 30 second CDs. Whack Whack Whack. I'm getting hits off and my health is slowly climbing back up, and his is going in the only direction a warrior's can: down. It's close, I'm seeing grey, but he drops at the last second. 

I'm not going to lie. That felt good. My heart was racing, and I felt like I could walk away and consider myself avenged. But he respawns on the far side of town, takes a drink, and says, simply, ""again.""

What was he thinking? That I got lucky? He got the drop on me and I still brought him down in 1v1. So now he wants to fight with me knowing he's coming? Sure. Why not. 

I don't say a word. I just stand there. Wait for him to make his move. He charges and gets the stunlock on me again before my shield goes up, but it's the same story. I take plenty of hits, but you just can't beat an instant-cast self-heal every time you get crit. He goes down and I have an even bigger chunk of health left.

Respawns. Drinks. ""again.""

Seriously? Okay. Come at me. 

Whack whack whack whack. What's that sound? Oh, he's blocking my hits. He has a shield out. Hah, oh, he's changed to a tank spec? This'll be fun. whack heal shield whack heal shield. It takes a pretty long time, and I had to actually regen my mana back, but sure enough, he goes down, leaving me with a sliver of health.

Of course, that's when the rogue shows himself.

Pops out from stealth from behind me, and I frantically throw up my shield and go back into my routine. He's not letting me just get hits off. Actually dancing around so he's out of range. I'm not very good at dealing with that yet. But even so, I bring the rogue down to a tiny bit of health before I finally go down.

I pop back up on the far side of town. The Guardians are talking.

""We couldn't let someone like him live. Defiants aren't supposed to be that strong.""

Maybe I'm supposed to take that as a compliment, but all I read was, ""we're going to RP away the fact that we're assholes.""

Thick skin. Centering breath. They're just dicks. Nothing new. So I speak up, for the first time in our interactions together, and say, ""I may have been born in a tube, but I wasn't born yesterday.""

It stands for ""Ask Me Anything"", a popular sub-Reddit here on Reddit /r/IAMA is where individuals (and celebrities) can create new discussions about their life, job, whatever is on their mind and you can ask them anything (or almost anything.) The /r/Rift sub-Reddit moderation team has gone ahead and setup some AMA's that will be occurring in a couple of weeks with employees from Trion!

In the AMA, you’ll be able to ask them almost anything about Rift and their personal life. Of course, we are aware that some of the more popular questions will be Storm Legion related. Thus as a heads up, keep in mind that they are very limited on what responses they can give. The Trion Employees will be online throughout the day to answer your questions on the Rift sub-Reddit and will also have a special flair attached to their name.

The following is the schedule of upcoming AMA's on /r/Rift:


* July 26^th - James ""Elrar"" Nichols and Amanda ""Amary"" Fry,
* July 27^th - Elizabeth ""dahanese"" Tobey and Scott Hartsman.


----


The AMA's will be posted around 10AM PST, 12PM CST, 1PM EST. Don't ask me for GMT times, I have no clue! ;)

1376388464.0,32,self.Rift,1k9pz7,Infinity stone to-do list with bonuses,Frothy_Semenbeard,37,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1k9pz7/infinity_stone_todo_list_with_bonuses/,"/u/Linclin posted some info on ways to get a lot of infinity stones a day ago. I have been working on some notes on the subject and figured I'd share what I've put together as a list of things to do to get the most infinity stones each day.

There are 5 Ashora dailies, 6 Steppes dailies, and 6 Dendrome dailies that you can do yourself. These dailies each net 180 (before bonuses) infinity stones as a reward. 

Then you have 5 Dendrome onslaughts and 3 PvP (Dendrome or Steppes) daily quests that also can be done by yourself. These also net 180 infinity stones each. You can also do the 'close 3 hunt rifts' daily which gets you 350 infinity stones with an extra 90 stones for closing 3 of them.

Lastly, the chronicles 'A Hero's Rise' and 'Queen's Gambit' also net 180 infinity stones each (including expert marks) and do not count towards the daily limit. The chest in Queen's Gambit may also contain anywhere from 100-400 infinity stones. 

For content requiring groups/raids, there is the daily raid rift (450 stones), 'close 3 great hunt rifts' (450 stones + 90 for closing 3), 'defend 3 strongholds' (300 stones + 360 for defending 3), the 'kill 25 opposing faction players' daily (270 stones), and 4 Dendrome Group dailies (180 stones each.) From what I've seen of the pvp one, folks seem to just take turns spawn camping for the 25 kills.

So, the list that I try to do when I farm is the following:

* 1) Stronghold Assault 300+360 for defending 3 of them
* 2) Great Hunt Rifts 450+90 for closing 3 of them
* 3) Daily Raid Rift 450
* 4) Hunt Rifts 350+90 for closing 3 of them
* 5) PvP 25 Killer 270
* 6) Dendrome Daily 180
* 7) Dendrome Daily 180
* 8) Dendrome Daily 180
* 9) Dendrome Daily 180
* 10) Dendrome Daily 180
* 11) Dendrome Daily 180
* 12) Ashora Daily 180
* 13) Ashora Daily 180
* 14) Ashora Daily 180
* 15) Ashora Daily 180
* 16) Ashora Daily 180
* 17) Steppes Daily 180
* 18) Steppes Daily 180
* 19) Steppes Daily 180
* 20) Steppes Daily 180
* 21) Steppes Daily 180
* 22) Steppes Daily 180
* 23) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 24) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 25) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 26) Dendrome Onslaught Daily 180
* 27) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 28) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 29) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 30) Dendrome Group Daily 180
* 31) Hero's Rise Chronicle 180 (doesn't count as a daily)
* 32) Queen's Gambit Chronicle 180 (doesn't count as a daily)

If you do absolutely everything here, you can expect to see 7220 infinity stones from quests alone before bonuses. Pinning a time frame as to how long this would take is tough, since I tend to stop doing the solo ones and jump on zone events, DRR calls in crossevents/raids, etc. as they pop up.

From what I've seen, the currency bonuses work like this:

* F2P: no bonus
* Guild perk 'Cache Finder': +5% bonus
* Patron bonus: +15% bonus
* Lesser Token Tablet (from Store): +15% bonus
* Patron's Token Buff (daily refresh): +40% bonus
* Token Tablet (from Store): +40% bonus
* Greater Token Tablet (from Store): +80% bonus
* Orange tier loyalty perk Treasure Map: +10% bonus

~~I think with the exception of the tablets and the patron's token buff, bonuses stack. I don't know for sure because I never tried using a Greater Token Tablet with my patron buff.~~ So a F2Player in a guild with the 'cache finder' perk will see a +5% bonus on infinity stones. A Patron in the same guild using a Greater Token Tablet will see a +100% bonus. ~~If the GTT and patron's buff stack then the biggest bonus I see is +140%~~. Most common though would be a patron in a guild with the perk using her daily buff for +60% bonus.

Edit: /u/Seatin has told me that they do not stack. Seatin also mentioned that you can make even more by running around Mathosia while mentored down to get infinity stones from those zone events. 

I would say that you can expect anywhere from 3000 to 10000+ infinity stones a day depending on your bonuses and how much extra stuff you can do.",Leveling/Questing,False,self,t5_2s4an,1376418779.0,riftleveling,,True,t3_1k9pz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1k9pz7/infinity_stone_todo_list_with_bonuses/,

2. How hard is it to find a good raiding guild ?
3. Are the quests fun? Is levelling a grind like it was in vanilla WoW , or fun and scripted like in Cata ?

Can't reply after a month apparently, so here is a new thread!

Reply in the format:

**Faction - Server - Type**

*(Defiant - Sunrest PvP-RP)*

---

**Updating:**

If you want to change your faction/server tag or remove it post something like ""Updating my server to Sunrest PvP"", ""Updating my my faction to Defiant"", or ""Please remove my tags"". Remember to do it in a new comment so I get the orangered reminder.

---

**Copying our CSS:**

If you want to apply our custom CSS (Including the faction/server tags) to your subreddit or look at how we did something, here is the link: [r/Rift CSS](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/stylesheet.css?v=d9064bfa0819ce59a558d07c32e3ed25)

If you just want the faction/server tags, you should be able to just copy/paste everything after the 

    /* ~ Faction / Server Tags ~ */

comment. If not, just upload the factions image to your subreddit and link to your own copy.

**[Old Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/f19as/faction_server_labels/):**

For anyone interested, the old thread had 40 Guardians and 80 Defiants.

---

**Feb 23rd:** I think reddit may have done some kind of rollback on subreddit customizations or something, as a lot of stuff has reverted back to the way it was yesterday morning, I'll get it fixed asap! (I need to redo everyones tags since yesterday :P)

**README:**

**I wont be doing tags during the head start period as I'll be playing pretty much non-stop, but I'll get around to them if there is downtime or when I hit cap.** :P

---

**April 06th:** Sorry about the absolute complete lack of tagging for the past month (It's seriously been a month already?). As you  can probably understand, Rift is like a black hole that sucks in all of the spare time in my life. Between the 20 daily quests per day, grinding prestige, raiding greenscale and rift raids, and just trying to get a daily dungeon done now and again (I have 8 of them saved up right now), I haven't been able to find the time to really do anything! I think we're going to be looking for someone to help out with tags very soon though. 

Off to do my Dragonslayer Dailies and try and grind out todays 16 drakefoot for my apothecary quest!



---

---

**How To:**

The custom tags are all done through the custom style sheets that sub-reddits can use, found in Community Settings -&gt; Look and Feel -&gt; ""Edit Custom Stylesheet"".
If you use the Chrome browser you can right-click someones username and hit Inspect Element to get their ID, for example, my ID is **id-t2_49de1**. You can then add this ID into the appropriate section in the stylesheet to add their tags. Only people that allow CSS on sub-reddits will be able to see these tags.

If we were adding me as a Guardian right now, we'd put a comma (,) at the end of the last User ID in the Guardian section then add my id at the end like this:

    .lastuserid:before, .lastuserid:before, .lastuserid:before, .id-t2_49de1:before {
      content:"""";background-position:-20px 0;
    }

Since the faction tag is at the start of the username, we use the :before attribute, server tags are after the username, so they use the :after attribute. If you need to add a new server to the list, you can just copy/paste one of the existing ones and remove all the old usernames.",,False,self,t5_2s4an,True,,defiant,True,t3_fqrik,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/fqrik/faction_server_tags/,moderator
1375833662.0,32,self.Rift,1jujo5,Update! Rift framerate and Lag issues fixed!,Sadtimesahead,40,8,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1jujo5/update_rift_framerate_and_lag_issues_fixed/,"Recently I made a post about Rift running like crap on my computer. I scoured the internet and and managed to fix all my issues and the game runs like a champ now. Thank you for the few people who pointed me in the right direction and with that I was able to solve my issues. For people who might be having the same issues I'll post what I did to fix it since allot of people are having the same problems.


Disable Desktop Composition and Aero 
Note: This tweak works to improve performance with every game and only works in Windows 7/Vista if the default Aero theme is active. 
If you open Windows task manager and navigate to the “processes” tab you will notice there is a process constantly running called “dwm.exe”, or more commonly known as the Desktop Window Manager. This process handles all visual styles and information for the Windows Vista and Windows 7 Aero theme including glass style menu bars and taskbar transparency. 


By default the Windows theme uses extra RAM to make all menu windows and taskbar styles look better. This option can be slimmed down, or turned off while using any game or program, which will in turn boost available system memory. 
In order to turn these features off you simply need to right click on the executable or shortcut in question, in this case the Rift desktop shortcut, and select “properties”. Next select the “compatibility” tab and add a check mark (by clicking inside) the following boxes: 


-Disable Visual Themes 


-Disable Desktop Composition 


After selecting both boxes make sure to hit the “apply” button to save your changes. You will notice that whenever Rift is now started the bottom taskbar will lose transparency and look less “attractive”. Of course after the game is closed the visual style of the taskbar and all menu bars will return to normal. 


By default my “dwm.exe” process uses 40,888K or 40MB of system RAM while running normally, but after this tweak is enabled the Desktop Window Manager process slims to a total 2,944K or 2MB resource use. While this may not seem like a lot, it stands to reason that every bit of free memory helps system performance- especially in builds that have less total RAM installed. 


This will not harm your system in any way and can actually be disabled at any time by working backwards (unchecking the same boxes in the executable properties). 


Tweak Particle Settings


You can easily tweak the cut-off values for the game’s various particle effects by modifying the game’s configuration file. Simply update the values below in your Rift.cfg file, located in your game’s installation directory. Note that for most people ""VfxCullDistance = 256"" will need to be added under the Video section of the Rift.cfg file.


VfxCullDistance = 256
VFXLimit = 7500
LightingComplexity = 10.000000


Enable ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" (NVIDIA Only)
NVIDIA cards have a dynamic downclocking core so it uses less electricity and causes less heat. Occasionally in games your GPU may get ""stuck"" at a lower clock speed than what it should be at thus resulting in bad performance. By turning on ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" your GPU will more easily use more power to run at the speed it is supposed to with very little demand on the GPU. So in essence you should not see random downclocking with your GPU while playing games.


Here's how to do it:
Right click on your desktop and click ""NVIDIA Control Panel""
Click on ""Manage 3D settings"" on the left hand side of the page
Under ""Global Settings"" tab look for ""Power Management Mode"".
Most likely it will be set to ""Adaptive"" click that and change it to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"".


Run RIFT in DirectX9 mode
Depending on the age of your video card you could gain some performance by running Rift in DirectX9 mode instead of the built in DirectX11 mode it is set to run at. *NOTE* Running in DirectX9 mode will cause a little drop in graphics quality *NOTE*


In order to set Rift to run in DX9 mode do the following:
Right Click on your Rift shortcut
Add -dx9 at the end of the filepath
It should look something like: ""C:\Games\Rift\riftpatchlive.exe"" -dx9


For people with an AMD CPU, some of them have a feature called, ""Cool'n'quiet"" disable it in the bios. It was almost night and day the performance spike it gave me. If you don't know what it is here you go. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool'n'Quiet.


I've compiled this from a few different sources on the web, if you guys wants sources let me know and I'll hook  you up. I thought that maybe I could help someone out and spare them the tedium of searching through forums and walls of text. Have a wonderful day everyone. Here is a post I found that has most of this stuff on it as well above is what I did.

That is the main thing you need to have. All the bosses in Greenscale have various and intriguing mechanics, and none, I mean NONE act like the Boss dummy, and just stand there waiting to get hit. I am sick of people showing off parsers of their +1k dps on Boss dummies when it is irrelevant when you are dodging bombs or running to burn adds down.

What you need to have mastered:
Single Target DPS Vs AOE DPS - Certain bosses in Greenscale have more adds in them then others. You may be asked to switch from a boss nuking roll to an AOE roll to help out the off tanks. I suggest rogues have a specific single target DPS role (melee or ranged) and have a ranged AOE roll as well (31 ranger hybrid of some sorts.) Mages should come prepared with a Stormcaller build and be proficient with it along with their normal single target DPS role.

DPS vs Support - You may be asked to play an off role. Rogues should ALWAYS have a full 51 point Bard spec and/or Tank spec on hand, mages should have an Archon or Cholromancer spec ready. Some bosses only require X amount of healers, so Clerics should be prepared with a kickass DPS spec and Warriors should have both a Tank set and DPS set.

Raid Awareness - All the bosses in Greenscale have One-Shot moves besides their enrage timers (except Duke, but it doesn't take much for him to wipe the raid in a few hits.) So being aware and alert to the boss's mechanics and what is going on around you is clutch. Learn the fights and watch the videos before you even think about making a raid, your raid leaders should never have to explain in detail the fight mechanics.

Don't pad the meters. It doesn't matter if you are pulling 1200DPS on Hylas if the raid keeps wiping. Be prepared to sacrifice DPS for group utility.

Let me start off by saying, I have played almost every MMORPG out there to some extent. You name it, I at least have a character created. I've even tried subbing to WoW several times, even buying all of the expansions when they went on sale.
I have NEVER had an MMO pull me in like Rift has. It's just a quality game and that's all there is to it. I played Aion at release and even after it went F2P and it couldnt match up to the level of polish i feel in Rift. I've played WoW, but I always felt obliged to play because I was paying, and with Rift, I don't feel the ""payment pressure"".

With Rift it's different, there's quality, there's so much to do even at low levels. I'm currently level 25, and excited to see how big the world is. Just seeing how the game has set off since it's migration to F2P, I can only see the game getting better from here. 

I have a few things I would change, one being the gear is a little bland, coming from a game like WoW. The other being that to sell on the AH you must buy their in game currency, which in all honesty isn't a lot to ask of a quality game. 

Rift has really won me over, I can't wait to play every day when I get off work, and leveling is enjoyable and sociable.

If you're an MMO lover and you're on the fence about this game, please give it a try, you really won't regret it!

To conclude, here's a picture of my Archer, Adaerger, add me on Shatterbone! I'm always on!

http://i.imgur.com/J41DW3d.jpg

EDIT: I appreciate all of the feedback! I agree with a lot of the points and it seems the consensus is the game needs to be optimized a bit, and needs a more intuitive combat system that feels less sluggish. Otherwise, great game!

I just came back for the free week and it's amazing to me how well Rift encourages _casual_ grouping, from 1 to 50. Rift executes all the requisite theme park MMO features well, but in casual grouping it's so far ahead the rest of the field it's actually sort of astounding. The difference truly feels almost like the WoW revolution in MMO design. 

As you level, you don't just group in dungeons (though the dungeons are there, of course). The PG feature and smart non-parasitic quest design means you're always happy to see someone quest in the same area as you. And of course, the Rifts and events subtly nudge you towards grouping.

At level cap, most MMOs give you instances and raids, which is a semi-core to hard-core activity. Rift has those, of course (and lots of them). Before I quit the game I was in a hardcore raiding guild so I didn't completely realize how much Trion accomplished on the casual grouping side. 

In other MMOs there's basically zero reason to group for casual content. When I logged into my 50 this weekend, guildless and friendless, I figured I putz around solo and bit and do some dailies, maybe experiment with the balance changes a bit.

Nope. Within 15 minutes I was doing a rift raid daily (new to me). And it actually dropped barter items I needed! Then after that I got roped into a crafting rift group (new to me), and we steamrolled those for a while, netting me tons of great mats. 

It's actually such a simple design, when you think about it. Other MMOs may have some casual group content, but the rewards compete with the ""hardcore"" group content so it never gets any traction. Who runs normal mode dungeons when heroic mode dungeons give strictly better loot? Rift has _lots_ of casual group content, and sidesteps the incentive problem because the rewards for casual groups are in different slots than the hardcore group content. So all play styles participate. AND, the rewards are typically non-parasitic (more people = more eternal planar dusts per crafting lure).

Our one and only real chance of having a solid reddit startup on rift is coming up, [much like the ones we had on WoW](http://reddit.com/r/redditguild). Let's not pass this by!

We'll need a Guardian guild and a Defiant guild as likely we won't have consensus on that matter. 

We absolutely should host both guilds on the same server. A quick Google search brings up that there will be new server names on launch which means there'll be a small coordination hiccup until those names are released.

As for server-type: given the nature of the game I would recommend a PvP typeset. Possibly a RP-PvP typset to accommodate players of all types.

As we wait for those server names to be released, post your thoughts here or lurk on the IRC channel: irc.riftirc.com #rift

**EDIT**: Naming should probably be dead simple e.g. &lt;Reddit Guardians&gt; and &lt;Reddit Defiants&gt; (since we cannot both be &lt;reddit&gt; on the same server!)

**EDIT2**: [kuzc00 points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/fpr2p/we_have_three_days_to_figure_out_our_reddit_guild/c1hqb1g) that referencing reddit in a guildname might not fly on RP-PVP servers. I'll do my best to confirm whether or not this is okay before launch. **Update**: Some initial feedback from the official Rift forums says that Reddit in the guild name won't be a problem on an RP-PVP server.

I have also gone ahead and created [/r/redditdefiants](http://reddit.com/r/redditdefiants) for discussion on our defiant faction, as that's where I will be playing/setting up our defiant guild on launch.

SPOILS OF WAR - PRELUDE

* The Planes of Earth and Fire are suddenly showing an increase in activity, expanding their reach into zones previously left to other planar forces. Their Rifts and Invasions grow more numerous - but why?

* Look for new daily quests to appear in the cities of Sanctum and Meridian. Investigate the recent appearance of shells belonging to ancient golden dragon eggs, and mysterious coins showing up in Guardian and Defiant economies alike.

* Special reward packs for completing these new quests offer chances for uncommonly seen artifacts, rare and useful crafting materials, platinum and more. Reward packs also have a chance at containing a limited-time companion pet!


GENERAL

* Warfront-related guild quests now only progress on their proper maps.

* Multiple other quests requiring wins in Warfronts were fixed as well.

* Abandoning any variant of the Tools of Destruction quest will no longer remove Shadetouched Scepters, Blades, or Executors from your inventory. Additionally, Shadetouched Caches are no longer unique, so more than one can be held in your inventory at a time.

* Fixed a problem where some characters were not getting locked to the River of Souls raid properly.

* Shimmersand: Permanent Slumber: Fixed an issue that would sometimes prevent this quest from resetting 
correctly.

* Auto-AFK detection is now a bit less aggressive, so you won't get flagged AFK just for stepping away briefly.

Well I noticed that it in fact didn't and I was charged for 30 days, I contacted support just now and was told that the game time was actually only for new players, but because I had spent the extra $10 they said they will give me 30 days free anyway.

**Link to the spec:**
http://rift.magelo.com/en/soultree#l8g/DkGBiBhlkl8/n8

**Video Guide:**
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLLyPNJguQI

**Buffs:**

* Armor of Devotion
* Fury of the Fae
* Vegence of the Winter Storm
* Subtlety
* Aid of the Forest

**Macro's:**

**Single Target:**


 #show Fervent Strike

suppressmacrofailures

cast [notactive] Spirit of Asphodel

cast Fae Mimicry

cast Essence Strike

cast Combined Effort

cast Resounding Blow

cast Massive Blow

cast Fervent Strike

cast Trickster's Bolt

**AOE:**


 #show Wild Strike

suppressmacrofailures

cast [notactive] Spirit of Upheaval

cast Wild Strike

**Pets:**

* Single target DPS: Satyr Destroyer
* AOE: Greater Faerie Seer WITH toggled ability fae dispersion on
* Soloing: Greater Satyr Protector

**Single Target Rotation:**
Eruption of Life -&gt; Crushing Force -&gt; Spam Macro x4 -&gt; Vex -&gt; Then continue to spam your macro while reapplying both Crushing Force and Vex whenever they fall off.

Your eruption of of life will be continually refreshed by essence strike provided you stick to the same target

**AOE Rotation:**
Wild strike forever. However it can be an all around dps increase to use the ST macro 4 times when you have Fae Mimicry off cooldown, be sure to put this ability on a seperate bar and so that you watch this cooldown carefully.


**Utility:**

*Interrupts/Silences:*

* Notion Theft: Interrupt, 10 second CD, not on the GCD
* Grim Silence: Interrupts the target and silences it for 5 seconds, 30 second CD, on the GCD

*Movement:*

* Fae Step: Teleports to the Enemy and gives you a 50% speed increase for 5 seconds, 15 second CD, not on the GCD
* Ride the Lightning: Charges toward the Enemy, 15 second CD, on the GCD

*Other*

* Slumber, puts the target to sleep for 10 seconds, damage done will break this, 30 second CD, on the GCD


**Protips:**

* Druid is going to burn your mana like crazy, be sure to stock up and always carry lots mana pots to avoid having to constantly waste GCD's to sacrifice health for mana.
* You can take Spirit of Unheavel and Spirit of Asphodel out of your macro's and manually toggle them which in certain scenario's can lead to a possible dps increase.


It is as easy as that!

You can now have it removed.,ellori,35,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1fdv9k/got_scammed_by_ascendafriend_code_you_can_now/,"As a noob, I had put in a code 2 weeks back that someone assured me was a free Rift + SL + 30 day code, and of course, turned out to not be that but was instead his Ascend-A-Friend code.  So not only did I not have it, I couldn't even Ascend-A-Friend link with my real friend (who was also a noob, hence the belated attempt at linking).  And to top it off, I had the scammer's characters on my friend list.  Yuck.

Trion initially said they unfortunately didn't have the tools to remove AAF links, but just a couple days ago sent me an email saying:

&gt;I apologize for any frustration this issue may have caused. After further review, I'm happy to inform you that since the last response was sent our tools have been upgraded to allow us to remove Ascend-a-Friend referrals! That being said, I was able to remove that pesky unintended referral so that you may link your account with your correct friend.

So if you also unwittingly used someone's AAF code on your account, you can now request Trion to remove it.

No actually this is a little more serious.

Hey Reddit RIFT community,

First and foremost, let me say that I don't play WoW, actually I haven't played in over three years, so I am by no means a WoW fan boy. I actually play Rift and really enjoy it. (Lvl  Warrior Pally/Reaver)


That being said I find the WoW bashing reflects poorly on the Rift/Reddit community and it makes us look immature and incapable of being rational human beings (or a rational HiveMind?). Be doing this it will also help strength our community and make us less off putting to the curious WoW players out there. As such I would like to request that the gross WoW bashing, other MMORPG for that matter, be discouraged in submissions (Depending on context comments could go either way so use your up or down votes as you see fit). **Objective or factual comparisons are find and helpful,** but the constant 
&gt;""People who play WoW are stupid"" or ""Blizzard doesn't know what they are doing, that is why I play Rift""  


really should stop.     

Yes is the power player in the genre, Yes it is similar to Rift, but what we need to do is build a community that is not foundered on the bashing of another game just because it is the ""standard"". 

Of Course, I am by no means trying to say that we can't DISCUSS WoW but please just keep it civil.   

Finally I just wanted to say that I know I have not been very active in this subreddit, but I know I have seen a number of users welcoming ex and current WoW players with open arms and helping explain the difference between the two and for that I say **THANKS!** Keep it up.
    

Thoughts? Expansions on this? Suggestions. Comment below. 

**tl;dr**: Not a Wow fan boy, but the WoW bashing is not necessary and only hurts us as a community as it make us sound elitist. Help build a welcoming RIFT community by discouraging this behavior here, in game and in other Rift communities.

I started playing way back at Launch, got in the Beta and ended up buying the CE. By level 20 I had quit, the questing zones were too full, finding a dungeon was a hassle, and BGs were just a cluster fuck in general. All of this lead me to take a leave of the game (quitting I thought) things were broken, and I had sat through too many game launches to really have patience, I just wanted to grind grind grind.

Now, at heart I am a WoW player, it is what it is, it was my first major MMO (played UO but on player run shards) and have been subbed since launch, whether im playing or not.

Fast forward to now, I have been on a bender so to speak, everything has been boring me, no matter what game I have been playing, wow, swtor, me3, just anything really. I was browsing /r/rift for some random reason since it's one of my subbed reddits and said fuck it, and started playing again.

Let me start by saying dam there is alot of new content now, I have been pvping / rifting / dungeoning like crazy the passed couple of days and have been having a blast, this is definitely a game that gets dev love. I logged back into WoW for 30min to do my LFR for the week and couldn't even get that done, I wanted to play Rift.

So this really isnt anything more than a circle jerk post praising Rift, but I just felt it was needed. If more people are on the fence about coming back and giving it another shot, I would definitely say its worth the 15$ I am not gonna sit here and say i'm not playing wow again because that would be crazy, i've just invested too much time, but this is a game I am definitely happy to keep a dual subscription going for.

As you may or not know both credits and loyalty are shared between the EU/NA servers for an individual account. However the ability to claim both daily/weekly patron gifts is not, so you can log on the NA shards, claim your patron gifts and then log onto the EU shards and claim them again or visa versa! This can be done by on the initial log in screen on RIFT going to settings and changing the region.

I know a few of you are probably shouting 'EXPLOIT', But I had a chat with the Big- D man himself and he has decided to leave it in, just to see how this small amount of bonus credits will affect spending patterns.

So when I got the game I had made the decision to be Defiant (bear in mind that I thought this was a big decision because it was a big deal in WoW... well to me it was) I made a Bahmi warrior and I began my journey

So skip ahead about a week or so and i'm in Scarlet Gorge and my friends who had also bought Rift are now a little bit ahead of me. So hopefully everyone knows about the fire rift that almost constantly appears in the camp in Scarlet Gorge, where those demons are enslaving humans to work for them.

Well I grabbed my daily for it and saw that it was giving an award to destroy the Rift, so I posted in general chat to see if anyone wanted to tag along and take it on with me. I got no replies until another Bahmi warrior had brought up the offer to help me.

So the next thing I know im in the rift and we are completely surrounded by monsters everywhere. The Bahmi (who happened to be a tank) was taking on about 3-4 guys while me and my pet were helping out as best as we could. We were getting absolutely swarmed by people and we had just finished wave 1 (already I was tired from all the fighting). So as wave 2 approached we kind of strayed off behind a rock and thought of a game-plan. He charged an elite demon that was amongst the crowd and I followed in after him. 

He was getting hit pretty hard and was about the die, when all of a sudden we saw four Guardian players come out from no where and began blasting the guy with spells until he died. One of them said ""We're not gonna let you guys die."" 

At this moment I was inspired, they helped us take out the entire rift and then some after just doing a little clean up. I just remembered if I was ever surrounded by monsters on almost no health in WoW and saw an opposite fractioned player, they would never help me. I do understand that the Guardians did get something out of helping me, but what I wanted to bring up, is that this game is much different from WoW, because all of the veterans that are transferring over seem to be so much nicer and the general community is much more respectable. 

I respect Trion so much for making such an amazing game, and thank them. Hopefully they can get a lot more support from the community and we can show more people this wonderful game!

1376578916.0,23,self.Rift,1kf6t5,Tanking clinic for SL dungeons!,Ele5ion,24,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1kf6t5/tanking_clinic_for_sl_dungeons/,"This thread is mainly going to be addressed to newer players and or veteran players returning to the game that have not experienced tanking in Storm Legion content yet.

Couple things I want to address before I move into the content is that these items I am establishing are simply guidelines. They are by no means mandatory, so follow the advice if you are primarily relying on LFG to queue for dungeons.

One of the biggest differences between SL dungeons and old world dungeons in the current format is that almost every dungeon in SL has some kind of soft wipe mechanic.  What this means is if you don't move/hid or interrupt when you need to, people will die.  Also, there are some hard gear checks on the tank- aka if you dont have a certain amount of HP and mitigation you will get 2 shot.

First off, I won't sugar coat it- Tanking gear is hard to get.  Really while you are leveling up post 50 the only tank gear you will come across are:

**#1 crafted blues, which are generally more pricey on the AH because often the recipes are also a rare drop.**

**#2 Farming empyreal sourcestones from carnages to buy tanking greens from the adventure vendor in Tempest Bay.**

**#3 Dungeon drops (catch 22) since you need to be geared in the first place to farm for the drop.**

There are some world rare drops that have tanking stats, now and then you will find it on the AH for quite a hefty price.

You may be wondering why they designed it this difficult for tanking gear in the first place. Well, TRION realized that without soft enrage timers in dungeons that players can just cheese content by running a heavy healing setup to trivialize encounters- so their solution to this problem was to make it a hard gear check on tanks.  If the tank dies cause he/she cant take more than 2 hits then most likely the party will wipe.

**DEFILER soul from cleric/NECROMANCER soul from MAGE is an exception to this rule since they can provide a 30% damage reduction from links!**

So let me get to the point, baseline HP requirements for tanking:

**Exodus of the Storm Queen -15K**

**Storm Breaker Protocol - 20K**

**Unhollowed Boneforge - 25K**

**Golem Foundry - 30K**

**Archive of Flesh - 30K**

**Empyrean Core - 35K**

**Tower of the Shattered -35K**


**You can deviate from this by about 2K HP depending on how geared your healer is and if you are running support**

So as you can see, the HP requirments jump about 5k each Instance per level with the exception of Foundry/Archive which are stable at 30k.

you will not be able to get these HP numbers without runing your gear!

**Gleaming Adamant Rune, Gleaming Resolute Rune are what you need!** these are green runes you may use on any lvl 51+ gear for their appropriate slot and they provide a hefty +21 endurance and are extremely cheap on the AH and will allow you to hit these baselines. **Also, Blazing Tough Runes from old world are good for pants and shoulders**

On the bright side, not every slot in your equiment has to be tank gear, you may have up arround 4 slots that can be DPS.  For example, your rings and your neck peice, sometimes your ranged slot is hard to fill with a tanking item if it does not drop.  On these occasions fill it with the highest level DPS item you have, **Endurance&gt;ALL** stat wise if your not running a tanking item.

Now that we have talked about gear, lets go over preventing damage.
This is going to be very general as this is not a guide for specific tank classes. If you have questions regarding specific tank classes feel free to ask, I have experience in ALL WAR tank specs, cleric tank, and rogue tank so can address anything specific that you want to know.  

But you want to make sure you have your basic damage mitigation abilities on cool down and always up.  Your big ""oh crap"" shields and self heals you want to save during phases where the healer needs time to catch-up and you anticipate a big hit.  Remember, keeping yourself alive is just as much your responsibility as well as the healers.

Remember, as the tank you still have the need to move out of bad stuff, stack when needed, and interrupt most of all.  Also, if you are getting low on health and out of cool downs to use, kite the boss if the healer is behind!  Sometimes delaying one or two auto attacks from the boss can make the difference between life and death.

I hope this helps those who are tank aspirant seeking to do good in their roles!  Tanks are lacking in queue and hopefully this will go someways in assisting those interested!

Once again, if you have any questions about any specific encounters, normal or expert- or tanking/spec questions, feel free to post and ask.

**EDIT: Hey guys/gals! I'm thinking of doing another clinic similar to this one except for maybe alittle more detail with some more specifics.  What are you interested in?

If you ever thought the quests we had in Phase 1 were bad.  This will will make you cry with tears.  Or give up.

I decided to look at how to tweak the Addon TomTom [[via Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/rift/tomtom)] [[via RiftUI](http://www.riftui.com/downloads/info353-TomTom.html)].

In version 2.2, the author splitted out Summerfest into a separate file.  And it's nicely formatted and very easy to understand.

    \RIFT\Interface\Addons\TomTom\Tomtom_Summerfest.lua    

So what I decided to start doing is converting coordinates that I find on the forums and add them to this file.

            { xpos=13310, zpos= 6000, description=""unknown bottle"", },
        },
    },

Modify the file.  Go back to Rift and /reloadui

You can then use TomTom's radar to show tell you where to go to the next waypoint, without having to manually fiddle around with the map and alt-tabbing between Rift and forums etc.

Anyway, this made the Summerfest hunting A LOT more fun for me.  Hopefully this will be useful to people since we're on the last phase.  May be there are some of you that has given up but now may give it another chance.

I was hoping that some of the more experienced players could shed some in depth light on what I should be accomplishing daily in game now that I am 60.

Rep grinds - what ones?  For what items?

Raid rifts?

Are there daily raids/dungeons?  Where can these be picked up?

Random que for SL experts or classic experts?  Which one?

There was an issue with my credit card, it wouldn't go through. The support rep I spoke to was really nice and we figured it was probably some type of fraud protection on my credit card. No big deal, not my fault, not theirs.

I was ready to hang up and she said she was adding 30 days of game time to my account just for the trouble! I was obviously really happy about this, it's not often I have any good fortune like this.

If you are interested in playing with others in r/rift, have a look at out [Community Polls Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/f2gdj/community_polls_server_type_faction/) that we have linked in the side bar and vote on what you would like to do. So far we have a 50/50 split on faction choice, and the majority of people would want to play on a PvP server.

If you are interested in joining a Reddit guild at launch regardless of where it is, let people know in here so that we can get a good estimate of what you would want and begin to discuss guild leadership.

Keep in mind, I did not complain or even contact them to follow up. They took the initiative here.  I think I'll be buying some points even though there isn't anything in particular I want, but just because I want to support a company with service like this (bold added by me):

Greetings Ascended,

Thank you for contacting us in regards to your recent experiences in RIFT. We want to begin by apologizing for the long delay prior to replying to your request for support. We have been positively overwhelmed by the reaction to RIFT over the past two weeks. 

Due to this overwhelming response, and the number of support requests we have received as a result, we have been unable to provide each request the individual attention that we would like in a timely fashion. We have made a number of updates over the past week, and it is our sincere hope that your issue is no longer outstanding and has since been resolved. In the event that you may have lost or not received an item in-game we understand that often times a short time later you may have acquired that item or a better item in its place.

We at Trion are committed to providing you the best player experience and customer support available. With the goal of addressing each of you as quickly as possible, while also hoping to remove these requests which no longer require assistance we have placed your request into a “waiting status”. If you still require assistance with your original issue then please update that request within the next 72 hours with the statement “I still need assistance with my original request” and we will reply to your issue in the order in which it was initially received. 

Please also be aware that the answers to many commonly asked questions can be found at https://support.trionworlds.com/

**To aid us in compensating you for these actions we have applied 750 credits, and the associated loyalty, to your account.** 

Please accept our apologies and continue to enjoy your adventures throughout Telara. Thank you for your continued support of Trion Worlds and RIFT. If you have any additional questions or concerns then please don’t hesitate to let us know.

I have some professional expertise in the area, and so played around with a debugging tool for a while. I was able to find that the following are possible:

* teleport to any location (type /loc to see your location)
* increase runspeed
* ""swim in the air,"" ie fly
* hover / levitation
* noclip - pass through walls
* increase game loop speed - your client thinks everything happens faster

I'm not going to disclose how to do any of this, but I'm sure that if I can find this in an afternoon, so can many many people. Trion has to be aware of this - how game breaking can it be to teleport inside a warfront?

Be halfway to the corresponding NPC hub when the sky is rent apart by a dozen holes in the fabric of reality itself - rifts to the elemental plane of death.

2) Find yourselves trapped in a valley with armies of undead abominations pouring down upon you. Call upon the power of the Vigil to bolster your resolve and single-handedly butcher wave after wave until at last you and your friend are overwhelmed and killed. Watch in awe as a tide of planar beings washes over the valley and slaughters the friendly NPCs, establishing a massive foothold.

3) Respawn and try to retake a smaller outpost instead. Be attacked on the road by a pair of cowardly Defiant hoping for easy kills. Look on helplessly as your friend succumbs, then turn around and (using every ability at your disposal) manage to kill both of your assailants. Take a moment to recompose yourself.

4) Charge to the contested area where dozens of undead lie in wait. Expend a planar charge to shoot a flare into the sky, summoning reinforcements to your side. Wade into the pitched battle and watch the corrupted ground recede before your eyes as the last zombie is cut down.

5) Realize that all of this happened in the space of about fifteen minutes.

I know it wont realistically happen, but I know there are already some groups forming up.

Pros:

*friendly and not so friendly competition between Guardian and Defiant Reddit guilds.

*easier to advertise stuff for trade here on reddit

*form interguild raid groups for times when your regular group cant/doesnt run. 

*could arrange pvp battles between groups (not sure how possible it would be in warfrons with the current setup)

*other benefits I havnt thought of.

Cons:

*really doesnt offer that much use.

*too much to coordinate

*the arguements for this arnt really all that good

*this wouldn't last that long since as more people join the sub-reddit the will already be on another sever

*something else entirely

Clearly there would still have to be two servers PvE and PvP, so that might make this not work if the interest isnt strong enough. Just a thought I had while i avoided grading lab reports.

Thoughts?

**clarification edit**

I suppose there would be four servers: 

*North American PvP

*North American PvE

*EU PvP

*EU PvE

Also I did not mean to imply everyone should join the same guild, but rather and guild with a Reddit affiliation would roll on the same server.

Though the streaming community outside of Trion is rather dead. Every time I load up Twitch to look for a Rift stream there's max, about 100 people total watching streams.

Now you're asking, how does this affect new players, or people coming back? Well, watching streams is actually really helpful. You have immediate interaction between the broadcaster, who usually has great knowledge of the game and can explain to you easily, and you also have other viewers who are willing to help you learn. While watching and asking questions, you're also learning mechanics of whatever the streamer is doing. Things like Expert Dungeons or Raids, you watch and learn the fights, as well as other things.

I think there's an untapped resource the Rift Community isn't using, and is instead coming here to show off fancy pictures or ask general questions about coming into the game. 

Rift is a game that deserves more attention, and the community is bustling with new players and old alike with the recent F2P model. I feel as though this resource will truly help the Rift Community.

After I found [this thread's comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/uiglk/just_resubbed/), I thought Faeblight sounded like a pretty good choice.

I'm level 11 right now, and I'm really enjoying the rift hunting aspect, running around to the newest rift and wreaking havoc.  However, there were two problems: participation, and travel.

One of the first Rifts may have been a mandatory primary quest dealie, but there 3 other players with me.  Since then, I've done half a dozen other Rifts, but not a single player in sight, so I had to solo them.
Is this just because I'm in the very early levels?  Does this improve later on?  Are the Rifts worth visiting at the higher (or maxed) levels?

Secondly is travel.  I asked the /4 (Level 1-29) chat a simply innocuous question: 

*""Getting around is tough. At what level can I use a mount?""* 

I was met with some responses, but not answers.

*""You can mount at level 1.""*

Well, I'm wondering why I don't have one yet.

*""Well, when can I obtain the mount?""*

*""Level 1""*

It almost turned into an Abbott &amp; Costello skit before someone finally informed me:

*""You need 2p50g""*

I'm still really new to this game, and I've only earned 80 gold so far.

*""Is that 250 gold or 2500 gold""*

*""2p50g""*

Ugh. 

So I proceed with my questing, and I get some unexpected mail.
[Here's what was inside](http://i.imgur.com/EPVLn.png)
 
I was taken aback.  Such generosity to a complete stranger is pretty unheard of.
It was a good choice to play on Faeblight.  Thank you to Shala_____, who sent the very generous help.  This is the best thank you that I can compose right now, and I hope to return this favor in one way or another in the near future.

I'm enjoying this game a lot so far but there's this one little thing that people are saying on the forums as well as ingame and this bother me... A LOT.

Sure, this game looks a lot like WoW and Trion staff definitely don't try to hide it (even the game's slogan is a reference to that game!) but as far as game mechanics goes, this is a completely different game. This game isn't all about one guy taking all the damage, one guy healing the damage taker and everyone else maxing out their DPS but more a focus of everyone using all their abilities at their maximum potential to help the group as a whole to win whatever content they're trying to do, be it PVP or PVE. The main tank is getting whacked too hard? stun/squirrelize/kite one of the mobs away from him to give him a chance to recover. The main healer just got killed? hope that one of your teammates have a backup healing ability. A saboteur is stacking charges on an ally? remove the charges with a debuff.
With the Parser gaining more and more popularity i'm afraid this is just gonna end like WoW where players are only judged solely by the amount of DPS/HPS they can pull out and discredit those who sacrifice HPS/DPS for support abilities that make whatever content the group is trying to beat (such as interrupting spellcasting, removing enemy buffs, augmenting resistances, shielding key members, etc) much easier and the content getting run smoothier.

And please. Oh please I beg you, stop saying that Clerics MUST be healer and Warriors MUST be tanks, this is so wrong. Rogues can be offhealers or tanks, Mages can do a very potent healing job and Clerics can do a superb tanking job.

This is my opinion, feel free to agree or not.

1372182477.0,20,self.Rift,1h1tvd,How do I Queue as [Insert Role Here] ?,NotHomo,25,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1h1tvd/how_do_i_queue_as_insert_role_here/,"So I wasn't getting good information on how the queue system working so I did my own testing.

The system has a pretty rigid conclusion of which trees do what.  If you mouse-over the soul icon you will see the classification whether the tree is considered a soul for Healing, Offense (Damage), Defense (Tank), or Support.  Now it doesn't matter whether your support tree is giving you the ability to heal, or whether your tank tree is giving you damage increases, the only thing that matters is the base soul classification.

It boils down to this, the game needs you to spend MORE THAN 30% (exactly 30% won't count) into a tree classification in order to make you eligible to queue in the role associated.  A tricky part is that it does count SOME trees as hybrid, in the sense that points applied to that tree ALSO count as points in a different type.

For example the mage tree Chloromancer is labeled as a Healing soul.  However, putting points in that tree counts as both Healing points and Support points.  Archon is labeled as Offense, but putting enough points in it will unlock both the Damage and Support roles.

Now if you have 2 Defensive souls and you are splitting points in them, then both count towards the &gt; 30% needed to queue as a Tank.  The real confusing part is the Hybrid trees (and the trees that SHOULD be hybrid but aren't [i'm looking at you, bard])

It would be nice to have a list of what all the trees are ACTUALLY classified as.  The trouble is I believe the queue takes multiple roles into account when determining your elegibility, so it's a little difficult to specifically determine what trees are classified as unless you want to spend a lot of money resetting ALL your roles, or level lots of characters to 15 to test. So here's the ones I have tested and maybe we can crowdsource a full list.

[This knowledgebase article](https://support.trionworlds.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1597/kw/RIFT%20Account%20Types%20and%20Restrictions) lists in-game restrictions for different account types (guest, registered, registered w/ loyalty, and patron). You can get to 1500 loyalty by spending $5 on the lowest credit package in the Rift store. 

[This FAQ](http://www.riftgame.com/en/store/free-to-play/#faq) lists what exactly Patron status grants, what you get when buying the base game, and what you get for buying Storm Legion. Some further notes on that: 

* The base game can be had for $10 or less on various game key websites, or possibly less if you are lucky enough to find a box in-store since the original is so old now. 
* When buying Storm Legion, there are editions that include the base game as well. 'Combo Pack' and 'Infinity Edition' are the two types known to me that contain the base game. 
* Any edition you buy that includes extras in-game items still rewards those items. Includes Original game Digital Collector's Edition and Storm Legion: Infinity Edition, possibly others. 
* Storm Legion: Infinity Edition grants 60 days of Patron status according to my account page.
* You don't want to buy a Storm Legion key unless it can be had for less than $20 or so, which is about how much the Storm Legion souls cost through the RIFT store by buying with credits. The new souls are the *only* thing buying a Storm Legion key grants you (unless of course you are buying the Infinity Edition or a combo pack w/ the original game).",Info,False,self,t5_2s4an,1371754141.0,riftinfo,,True,t3_1gprab,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1gprab/explanation_of_freetoplay_account_types_patron/,

MY BUILDS:
In an expert dungeon, a mage will either be main damage, support, or heal as chloromancer.
My builds are centered around damage, fun, and survivability. Both of my PvE builds leave the third soul free of points so I can have squirrel when needed and switch to Archon on the fly for extra damage buffs when crowd control is unnecessary.

First off is my damage build (Necro/Lock/Dominator):
http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=1zwvs.xtczVdkds.cfRhkVqxk
I chose this build because it competes for the highest damage, has good AoE, and has lots of safety buttons. I put filler points into 2/3 Vengeful Spirit because there are a few situational boss fights where the Zealot dies too quickly.


My healing build (Chloro/Lock/Dominator):
http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=1zRvs.xdIuaVczoo.beohzVqxo
Unconventionally, I placed points into Call of Spring and and Circle of Life rather than Enduring Tether and Accelerated Growth. While Bloom and Flourish are not used that frequently, I find myself praying for a critical strike when I do use them. I think it is about preference and depends on your tank. I also grabbed Neddra’s Essence and Shadow Life because a dead healer does 100% less healing than living one. 


WARLOCK:
If paired with Necromancer, always use void bolt over plague bolt. With talents, Void Bolt will hit harder and cast faster. It hits hard enough that it is worth sacrificing the Deathly Calling stacks from Plague Bolt.

Maximizing DoT and AoE damage revolves around timing. DoT’s deal initial damage and tick every 2 seconds. If a DoT is recast immediately after a tick, it will also deal the initial damage of the recasted DoT simultaneously. This is most important for Devouring Shadows. For maximum warlock AoE damage, cast Neddra’s Touch and Dark Touch followed by Radiate Death (plague rot optional), and then cast Devouring Shadows. Immediately after the first tick (2 seconds from initial cast), recast a new Devouring Shadows. If done effectively, you will double the damage of your devouring shadows by having it tick twice every two seconds.

Opportunity - This ability does not increase damage or damage per second. While it is great in PvP and may increase spike damage shorty, all spells have a 1.5second global cooldown, which means that any instant cast spell is the equivalent of a 1.5second cast. No spell in the warlock or necromancer tree (other than plague bolt), is longer than a 1.5second cast.
In short, Opportunity will never increase damage per second unless paired with spells that are longer than a 1.5second cast time.

Lingering Pain - This ability is a huge damage increase. Instead of refreshing Life Leech by recasting it and dealing no damage, refresh it with Void Bolt and deal the damage of your main nuke.

Neddra’s Torture - Effect works on pre-existing DoT’s on the target. It does not have to be cast prior to DoT’s.

Draining Bolt deals more damage than Void Bolt and can be cast while moving. It’s worth getting - but not for the heal.

Neddra’s Grasp is not worth casting in most fights because enemies do not use abilities fast enough. It is only used in conjunction with Dark Touch and Radiate Death for AoE damage.

Shadow Life - Jargon aside, this mathematically heals for 75% of your current life.

Radiate Death - This can be used as a quick way to refresh both Neddra’s Touch and Dark Touch by casting only one spell. It can be used on bosses if the boss is spawning additional enemies.

Both Dark Power and Improved Warlock Armor count as 10% flat damage increases.


NECROMANCER:
Symbiote is worthless. It causes your pet to heal you for an extra ~35 health per hit when Essence Link is active. It does not affect the heal reduction on Essence Link.

Soul Purge has a higher Damage per second than Void Bolt, costs no mana, can be cancelled without loss of damage, heals you and your pet, and I believe counts as a DoT for Neddra’s Influence talent damage buff. Use it!

Skeletal Zealot is the highest damage pet. Unless the boss is going to kill it with aoe, use it over the Shadow Revenant.

You can name your pets by clicking their names in the portrait.

Necrosis greatly affects pet damage. Keep it up at all times. Use Looming Demise in conjunction with normal rotation on bosses.

CHLOROMANCER:
The highest healing rotation is to cast Nature’s touch, then follow up with Vile spores and a 1.5second cast or instant cast life ability, and repeat. A rotation should look something like this:
Natures Touch → Vile Spores + Ruin
Natures Touch → Vile Spores + Radiant Spores
Natures Touch --&gt; Vile spores + Withering Vines
If you always cast Radiant Spores after Ruin, then you will know than after each Ruin, it is time to refresh Radiant Spores because of the 15second cooldown on Ruin and 15second duration on Radiant Spores.

If the tank needs an immediate heal and Nature’s Touch is almost done casting, follow it up with Bloom to keep the tank alive during the Nature’s Touch travel time.

Using Choke (warlock silence) on spellcaster enemies during a pull can be very helpful for your tank.

When casting Bloom and the mana bar drops by about 10%, it is because of Natural Awareness and will go back up in 6 seconds. Bloom only costs ~69mana. 

Always buff Lifegiving Veil as your last buff. Dispels work on a “first on, first off” basis, so this way you don’t have Lifegiving Veil dispelled off so easily. On a related note, always dispel a chloromancer in pvp, because unless they have read this, Lifegiving Veil will usually come off first. I recommend recasting it in PvP once you have allies buffs on you so it is less likely to be purged.

Natural Conversion does not take away the damage of the spell being cast but heals it up afterwards.

Destructive Growth is useless. It is a small area 10% damage boost for 12 seconds every two minutes on a spell dependent on charge. Use the spell more strategically for it’s heal and place the two talent points elsewhere.
Unless in a raid environment (and even then), Empathic Bond is also useless. If Chloro is paired with warlock or archon, then mana is abundant.

Sacrifice Life: Damage triggers Circle of Life’s effect (Increased critical strike chance of Bloom and Flourish).

Call of Spring affects all heals, but there is a discrepancy on whether or not it affects Lifegiving Veil heals. In addition, it does affect heals from trinkets and greater planar essences.

Lifegiving Veil does proc greater essences and trinkets that heal over time or shield allies. The epic quality essences paired with superior (blue) quality essences stack, but two of the same quality will not go into the same sigil.

If you are afflicted by a reduced cast time debuff (rogues, dominators), then bloom and flourish will no longer be considered instant cast despite points in Healing Slipstream.

Many people do not pick up Essence Surge despite getting 32 points in Chloromancer, but I see no other place where that one point would be better spent.

If Stream of Reclamation or Corrosion are cast while Entropic Veil is active, the entire spell will receive the benefit of Entropic Veil even if the damage buff fades due to running out of energy. Spells that are castable like Nature’s Touch will not receive benefit of Entropic Veil unless they finish casting while Entropic Veil is still active.

Almost every other boss in an instance debuffs the tank with a dispellable DoT. Work it into your rotation after a Nature’s Touch cast and greatly reduce healing required. Note: some bosses cast more than one debuff. Find out which is dispellable and watch several impossible bosses become farmable.

I crafted what items I can that I knew would be worth it. 


I ran around closing rifts to pick up some new lesser planar essences that I still needed to update from lvl 50. 


I know there must be gear to get with Infinity Stones. I am picking them up all over the place with the daily quests I run into in the lvl 60 zones. I haven't figured out where to spend them yet. Any idea where these can be spent and for what? 


Any others that I missed?

*So we all know by now Rift went free to play. With it came the ushering in of the games Rex Store. Rex Exchange better known as Rex to the community. REX is an item that can be purchased with real money, which can be traded and sold in-game amongst players, and can be exchanged for Credits and Loyalty.

*Credits are what the store actually uses as currency. Rex which you can buy turns into 1250 credits. Credits you can buy directly if you wish but can't be traded like Rex can in the auction house. So say if you want the entry level cheapest credits 5 dollars will get you 750 credits.If you would like to go for a bit more the next level is 20 dollars for 3250. 

*The prices for the items in the store seem right on point. A few things make you say dafuq why is this that expensive? But in all a good job was done on pricing. Now at first glance looking at everything with a wide eye. I was like wow they put every damn thing into the store. And I was like mg! When I see an item say ""Chance at relic"" I'll address that right now.

*The one and only thing I don't like in this store. Is the fact you can even have a chance at a relic. Some things should be sacred in games. Legendaries even at chance should never be purchased in my opinion. You take the luster and achievement off of them by doing that. Granted the relics suck I think they shouldn't even be called that. It's just my opinion however. And I know it's just a business move to generate sales.

*That aside this is the most in depth, and well-made cash shop I've ever seen in a F2P. Worlds better than the non-sense Guild Wars 2 has. And even shares shades of what I have been begging Anet to do for a while. Case in point I'm all about style and customization.

*The sheer number of armors and looks at your fingertips is a nice touch. Makes it close to impossible beyond you're one lazy sob. To never look just like the next person standing next to you. Close to 200+ armor sets you can buy via the Rex/Credit system. Means Rift probably has the most deep armor customization on the market.

*Trade Skills on the store pretty much almost every mat is up there. Doesn't mean you should go crazy it's still better for you to farm it. But just in case you're struggling to farm a certain thing. Or just don't want to run all over the zone for one item. You can use this as a quick fix.

*As far as the mounts pets and Dimensions. You can preview everything so you will never have a noob purchase. The preview everything was big for me because you couldn't always do that before. In all I think this store was extremely well made and should do well for the game. Let it out what you think. Also let Trion know if you found any imbalances or bugs.

However, I don't think that Rift has the player numbers it deserves. So, I thought it would be cool if as a subreddit, we put together a little campaign for /r/gaming (and related subs) to try and get a few more players. 

I have a few ideas of what we could advertise. I think it's really important to let people know that the PvE endgame in this game is really solid, and not like WoW's easy, medium, hard mode of the same raid in both 10 and 25man. 

I really think that some people are looking (as I was) for a game to play PvE endgame in (because of WoW burnout, and lack of endgame in other games, eg GW2), and that these people may have discounted Rift as an option.

If you are interested, I will be working towards founding a guild today after I roll a toon. Let me know in the comments in you are interested, and I will get you added to a friends list until the guild is founded. This isn't a guild recruitment advertisement, just a guy looking for some newbies to play and learn with.

Edit:
NA Server is Faeblight, IGN is Saitus and I am a defiant if that matters.

Edit 2: 
It seems like a lot of interested parties are on faeblight. I will be able to transfer there tonight and start looking you all up. Anyone have the scoop in the server? Population, community, etc?

Edit 3:
The guild has been formed! We are Nodgoers. Contact Saitus in game to join up. :)",Returning Player,False,self,t5_2s4an,1361248049.0,riftreturning,,True,t3_18p2jf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/18p2jf/a_call_to_new_players_or_those_considering_the/,

The invasions, the rifts, the class system, all these new features are so unique and so unlike anything i've ever played.

But that's not what I had to post about, because you all probably experienced this. What I had to come here and post about was the fact that I have never had a nicer day of player interaction on an online RPG since I used to play text-based MUDs. 

Is this just a lucky server pick thing? I'm on Guardians side Laethys. I emerged in to a world where people would ask ""noob"" questions and *get answers for them*. I was so enthralled with this that I even asked questions myself (and I definitely will pay it forward), something I had not done since, again, text-based MUDs because you normally get laughed at, called a ""fag"" or get no answer at all.

On the entire day, which I spent the entire day playing, I saw *one* person be rude, and it was to someone spamming non-stop about their guild, and after several times of asking nicely for them to go away.

And the invasions, oh god I love them, I can't recall the last time a system pulled people together like this instead of ripping them apart.

I know this is something that will probably deteriorate after time, once everyone knows so much about the game and starts expecting everyone else to know everything about the game a la WoW, but for now I am absolutely loving it. 

So, I guess what i'm asking is, what about you guys? Did you have this experience, or is it just a lucky day or lucky server pick?",,False,self,t5_2s4an,False,,,True,t3_igush,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/igush/had_my_first_day_on_rift_yesterday/,

Add to that the fact that most of the things can be purchases through ingame store and that Rex can be traded and it looks cool to me.

1370539096.0,17,self.Rift,1fsvsh,Some Experiences From a Returning RIFT Player,Riizu,20,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1fsvsh/some_experiences_from_a_returning_rift_player/,"Hey /r/Rift!

First off, thanks so much for the help I got in my first post here. Plenty of people were willing to offer resources and opinions for a returning player, and that was incredibly helpful.

I thought it'd be nice to return the favor and include some things I had learned since returning about two weeks ago. I'll keep it in simple bullet point format, and I'd be happy to add anything others have experienced.

* Souls - If your coming back, take a serious look at your soul trees. As a mage, Necromancer and Chloromancer are far from what they used to be at launch.

* Abilities - Trion has added a wonderful sorting system to abilities. When you open your spellbook (p) you'll see things like ""Charge Consumers"", ""Buffs"", ""Debuffs"" and more. Use this to help determine how spells are intended to function and synergize together.

* Leveling - Ultimately, leveling is no longer limited to a single activity. From what I could tell, any play-style choice was a valid option for leveling. Whether it be quests, grinding, PvP, Instant Adventures, or Crafting, explore all your options.

* End-game - Currently, I have just reached Storm Legion content, so I can't speak fully on this, but one thing I have noticed is that I don't feel in a rush to reach end-game. I'd like to be there, but questing has been incredibly fulfilling, and things like zone invasions are just as exciting as ever (case in point, a Stillmoor invasion that took close to an hour to complete and involved a giant robot, abombination-zombie, and lots of deaths).

* Cairns and Puzzles - In case you haven't heard of these, throughout the world are hidden puzzles and cairns, usually one per zone. The puzzles will each result in an achievement, rare-quality or higher piece of gear, experience, and usually a title. Cairns on the other hand are caches hidden around the world with gear. Once all have been found, you will also receive an achievement. Use these as ways to supplement your leveling gear, as well as break up your questing.

* Zone quests - For the most part, these are exactly as you would expect. Collect ten rat tails, or kill ten wolves. Occasionally, their will be something more elaborate, but keep an eye out for the story quests (characterized by a yellow background). I recently completed the Unseen questline, and it was incredibly rewarding watching a story unfold from level 10 to level 50. Also, Iron Pine Peaks presented a strong level of frustration for a completionist like myself. About 10 quests keep me from the finished achievement, and they seem to be impossible to find, or are designed to appear as you gain levels later on (I returned at 50 to find a couple that would prep the story for Storm Legion).

* Zone Progression - For those who are unaware, you can level in this path Defiant side: Freemarch -&gt; Stonefield -&gt; Scarlet Gorge -&gt; Scarwood Reach. You can then choose to either head south and complete Droughtlands and Shimmersand, or head north and complete Moonshade Highlands -&gt; Iron Pine Peaks -&gt; Stillmoor. Guardians can replace Freemarch and Stonefield with Silverwood and Gloomwood.

* Mentor Levels - Mentoring is an excellent system for helping new players as well as completing under-level content while still receiving relevant experience. Right-click on your player portrait and select ""Set Mentor Level."" Zones are often gated though, so if you can't go higher than a certain level, that is why.

* Instant Adventures - Press (.) and you can queue up for instant adventures at any time. They will port you to the relevant location, and you can easily group up with new people, gain experience, and rewards.

* Channel 4, aka Level 1-29 - With the advent of F2P, and Raptr, 1-29 chat is INCREDIBLY full with new players, but it suffers from Barrens chat syndrome. I won't go into this too much, just know it isn't representative of the entire community, and can easily be removed (/leave 4). I started to see an improved experience immediately in Level 30-49, though the occasional troll would show up if people seemed to be having too good of a time.

* Random dungeons/Warfronts/Etc - RIFT does have a LFG system for finding groups for dungeons, warfronts, group quests, or instant adventures. The daily randoms for warfronts and dungeons should be of particular importance though, as you will receive a gear bag afterwards with vastly improved rewards.

* Storm Legion at 48 - Come level 48, you can begin leveling in Storm Legion. You will receive a notification mail as well. Also, if you choose to do the prequel quests (on defiant side, this is a crashed ship that you will receive a notice for as well) you can get storm legion costume gear and further breadcrumbs for storm legion.

As I have noticed in the last couple of days there has been some confusion as to how chloro should be played. Well, I decided to chime in with a guide of my own, I hope you find it useful!(Please say if you can see any room for improvement)  

**ST Healing**  
*The Spec* - [link](http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=1zsRq.McV.EdIuqAIkRR.V)  

*The Rotation*  
Your Basic rotation goes like this:  
Radiant Spores(Only if this is not already on the boss, do not macro)-&gt;Withering Vines(Depends on number of melee as to how effective it will be, more useful in 20mans. Only if it is not already on the boss)-&gt;Nature's Touch-&gt;Void Life(twice and cancel the second one midcast as Nature's Touch will come up mid channel)

*The Macros*  
There are a variety of useful macro's for MT healing as chloro, some are situational. I can't type the #show command with the weird reddit formatting so just add one at the front of each macro. Most of these probably won't be copy pastable, reddit formatting is weird.

Oh shit macro:  
suppresmacrofailures  
cast [shift Essence Surge  
cast Bloom  
cast Flourish(situational, you may want to remove for high AoE damage fights)  
cast Essence Surge  

Cleanse macro:  
suppressmacrofailures  
stopcasting(stops any currently channeled abilities)  
cast @mouseover Nature's Cleansing.

*Other Info*  
Use Wild Growth on CD whenever you can be in melee range, 10% increased dmg is a lot. Pop it at the same time the bard pop VoJ at the start of a fight.  
Don't be afraid to hit Bloom, it has a very short CD and is very strong.  
The Buffs you want to use will be Living Energy(Unless your guild wants to use the bard buff) and synth on the MT, if there is tank swapping, then you need to be synth swapping. Casting synth will buff you with LBV.  
Natural Splendor is an amazing healing CD, save it for when you know you will get full use out of it(won't have to move, tank isn't already at full health).  
Use (in this order) Emphatic Bond-&gt;Living Shell(unless there is AoE dmg)-&gt;Mana Wrench to regain mana.  
Keybind everything. I can't think of anything else for this section, feel free to help out!

*The Rotation*  
Starts the same as your ST healing rotation:  
Radiant Spores(Only if this is not already on the boss, do not macro)-&gt;Withering Vines(Depends on number of melee as to how effective it will be, more useful in 20mans. Only if it is not already on the boss)-&gt;Wild Growth(If you are in melee range only)-&gt;Ruin-&gt;Vile Spores  

*The Macros*  
Mostly the same macros as the ST healing spec. Only extra macro is:  
Spam Macro(hit shift, unless you use it for keybinds, and you will cast Radiant Spores, Radiant Spores will also only cast if you are moving):  
suppressmacrofailures  
cast [shift Radiant Spores

*Other Notes*  
Same rules apply as with ST healing as chloro. Use Sac:Life Mana if you are running low.  
At the start of a pull cast your archon buffs to get extra endurance and int/wis.(PS&amp;SV)

Currently the only changes augments make on how an item appears is the name (ex: ""Blessed"" Faith-Forged Helm is the name given when saintstone is added to Faith-Forged Helm), and the stats are updated. 

It is difficult to tell, when purchasing an item from the auction house, which stats are increased, and how powerful the augment is. Any rarity level of saintstone added to a crafted item changes the name to ""Blessed __,"" whether the augment is green or epic. 

You can tell how much the stats have been increased by comparing the item to one that is augmented. Normally this consists of searching a database site like rift.zam and doing some subtraction. However, since augments add varying amounts of stats depending on which slot the item fills, and because some augments boost two separate stats, it is an unnecessary hassle to find out which exact augment is used. 

A simple solution will be to make augments appear just like runes. For example, a Faith-Forged Helm crafted with a Pure Saintstone (rare quality) would look like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/OqvIC.png) (warning: image was made in MSPaint.)

Using an epic augment would appear similarly, except the text would read ""Flawless Saintstone / Wisdom + 7"" and the text would be purple. 

This change would make it much easier to see how much an augment affects an item, and which type of augment was used. Also, the difference in value beteen two similar items crafted with different levels of augments will be more apparent. Since items crafted with epic augments look similar to those crafted with uncommon or rare augments, save for a stat difference (which may not be apparent unless you have another item to compare it to), it is almost worthless to add an epic augment to a crafted item, if you intend on selling it. 

Another suggested change: Augments should no longer change the name of an item. Right-clicking an item from your bag to search for it in the auction house will only return results crafted with the same type of augment, which makes comparing items more of a hassle. Also, with the current state of augments, database sites end up with cluttered results, as shown [here.](http://rift.zam.com/en/search.html?q=faith-forged+helm) Another (far from gamebreaking, but worth mentioning) downside is the game ends up with items with names like ""Rugged The Wall.""

Clerics, right now, have some incredible AoE power and it's a very exciting and fun class to play.  As such, a lot of people have been trying it out and coming by for spec advice.  What I'll give, here, is a brief spec progression up until level 31 along with some tips.  I don't have the particular motivation to get into great detail (right now), but, if you have any questions or suggestions for other specs, comment away!  I'll reply.

Brief summary to help explain the choices - Inquisitor will be our main tree.  Soul Drain is an extremely effective AoE skill.  When combined with Fanaticism and followed up with Circle of Oblivion, it's rather devastating.  (Most of the confusion, though, comes from what to do before you unlock CoO.)  The problem here is that Soul Drain has a 10 second cooldown, which means we have no spamable AoE - Cabalist to the rescue!

Combining these two trees gives us solid AoE for small groups (3-5).  Now, we just need a little somethin somethin to keep us alive.  Enter Sentinel.  Which, along with heals, bring some nice DPS enhancement.  

__________________________

Anyway, enough with the banter, here are the build:

&gt;-Level 10: http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdo..VLz.c (still stuck with single target killing here, sorry.)

.

&gt;-Level 16 (15 is still rather dull): http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdo..qxkb.V0z
Things are getting fun now.  Vex will heal you.  Soul Drain and Obliterate will destroy AoE packs.

From this point, until level 31, the AoE rotation is such:

-Vex 3 mobs (melee, preferably.  Otherwise, use LoS to make ranged come to you.)

-Soul Drain

-Decay (Ima chargin mah lazer)

-Obliterate

-Bound Fate


Then use instants to finish anything that may be left standing.  Shouldn't be much.

Now, keep dumping points into Inq.  Spare points go into Sent, this unlocks lots of fun toys.  Heals, buffs, instant damage.

At 31, we gain Access to CoO which means we no longer *need* Cabalist to support our AoE-ability.

I would, now, suggest respecing to this:
&gt;http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdo.V0x.yxkbMx0az

Now, from here out, there's really no reason to put more points into Sentinel.  Also, the 3rd tree becomes highly preferential.  Here are my top 3 picks for the 3rd tree:

1.  Purifier for the shield
2.  Justicar for passive survivability
3.  Cabalist for additional AoE/DoT DPS

Pick one.  Keep spending points in Inq and put the left overs into your third tree.

Rotation has changed, but only slightly.  Now, after pulling with Vex and setting up a big Fanat + Soul Drain, you spam CoO until Soul Drain can be used again.  Refresh Vex as necessary.

End-game AoEing build:
http://rift.zam.com/en/stc.html?t=00jdr.V0x.Exkigxzqz

Left over points go into 3rd tree of choice.

____________

A few tips:
-This build still allows for solid single target damage (needed while questing).  Rotation - Bolt of Depravity, Vex, Sanction Heretic, Bolt of Judgement spam, with Depravity when Life and Death Concord procs.  Refresh DoTs if necessary.

-DoTs tick for their first tick of damage immediately upon application.

It's an extremely cool healing mechanic, and I feel like I'm very dynamically interacting with the group (Pain Xmission, Feast of the Fallen, etc), doing good damage, and putting out consistent mitigation and heals. It's a *little* bursty for my tastes, and when the tanks health starts getting low I don't feel like there are really good 'OH SHIT' abilities aside from Explosive Growth and Loathsome Restoration in sequence, but I wager it's much easier keeping stacks of Foul Growth on the tank once I get Unholy Nexus.

1 ) What is the 'order of damage' on a target? I.e., if I cast Symbol of the Torch on a target (which doesn't count as a healing spell in terms of proccing our Husk of Indifference), and the shield absorbs damage, will that proc Bond of Pain? To this end, is it a bad idea to pair Purifier with a Defiler spec? I'm presently running Defiler/Cabalist/Warden, and while the Warden AoE heals are more convenient, they're a bit underwhelming in dungeons, and certainly not as potent as Feedbacking Foul Growths.

2 ) Hypothetical; Say there are two Defilers, A and B, and A puts Link Agony on B, and B puts Link of Agony on A. If A takes 1000 damage, B will absorb 300 of that, and take 150. Will A then absorb 45 of that, and take ~22? And then B absorb ~6, and take 3? (And yes, less because of Scarred Heart) If so, I feel like daisy chaining Links could make a group of Defilers pretty indestructible. 

3 ) Does Delicate Alteration include resists? As in, if I cast Marrow Harvest on a target, and they resist it, will Marrow Harvest immediately proc? ",Classes/Souls,False,self,t5_2s4an,1373039039.0,riftclasses,,True,t3_1hp073,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1hp073/defiler_hilarity/,

Please go to http://www.reddit.com/r/RiftIt/ to join us in our adventures! /r/RiftIt is the official subreddit for this guild ! Hope to see you all there! All discussion please refer to over there on /r/RiftIt please :) Thank you






~~Hello Redditors and adventurers of Telara!~~

~~After some positive feedback in my previous post I have started the motion and brought back the Reddit Rift guild.
~~
~~**RiftIt** is the wonderful name chosen and at the moment the ~~charter is still in need of more signatures~~ The guild is now formed!!!!! **RiftIt** is now in motion!. 
~~
~~In the early stages, the vision of RiftIt is to bring back a sense of community, wonder, adventure, and friendship back into this amazingly under-rated gem of an MMO. A guild based around fun and experiencing all that this game has to offer, all while not being on your ass about raid times or what gear to wear and using this set of gear over that set.~~ 

~~I envision RiftIt to last long into the late stages of the game, having us march together as a community against the Storm Legion and the coming war. Eventually raiding and taking down the baddies, all while holding true to the roots of just general easiness and good times and exploring the continents and discovering the mysteriousness of the Telaran world!~~ 

~~RiftIt will be sure to cater to everyone's playstyles and needs for the philosophy of a happy player in a happy guild will lead to an amazing experience for one amazing game.~~

~~We accept everyone of all backgrounds, ages, colors, classes, levels, gear sets, play-styles, anything and everything! The only requirement is that you play Rift!~~ 

~~We are located on the scenic server of Wolfsbane US on the Defiant side.~~ 

~~If you wish to join or if you have any questions, this will be the post to leave them! Also, leave your characters name if you're wishing to join and enjoy the game with all of us together and I will add you to my friends-list in game and thoroughly invite you to RiftIt!~~

~~I truly wish to see you all around~~


Edit 

~~**RiftIt** is now established!! The charter is signed and I'm slowly starting to grasp the power that is that of a Guild Leader hahaha. Going to make sure everything is going awesome and optimal and will see you all in game !~~ 

~~Oh yes and I forgot all along, my name is Snozzberry !~~ 

**Edit 2**

~~Anyone and everyone who wishes to join up please just leave your character's name here and I will add you to my friends list in game and get you into the guild! RiftIt accepts ALL!!~~

~~And again, we are located on the Wolfsbane server, there's also free weekly server transfers if you're not on Wolfsbane but wish to be apart of this growing community~~",Help,False,self,t5_2s4an,1344639078.0,rifthelp,defiant,True,t3_y01mc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/y01mc/new_reddit_rift_guild_riftit/,

1327625704.0,16,self.Rift,oyf1c,"Some suggestions for improving the /r/Rift community and experience, and increasing our membership",Dejime,18,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/oyf1c/some_suggestions_for_improving_the_rrift/,"(I know this is a wall of text: I'll have a TLDR at the end for people that don't have time for all this, but I put a lot of thought and discussion and want to fully explain my assessment of the subreddit and some proposals and hope that other community members contribute their ideas and thoughts as well for improving /r/Rift)

So I've been reading the threads of ""This subreddit is disproportionate to the amounts of players"" etc without a whole lot of discussion about how to do that, except for ""Look at the content/discussion! This is a great place to be!"" 

I respectfully disagree and have some proposals for both increasing the quality of content/discussion and the overall number of subscribers to /r/Rift. I'm going to make some proposals that I've come up with after a lot of thought and discussion with other Rift players in what they're looking for in a good community, and some other /r/Rift subscribers that have also expressed some frustration. First, a bit about me so you can take my opinion with a grain of salt. I'm the raid leader for an 11/11 HK guild and a fairly hardcore player, probably not the ""normal"" subscriber, so maybe I'm looking for something different in a community. But I think this discussion needs to be had, even if the majority of /r/Rift ultimately ends up disagreeing with my assessment.

I think the major reason for the lack of meaningful content is a lack of controls/understanding in the community about what ""good content"" means. I think that high level content is ultimately best, about the more difficult/intricate levels of the game, and less so ""Where should I roll a character / Thinking about picking up this game"" and other base questions, even though most of the players in this sub may be casual. Other successful gaming subs are successful because even casual players feel like the content of the community makes them feel like they at least understand the game at a high level and could get to that level if they wanted to. Even if you're a casual player who has no interest in doing raids at a high level and just want to go through the content after it's exceptionally easy and you can breeze through it, content about the endgame gives you some level of insight into what the hardcore guilds/players do. It makes people be able to experience/understand parts of the game that they wouldn't otherwise see. This makes the community more valuable. Even players that aren't serious about this game can see and appreciate how high level content works. I am a member of sc2/LoL communities and while I'm probably an above-average player, I could never be a top level player, but I love seeing their explanations/theories/etc even though I could never really contribute to them or implement them. I think that high-level content interests even casual players (but maybe I'm wrong)

What would you think if you were an average level 50 player who logged onto /r/Rift for the first time? Would you stay? What would you think of the content? There's no reason to stay because it seems to be a lot of ""Should I get this game?"" or recruiting for ""Reddit Guild #237"". That might be really helpful for the individuals involved (the recruiting guilds or the player seeing assistance) but it's incredibly boring for the rest of us.

So what should be done about this? I have two types of proposals: Cleaning up/organizing repetitive/noninteresting content, and increasing the level of quality content that most of the community finds useful and interesting.

First, the cleanup suggestions:

Clearly there needs to be some ability for people to ask ""Hey, I heard about this game but I'm not sure. I have some questions I'd like answered!"" The rest of us would like to not have to see dozens of iterations of this thread every few weeks. Perhaps there can be a thread in the sidebar with some FAQ with some questions and common answers: All of these ""Should I get the game"" seems to be almost the exact same thread to me, after a while. So maybe there should be a thread that's in the sidebar about ""Should I get this game"" that is replaced/cleaned up every month or so, as the questions and answers change every so often as the game evolves and new content is added.  I think something similar could be done with ""What server should I join"" threads - just have a thread like that with general comments collected about some popular servers and where people should start.

I also think that recruitment on /r/Rift needs to be substantially changed and regulated. There are a ton of guilds that recruit on here and it's incredibly annoying, at least to me. Most of these guilds aren't even ""Reddit Guilds,"" they're just guilds that for some reason feel like spamming it here is a good idea. Personally I'd like to see it banned outright, as the Rift Travel Shard forums are probably the places to go for that. At the very least I think that there need to be some controls, as I feel like this is the lowest level of content that contributes almost absolutely nothing to the community. 

Now about increasing the good content. How do I personally distinguish good content from neutral content from bad content? First, I think bad content is content like above, repetitive/really low level content that might be helpful to exceptionally new players but is really bare in its breadth. I like the threads like ""What's new in Rift"" or pretty comprehensive guides for new players, but little things like ""Did you know about the ""sell all grays"" button"" and little anecdotes in self posts I find to be borderline worthless. 

Neutral content is content that's cross-posted really widely around, like patch notes or something like that. It's good to have a compilation of that here, and I have no problem with that, but there would be no reason to be a part of the sub if neutral content was all that was here, as this neutral content is cross-posted on other community sites. 

Good content is the rest. It's content that is pretty high-level, unique or at least is very detailed, informative, and interesting to a majority of subscribers. As I argued earlier, content about the end-game (even just master mode dungeons, but especially raid content, content, from raid strategies to various build discussions to ""How to get the most out of this new patch's PvE changes/additions"" or whatever). It might give players something they can use or contribute to (new builds/suggestions on how to beat a boss they just can't/commentary about the current meta for certain classes, or whatever. 

So how do we get that content here? Admittedly those discussions are usually had on the official boards or more popular sites. That's obviously the difficult part. I haven't fully worked this out yet, so if anyone has real suggestions I'd love to hear them. Thoughts would be to encourage community members to write comprehensive content, but there's definitely a lot that's available elsewhere. 

Another suggestion for creating new, interesting content is to have a list of streams in the sidebar. Our guild streams our raids, and I know a number of other guilds (both hardcore and casual!) stream on here. Personally, I enjoy watching other guilds raid to give suggestions, maybe learn a new strat or just enjoy the social interaction of the group. Periodically I see guilds say they're streaming, and that's great, but it's hard to find and often downvoted by people. I think it'd be a great idea to have a stream list topic that's listed in the sidebar, where a person who wants to watch a stream can click on the topic and see a list of streams, organized by time of general streaming or general content (E.g. Guild A, streams M/W/Th 5-8 EST, RoS/GSB, Guild B, streams Su/M/Tue/Thurs/Sat, hardcore raiding), or whatever. I dunno how the community feels about streams but I feel like they're really interesting and it'd be fun to see other guilds and have a useful list to easily watch whenever we want. This is an easy way to ""create content"" and encourage people in the sub to see the ways that various guilds/players play.


***TLDR: There is too much bad content on this sub and not enough good content. I propose that to eliminate the bad content we come up with new restrictions on guild recruitment and have a single ""Should I get this game / Where should I roll / popular questions"" thread that is in the sidebar so that discussion doesn't get repeated several times a week. To create good content is less fleshed out, and I'd welcome serious suggestions. I also propose a stream list where people who want to watch Rift streams can go to find various streams, be they hardcore raiding, casual content, just running around, or whatever!

/r/Rift, please let me know what you like, what you don't like, and your own ideas! I want to see this community thrive like some of the other popular gaming communities around here, and I think serious modifications are needed to make this an interesting community that Rift players WANT to be a part of, because I just don't feel that way right now. Thanks for reading my massive wall of text. Please contribute to this thread, I'd love to see some real change come out of this, even if it isn't what I've outlined. I think this sub has to have a serious, frank discussion about what it wants and hopefully our combined heads can come up with some good ideas for improving the sub's content and subscribers!",,False,self,t5_2s4an,False,,,True,t3_oyf1c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/oyf1c/some_suggestions_for_improving_the_rrift/,

Therefore, +3 Loyalty per Credit

1,200,000 Loyalty @ 3 Loyalty/Credit = 400,000 Credits
400,000 Credits @ 18,500 Credits/100 Dollars = 22 purchases of Credits @ $100 each = $2,200.

Feel free to update your flair with your faction now. All the shard names were removed, legacy shard flairs will still exist. You can now type in your shard name once you've selected your faction from the list.


Feedback is welcome.


* SHARDNAME is where you type in the shard that you're on.
* Yes, I know you can set it to whatever you want - play nice.
* The shard name exists on mouseover currently. Will see what I can do in the future to make the faction logo's coexist with the shard names. :)

1296284345.0,15,self.Rift,fb81r,The defense of Scarred Mire. (AKA Why everyone should try RIFT),Shorvok,17,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/fb81r/the_defense_of_scarred_mire_aka_why_everyone/,"First of all, I would like to apologize I did not get any screenshots any of this, I wish I had, but in the rush I tried to take a few and was hitting the wrong key. Anyway, on to the story.

I had played RIFT before in beta 2, but I never got out of the starting area and into the actual world. Well in the current beta, 5, I got much more interested in the game and I got a Paragon/Riftblade/Beastmaster mix to 13 (I can throw ice covered swords at people that light them on fire then watch as they are jumped by a pissed off tiger-thing). I had been questing in the actual world in Freemarch and I had participated in a few rifts and other things including assaults by the Guardians and destroying their footholds.

I had heard from a friend of mine over ventrilo who had gotten trapped in the Guardian's questing area that they were completely being taken over. There were multiple camps taken over by the forces of Regulos and he finally managed to get out of the mess by getting a GM to teleport him, and we didn't think much of it. That was the first mistake.

About 20 minutes later a big message poped up saying the server was coming down in 30 minutes for an update. Right before, maybe 2-3 min before a rift started to defend Meridian, which involved multiple battles around the city and finally a big boss fight. I had seen it multiple times, and not thought much of it because it was much higher level than me so I couldn't participate yet and the played seems to always win sooner or later.

Well this time apparently there weren't enough people participating in the even and they failed. Meridian fell and became a giant army spawner for Regulos. Armies poured out of the city and people started freaking out in the general chat. The first camps to fall were close to the city (keep in mind these camps are not just for these events or something, this is where players are crafting and questing, and the same NPCs giving quests are fighting the mobs off). 

I was down questing at a place called Scarred Mire, a place full of undead and a ton of fellow players. The timer until the server restarted hit 20 minutes. I happened to open my map and notice a bunch of the purple ""X"" markers that indicate groups of invaders was headed right toward the Scarred Mire camp. So I stopped what I was doing and headed back to the camp, and I was almost there when the event started. I managed to get into a public group right as the mobs got there. There was no organization, just 8 players in a group and the NPCs of the camp against 20-30 mobs. The battle was intense, my pet died early on and I began to run out of endurance as the battle wore on. I slew 4 or 5 of the mobs, who were everything from armored void knights to skeletons that hurl fireballs. I happened to look around and noticed there were only 4 of us left, and most of the friendly NPCs were dead, but we were keeping them off the Wardstone (When a wardstone is destroyed the camp is either destroyed or transfers ownership to the faction that destroyed it). As I was just about to die I started getting healed by a Chloromancer that showed up, and a few more players joined the fight. I thought we might have a chance, but the mobs just kept coming. The time until the server restarted hit 10 minutes.

I died shortly after we were reinforced, and I respawned and got back into the fight. We weren't really winning, but we were not losing either. Hoping for more help we just kept killing, but just then the camp just to the northeast of us fell. Most of the mobs on the map that were fighting there started toward us, a force slightly smaller than the ones pouring into our area already. We were doomed.

To make it worse, these giant things I can only describe as tenticled blobs like something out of a Lovecraft novel joined them. They were scary looking, but I do not know what they did or how tough they were as we all died almost immediately when the second group got to us.

We respawned and started trying to retake the came, but it was infested by at least 50-70 mobs and fighting was almost impossible. We only had 3 minutes left, and we fought them until the server finally went down. 

We did lose the fight, and I haven't been back to check and see what happened as I left shortly after the server's went down, but I will say this is what it taught me: That the claims the developers made about areas being taken over and controlled by the different factions is real.

It's not even that they will take over pre-designated areas or that they will do so much and stop then players can whittle them down. These things took over more and more and as they did they became more powerful. If the server hadn't went down they may have taken over the entire region, I really don't know what would have happened.

But that aside, I gota say, this game is amazing. The fight was very unorganized and probably would have went better if people were communicating, but it was still probably the most fun I've had in an MMO since I played Everquest back before Luclin.

""Hey everyone. 

Yesterday, Daglar and I were talking about the pre-Storm Legion expert dungeons. Most of this conversation revolved around how much use any of them would see in a level 60 world. Our shared opinion was ""Not Much"". The topic then became if we were to take one of these and upgrade it into a level 60 expert with new awesome loot, which one would it be? 

However, it struck me that with a choice like this, why should we get all the fun in deciding which dungeon gets the love when it should be you, our customers, that decide. So, here I am posing the question to you guys!

Which of the pre-SL dungeons would you like to see upgraded to a level 60 expert difficulty version complete with new mechanics and brand new, super sweet loot?

* Realm of the Fae
* Iron Tomb
* Darkening Deeps
* Deepstrike Mines
* Foul Cascade
* King's Breach
* Runic Descent
* Fall of Lantern Hook
* Charmer's Caldera
* Abyssal Precipice

Since Rift went F2P it seems that a lot of new players (including myself) 
had quite a lot of questions regarding this game, and asked them in this sub-reddit. this gave me an idea, maybe there could be a guide stickied to this subreddit including the basic concepts of rift, like how the cash-shop works, 'what is loyalty and how much do I get for each purchase', 'What build is viable for my class' and 'what is the deal with these ""SL"" souls and how can I get them'. And i'm sure there are a lot of other questions like these people new to the game would like to know. Also I think the guide should just be on the basics/mechanics of the game because I think discovering new things is one of the best experiences in a MMO.

TL:DR Guide for new players stickied to this sub-reddit.

Is taunting (Shield Throw, Spark, etc.) generating permament threat or temporarily glues the mob to me?
Do tanking souls have sort of a hidden threat multiplier?

I got bogged down in the level grind after rerolling and couldn't find the will to finish those last 6 levels.  The status of mage pvp circa launch was also a contributing factor for my having left.

After leveling at least 3 toons to around 35 and one to 50 in SWTOR over the last month, I realized that I do not really like that game for many reasons ranging from the lack of post-leveling content, my choice of a server that is now failing pop-wise coupled with no transfer option offered, that game's dev's odd ideas about pvp balancing, and others.

Anyway,  I read a post from someone else who was going back to rift and thought ""I really enjoyed that game"".

So I log in last night and find that not only have I accumulated the max rested xp over my absence (expected), but also that I had a package full of 2x xp pots .

With my 4x xp rolling I found that equal-level mobs were giving between 1650 and 2000 xp each (roughy .5% lvl/mob, 1/3 the xp awarded for finishing a quest).  A few rifts later ( probably 3-4 hours) and I was no longer mired at 44, but rather 47.

I am thrilled.

Good on ya Rift customer re-acquisition team!

I always had a non-specific gut feeling that this game just felt right.  I hope it continues.

Now, many of my RL friends and some old online friends from WoW are playing SWTOR together, and I've joined them.  I like playing with them a lot, but find myself constantly comparing SWTOR to Rift and finding Rift the superior game.  I only have about 12 hours in SWTOR (level 16) so I don't know if it's an accurate assessment yet.

I was just wondering if anyone else has been in the same boat and what your thoughts might be on the two games, playing with friends, etc.  I used to raid hardcore in WoW but these days I don't have the time (or desire) to put in that kind of work, so I'm not sure I could join a random guild in Rift and make new friends as easily as I used to.

Money is tight, and being unemployed I can't really afford it at the moment, even with these crazy deals I see on Steam and other sites. (If fucking only. Now of ALL the times.)

So, in your eyes, what are five problems with Rift you think should be known before the purchase of the game, and why did you buy it anyway aside from ignorance of said issues? Any regrets?

My friends and I are australian so we tried to roll on briarcliff, (since that had been picked as unofficial oceanic server) at launch - needless to say, due to the crazyness of the headstart queues (briarcliff is unofficial *everything* it seems) we soon gave up trying to get on that shard and ended up rolling on one of the new additional servers they added.  
  
Fast forward to now: it's a ghost town. The social aspect of MMO's is what I love about them, so I'd like to be on a decently populated server.  
I'd like to know what trion's long term plan is? Merges? Free transfers from high pop to low? Balloons? Candy?  
  
If I was trion i'd earmark one or two low pop servers as oceanic despite their physical location, and offer free transfers. *Then* merge the remaining low pop US ones.   
I'd do this not only to placate the oceanic players themselves, but because players in non-us time zones can make a server seem more deserted.  
eg. I notice no specific 'down time' on my server, regardless of when I am online. If our already low population is spread over a few timezones, there is never going to be a decent amount of us all online at the same time, and the server seems more 'dead' then it really is.  
  
  
**edit:**  
The aim for the servers is a population of 1500, but we don't know the thresholds for the low/medium/high server statuses. I think the 'medium' status could have a very wide range, which is giving people a skewed idea of the populations. (say 250-1200 maybe)

&gt; **shyntyrr asks**: 2.How large of a population will the servers be able to support (per server)?  
&gt; **chamberlin**: We're targeting **1500** players per server

I had to cancel my Rift subscription today because even though I love the game, I don't have the money to pay for a subscription right now, and my free time is so limited lately that I couldn't justify spending $15 a month for the time I was playing.

I went to my account management, went to payment management or whatever it is, and press cancel subscription. I was expecting the Blizzard-style guilting, but no, nothing. It cancelled right away, sent me an email saying how many days I had left on my active subscription, had a link to a survey so they could improve, and a simple, professional goodbye from Trion Worlds.

I felt like Trion deserved an answer to the survey due to the great job they're doing, and I was amazed that it was only two questions, why did you cancel, and what could we do to fix it. Nothing long, it was short, sweet, and to the point.

I've seen numerous people who believe that pre-ordering the digital collector's edition is the only way to participate. This is completely wrong.

According to Abigale, Sr. Community Manager on the official Rift forums, anybody who has pre-ordered the game will have access to the head start. That's pre-ordering the digital copy or physical copy, collector's edition or standard edition. All you need is the code that's given to you when you pre-order the game. Example: if you ordered it at Gamestop they will have given you a receipt with the code printed somewhere around the middle of the receipt. So please, let your friends know that they don't have to settle for the digital copy if they don't want to.


TL;DR: All pre-orders can participate in the head start, regardless if it's standard or collectors, digital or physical.

I decided to play a Warrior with typical Tanking souls. I did this to get a feeling about the class and the tanking capabilities. The fact that I wait 5 minutes at most for a dungeon queue is a great addition as well.

However, tanking specialities don't feel good when general questing comes in play -survivability is decent, but the damage is lacking. I tried all of the tanking Presets and a few tanking builds for leveling that I found on official forums.

My preference was towards the Paladin tree, but overall it feels that all those builds lack levels to really take off.
So far I am rocking the Paragon focused tree and I am quite pleased by it, but I still wish to try and play a tank.

I am near level 30, so what would be the most effective Tank build for leveling, bot for questing and casual dungeon runs ? ",Classes &amp; Souls,False,self,t5_2s4an,False,riftclasses,,True,t3_1gt7og,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/1gt7og/warrior_best_build_for_leveling/,

There should be two main options for you all to choose from, two called SHARDNAME once you click the guardian of defiant icon flair - this should allow you to input your shard that you're on. The other portion are the shard names themselves if you don't wish to use a faction icon.

To get a flair, simply click the checkbox to the left of ""Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:"". Then click the (edit) text link. A little popup window should appear and it should give you the shard options and other fun stuff.

Most gamers benefit greatly from playing; however, a small percent of gamers become addicted. The goal of this research study is to develop a measure that can quickly and easily differentiate the small number of addicted gamers from the majority of gamers who benefit from gaming. This measure will allow mental health professionals to identify addicted gamers and provide services to them while simultaneously protecting gamers who are not addicted from becoming stigmatized.

Below you will find a link to a study. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate in this study. Participation in this study should take about eight minutes. The study includes four brief questionnaires and a demographic questionnaire. At the end of the study is a link that will allow you to enter a raffle for a $20 gift certificate to Amazon.com Entry in the raffle requires that you are at least 18 years of age and provide a valid email address. This email address is kept separate from the study, i.e., you will remain anonymous.

1312296025.0,11,self.Rift,j6pyv,New to RIFT: my first thoughts,rbrumble,20,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/j6pyv/new_to_rift_my_first_thoughts/,"Hi Reddit Rift community.  

I've been playing Rift for about a week now and I wanted to get some initial thoughts down to inform anyone considering checking this game out.  In a nutshell: try it!  It's one of the best games I have ever played, and if you're coming from WOW, this is my perspective as well so a lot of what I wrote is based on my WOW experience.

Musings from a former WOW player:

I'm another WOW refugee, I played a Human Paladin tank on the Kirin Tor server from Fall 2005 until January of this year and then realized that WOW had lost my interest.  I tried one of the 7-day free plays just a week ago and realized that all the changes made had broken WOW for me - it was too easy, and required no investment in time or effort anymore.  After two days, I gave it up (again).  The way insta-que works now you can get from 10-cap without leaving your capital city.  Booorrrrrring....

Musings on Rift:

Graphics:

Compared with WOW, the graphics are like night and day, there is just no comparison.  Many times while playing Oblivion I thought, this would make a superior looking MMO.  Well, it was true, Rift makes WOW look like Warcraft compared with Warcraft 2.  The graphics are more realistic, with bigger models.  The detail on everything is impressive, from pets to clothing to spell effects.

Gameplay:

Again, no comparison.  The beginning storyline leading to your first Rift event, the story line teasers released along the way, the way quests are obtained and handed in, the satisfaction of levelling up is all a much more satisfying experience in Rift than it was for me with WOW.

World:

The world in Rift is much more interesting than WOW as exploration can be delayed by the appearance of one or more Rifts.  The additions to the game experience Rifts allow cannot be described.  Saturday night I was trying to get out of Sanctum to complete some quests, and the city was locked down by seemingly endless waves of goblin invaders.  The realism this adds to the game is unlike anything WOW offered.  You feel like this is a living world, and if you do not help stop the invasion, or help close the rift, than your world will fall.

Community:

Compared with WOW, the Rift community seems to be more mature and helpful.  I have even done quite a bit of RPing, and I'm on a pvp server (Faemist).  I keep bumping into the same players at Rift events, and they always say hi and mentioned where saw each other last.  If I'm in trouble with a mob in Rift, and someone is near, they have always stopped to help.  In WOW, I was used to people walking/running past me while I died.  From the look of some of the guild names on my server (one of them is called the ""Ironforge"" something) there are more than a few WOW refugees on Faemist.  For those used to ""Barren's chat"" and all the DBaggery that goes on in world chat in WOW, I have seen none of this on Rift.  The player base appears to be more mature all-around.

PVP:

While I haven't done a ton of pvp in Rift, I have completed about 10 rounds of the first map where you need to hold the fang, and it is at least as satisfying as pvp in WOW.  For quite awhile pvp was the main focus of my WOW gaming, and I really need to spend more time with Rift to give a fair assessment of the pvp experience. 


These are MHO, for what it's worth.  I actually am so impressed with this game, I wrote it to encourage all the WOW-playing fence-sitters to give it a shot, they won't be disappointed.",,False,self,t5_2s4an,False,,,True,t3_j6pyv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/j6pyv/new_to_rift_my_first_thoughts/,

&gt;Morning guys,
&gt;
&gt;We've already got some people looking at the Tar issues, and they will be patched up in one of our next updates early this week. Also keep in mind 1.4 is right around the corner and may be up before the next hotfix, so when you hear ""this will be fixed in the 1.4 patch"" don't think weeks, think days at most.
