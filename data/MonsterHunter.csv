Like a lot. I usually try and occupy my time programming and building databases for random things. 

I spent all night thinking about making a monster hunter database, with tables for inventory, armor, weapons, and combo lists. It would be able to tell you what items you needed to craft / upgrade and such. 

It would use SQLEXPRESS and C# to accomplish all this.

Would /r/MonsterHunter be interested in this? If so, I'll start today :)

I will probably parse the strategy guide's text and insert them into a database, then write a windows app to show all the data and stuff.

Lemme know what you think!

**Foreword:**

Hello, I'm Shirley, and go by Atelier.shirley (feel free to add!) on the nintendo network. I draw, write, hunt dragons, bake stuff, and love coffee &amp; tea.

I've been hunting since MH2 back in '06. Every time a MH title came out, I would often play the JP version first - mainly because I speak the language, and also because my friends mainly played the japanese versions as well.

With each version I'd usually be the one buying the Nintendo Weekly/ Dengeki Playstation magazines and translating information en masse - usually when the release dates draw near.

I did this for P2, Tri, P3rd, a bit for 3G, and now a copy of the June issue of Dengeki Nintendo is on my table - Tigrex is staring at me from the cover.

I've never been a fan of community segregation - honestly I wished JP and EN servers can just all be mixed together, without any of the silly fees of the JP side and all that.

Wishful thinking aside, I am willing to translate the pages (and scan/photograph 'em) for the reddit MH3U community. While I don't think I've met any of you in game before, the atmosphere here is largely friendly, and since I usually choose only one site to translate on, this time round I thought reddit would be a more widely-accessible platform as, say, a random forum on the net somewhere.

- - -
**Translation Ethic:**

While I have enough knowledge of Japanese to live and work in Japan, translation is another ball game altogether. I am primarily going to make sure that the information is *correct*. Some things in JP do not translate well to EN, so I will be taking some liberties here and there.

I would also like to say that I work on these things at my own pace. If someone else is able to translate faster and wants to start their own thread/ merge info, I don't mind at all. I don't care for upvotes, and my intentions are non-profit. I do this as a service to my fellow hunters, so I'd appreciate it if I don't get bombarded with ""WHEN MOAR?!?!?"" and the like. 

As such I hope to be able to work on this at my leisure as I sip my tea at night (and maybe after some hunts!). While I won't disappear wholesale, do expect updates to come in small chunks.

I can be reached for further inquiries @ateliershirley on twitter, or PM on reddit.

**[1] New Action System(s)**

| [Systems Page 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8825190940/) |

- As seen in trailers and information released about MH4 so far, the most defining trait of this new work is the ""3D Hunting Action"". This basically refers to the two-layered areas, differing in terms of elevation. Monster's movement attacks take this into account, and said geography can also be destroyed to bring about even more variation to the hunting field. 

**[The New ""Wall Movement"" System]**

- Up until now, the vines in Monster Hunter are only scalable vertically, and hunters are vulnerable to attacks when climbing. Remember all those times you got stung off the vines by Bnahabaras and other annoying bugs? Not anymore! In MH4, hunters can attack with their **Hunting Knife** (your carving knife), perform evasive maneuvers, and use items! 

- However, monsters can climb terrain too, bringing about a new dimension of suspense to your hunts. 

**[""Jump Attack"" and ""Mount Attack!"" An all-new way to tear your favourite wyverns apart!]**

- As mentioned above, there will be areas in the field with different elevation. Although Monster Hunter fields have always been relatively flat affairs until now, all this is about to change from MH4 onwards, with the system promoting a kind of ""smooth movement"" between the high and low ground. 

- After jumping, the hunter can perform a variety of jumping attacks. Jumps are performed by simply holding the R button down and leaping off a cliff, like you would in MH3U and any other MH game.

- Pressing the X button in mid-jump will initiate the jumping attack. This attack differs by weapon. For more information on jump attacks, please refer to *""[8] Old Weapons, New Moves""*.

- Mount attacks are a special kind of attack which causes the hunter to attach him/herself to the back of a large wyvern monster (there goes my Jaggi riding dreams). 

- The Mount attack is initiated when the Jump attack connects with certain points (hitboxes, probably) of a large monster. In this mode, the hunter can repeatedly stab the monster with their Hunting Knife.

- A Mount attack gauge will be visible upon successful initiation. If the gauge depletes, the hunter is sent flying. You also lose Hunting Street Cred.

- As no one likes to be mounted and repeatedly stabbed, the unfortunate dragon will attempt to shake you off by trashing about wildly. The hunter can hold on tighter by pressing R. If the hunter is not shaken off and successfully guards against this trashing frenzy, they will be able to utilize a bigger window of opportunity and... **stab their victim even more!**

- **[Basic Event Flow]**: Find High Ground &gt; Proclaim **""I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND!!""** &gt; Jump off to demonstrate your superiority &gt; Press X to jump attack &gt; Hit the monster's back, initiate Mount Attack &gt; Get Hype &gt; Press R to hold on tight &gt; Press X to stab &gt; Repeat &gt; ???? &gt; **PROFIT**


**[The ""Berserker Wyvern Virus"" System]**

*""The Berserker Wyvern Virus! A rage above rage mode?! And it affects hunters too?!""*

- Much has changed in the world of MH4, and one of these changes presents itself in the form of a mysterious virus that appears to infect wyverns.

- This virus changes their appearance, and causes them to become even more dangerous than before, granting their victims unnatural bouts of speed and berserker strength.

- A sure-fire way to tell if a wyvern has been infected is to look at its eyes! Infected wyverns become enveloped by a purple cloud/ aura, and gain red, bloodshot eyes.

- If the wyvern already HAS red, bloodshot eyes, look out for the purple swirling cloud. Can't miss it.

- The origins of the Berserker Wyvern Virus are still unknown, but it seems to have originated from Tigrexes, and since then confirmed sightings of this phenomenon has occurred across a number of species. 

- Even wyverns that we are familiar with gain new attacks and unpredictable movement patterns, bringing a new dimension to the hunt that has never been seen before. *Please take all of my money so I can fight an Infected Yian Kut Ku.*

**[The Berserker Virus and You]**

- When a Hunter is hit by certain attacks of an infected wyvern, they, too, will be infected by the Virus.

- However, this merely causes the Hunter to carry the infection. The ""disease"" does not activate instantly, but instead builds up over time.

- An ""Infection Gauge"" will appear beneath the hunter's name upon taking an infection-capable attack. If the hunter continues taking attacks from the monster, this gauge increases, and when it completely fills the hunter becomes infected. This is an ailment state.

- However, there is a way to cure the infection! As per Monster Hunter tradition, the infection is apparently cured by repeatedly attacking the wyvern that infected you in the first place.

- This effectively translates to: **""Beat the living** *censored* **out of the fool that bit you""**. After landing enough attacks on the target, the hunter's immune system somehow **CONQUERS** the virus, causing the hunter to enter **Berserker Mode**.

- In **BERSERKER MODE** (for emphasis, you know), the hunter gains an attack and affinity buff, allowing them to land more critical hits. The statistics on this buff are as of yet, not known.

- It is worth noting that the hunter loses all natural recovery ability when infected with the Virus. 

- Confirmed wyverns that carry the infection: **RATHIAN, VELOCIDROME, GYPCEROS, CONGALALA, TIGREX, KUCHYAWACHA.** HRH Yian Kut-Ku's attendance remains to be seen.


**[Viruses? Is this Resident Monster now?!]**

- The spread of the Berserker Wyvern Virus has apparently been rapid, and ""infected"" wyverns quests are considered to be quests of high difficulty.

- Wyverns can be already infected, or become infected in the middle of a quest.

- It is not known if ""Free Hunt"" monsters can suddenly become infected as well.

- The origins of this virus can only be traced to ""Tigrex"". So far not much is known about the virus, but my personal guess would lead us to the usual suspects of an Elder Dragon. This does add some nice lore to our traditional 24/7 Bossfight MH, so, infections for everyone and all that.

- A snake wyvern that burrows into the ground and, well, has a very long body, being a snake and all. One of its attacks involve it coiling around the hunter to crush him/her.

- A dark wyvern that has ""sensing scales"". It is able to determine the position of the hunter by using said scales - they apparently read changes in body temperature in the wyvern's surroundings.

The Felynes are back, with forge-able kitty-armour. Can't say I'd miss Chacha and Kayamba, give me my kitties any day.

That being said, you'll have a Main-cat and a sub-cat, and both of them have apparently seen it fit to build a Felyne TANK. It shoots cannonballs at wyverns, from what I see. 

There's also a ""Felyne Rocket"" attack which involves a high-propulsion Acorn-Rocket... designed to smash into its target and explode.

**Afterword**

From the response I got the answer was a resounding **YES**, so I'll keep blowing into this Ram-horn and try not to get triple-carted by Transly-dios.

1363974802.0,148,self.MonsterHunter,1at7qw,A Monster Hunter 3U guide for new players,adremeaux,172,24,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1at7qw/a_monster_hunter_3u_guide_for_new_players/,"Here are some tips for noobs that should help you get a handle on the game faster, as well as explain some more confusing aspects of the game. 

**First off:** ~~do your weapon tutorial.~~ (edit: apparently this game no longer has weapon tutorials. wtf? Well, go outside and try to figure out all your moves, see below). Like, right away. Though the weapons don't have huge movesets like Devil May Cry or something, they have enough that you should some time memorizing all the moves of your chosen weapon. Most weapons have three kinds of moves: fast pokes, medium length attacks, and slow, heavy hitters. All of these moves are useful in different situations. Some weapons also have evasive attacks, some weapons have KO attacks, and others have attacks that combo into blocking stance or sheath. There are also some moves that have great vertical reach, and some that have great horizontal reach. Movesets are also slightly different underwater, and some moves underwater hit *below* the fighter which is very useful.

edit: For your moves: you'll an X attack and an A attack. Try seeing how these two basic moves combo into each other. For instance, Long Sword has X -&gt; X -&gt; A loop that you can repeat. Then try moves with X+A, and see if you can combo these too. Finally, try R moves, which are usually *special moves*. These may combo or give you powerups, or just block. In addition, some moves can charge (notably hammer and great sword). After you've got all that, check your unsheathe attacks. You'll usually have two different ones: unsheathe with X, and unsheathe with X+A. I don't know the specifics of all the weapons, but with Longsword if you unsheathe with X+A you'll go right into the spirit combo (R button move), and with Switch Axe you'll go straight into sword mode. **It's really an enormous shame that the game doesn't have weapon tutorials anymore**, I can't believe they would exclude that, of all things.

edit edit: Hunter's Notes &gt; Hunter Info &gt; Basics &amp; Controls &gt; Weapon Guide for a written guide. Not perfect, but better than nothing.

It is up to you to know these moves, and know them well. You will be using all of them.

**Questing**

There are three types of quests in the game: free hunting, village quests, and guild quests.

Free hunting involves simply leaving Moga Village and killing whatever is around the D. Island. Doing so will gain you *Resource Points* to use around the village for upgrades, farming, and fishing. Each monster you kill will give you resources, and items you gather in the field can also be traded in for resources. When you've returned from your hunt, talk to the Elder's Son (the guy standing up on the box right in the middle), and pick *Hunt Report*, and this will tally up all of your kills and additional points, and you'll get some items, too. Normally, you'll want to send most or all of these items to the box, as they are resources for crafting and combining that you don't need to have on your person.

Village quests are the core of the beginning of the game. These are single player quests of modest difficulty and will ease you into the game. You get these by talking to the lady behind the booth in the north west part of town. These involve either gathering a bunch of resources, killing a bunch of small monsters, or killing a large monster. Eventually it will be nothing but killing large monsters once you get far enough. 

Guild quests are primarily for multiplayer, though you can play them single player too if you are masochistic. Though they have many of the same monsters as single player, the monsters are significantly harder. They do more damage and take less, and the general difficulty of monsters you fight ramps up way faster. You really shouldn't be touching guild quests until you are comfortable with single player and at least up to 3* village quests. To access guild quests, you need to talk to the guy near the boat and travel to the *Marina* or *Tavern*. On the right side of the screen in the tavern, there are 3 people behind a counter that can give you guild quests. If you play online, you'll be getting all of your quests from here. 

**Quest info**

When a quest begins, you'll see a blue box and a red box near your starting position. In the blue box are *quest supplies*, which you should absolutely take every time you start a new quest. You'll get a *map, rations, first aid med, paintballs, mini whetstones, and possibly traps or bombs, cool drinks or hot drinks*.

The *map* is straight-forward: it shows you a map of the area. This is optional, but you probably want it.

*Rations* are a critical item. The yellow bar up top is your stamina gauge. It starts out with a max of 100. If you eat a ration, it will grow its max by 25. If you eat another, it will go up to 150, it's max. **You should eat two rations at the start of every quest**. Having 150 stamina is a huge advantage, and basically free since the rations are free at the start of every quest.

While we're on the subject of rations: meat. Many monsters drop ""raw meat."" Using your BBQ spit, you can cook the raw meat into rare steak (which behaves exactly as a ration), or well-done steak. Well-done steak is like a double ration, growing your stamina by 50. If you run out of rations or don't have any, eat a well-done steak if you need stamina. You should always carry well-done steak around with you.

*First Aid Med* is the same as a basic potion. We'll cover potions further below. 

*Paintballs* are used to mark large monsters. If you throw a paintball at a monster, it's location will be marked on the map. They wear off after I think 15 minutes, so you'll need to mark them again if the fight is still going on. You should mark every large monster you encounter. 

*Mini-whetstones* are the same as regular whetstones. We'll talk about sharpness below.

*Hot drink* and *cold drink* are for cold and hot environments, respectively. To put it simply, if you'll be fighting in the desert, use your your cold drink at the start and you should be fine. For the tundra, use your hot drink. If you don't use these, you'll either lose health or stamina faster.

*Sonic bombs, flash bombs, barrel bombs* are somewhat more advanced. The first two can be thrown at large monsters at various times to stun them. This is monster specific, but if the bombs are in the supply, you may as well take them and trying throwing them when monsters are doing special things like flying or howling and seeing what happens. Barrel bombs are for straight damage; you can set them up while a monster is sleeping and detonating them by hitting them for an easy chunk of damage.

*Traps* and *tranq bombs* we'll talk about below in trapping. 

**Most supply items are automatically lost at the end of a quest**. Map, first aid med, rations, mini-whetstones, ""EZ"" bombs will be returned. However, paintballs and tranq bombs you get to permanently keep. Sweet! 

When a quest is complete, you'll get a handful of rewards, mostly monster parts. Send these all to the box: they'll be used later for crafting weapons and armor. You'll also receive a set amount of money.

**Combining**

Combining items is key to your success in Monster Hunter. Most combinations can and should be done via the box in your home, using *combo list*. **Do not randomly combine items without the list**, there is zero point. All combinations in the game are on the list, so don't start guessing.

When you look through the list, if a spot is greyed out, you don't have the supplies to make it. If the ?????s are white, then you can make it. Do so. Once you've made an item from the list once, the name will be revealed. You should try to make every item in the list once so you know what it is for the future. Your box has tons and tons of space, so don't worry about it running out. 

**Potions**

The most important items you can make via combining at potions. These are the first two items in the combo list: potion and mega potion. A *potion* comes from an *herb* and a *blue mushroom*, and a *mega potion* comes from a *potion* and *honey*. All of these ingredients can be found easily outside of town. A mega potion restores about twice as much life as a regular potion. You can carry 10 of each on your person, and should always do so. Never leave town without 10 potions, 10 mega-potions, a few well-done steaks, and some whetstones. 

**Farming**

Who the hell wants to sit around all day and gather herbs and mushrooms, though? As you progress through the game, you'll unlock things for your farm. Your farm can be used to trivially grow plants, mushrooms, honey, and bugs. The farm can be found via the south east exit from town. Talk to the guy up top and set your cats up to farm whatever you need. To start out, make sure you have tons of herbs and blue mushrooms, and combine them to make yourself lots of potions: you'll need them.

**Fishing**

You'll soon get fishing boats, too. You can send these guys out to bring you back free shit for the cost of resources. The first page of destinations will bring you lots of fish. Fish are mainly used in creating ammo, but sometimes they are used for some weapons. The second page of destinations will bring you ""treasures."" Some treasures can be sold for nice amounts of money (the eggs), others can be traded for resources. **If you send the boats to the treasure areas, they are self-sustaining** in terms of resources used/generated. Trade your rusty parts and broken fossils or whatever to the Elder's Son for more resource points. 

Oh yeah, while we're talking about resource points: **download all of the DLC next time you boot up your game**, one of the DLC's is a free 5000 RPs which is huge. It will automatically install.

**Armor sets and skills**

*Your skills don't activate unless they are at least +10*. If you have +7 sharpness, +5 attack, +4 fire resistance, *that does absolutely nothing*. Thus, you want to pursue full armor sets rather than pieces here and there. A full armor set will always get at least two skills to +10, usually three. *I recommend a Great Jaggi set to start with*. If you kill 5-10 great jaggis, you can make the full set. It's a great set. Put a few +1 attack gems in it as well to get to +15 attack for *Attack Up (M)*. 

Also, always upgrade your armor defense with armor stones right away. *You will get tons of armor stones over the course of the game*. Don't be afraid to use them, and don't hoard them. Heading into my HR quests, I have 99 regular armor stones and over 50 armor stone+s. 

**Sharpness**

Last part before fighting. Weapon sharpness is critical for fighting. A sharper weapon deals more damage and pierces thick enemy hides. You can see your sharpness in a sword icon below your health/stamina bar. As you attack, your weapon will lose sharpness, eventually taking it to a lower color category, from green to yellow to orange to red. You should never, ever be attacking with an orange or red sharpness weapon. To resharpen, use a whetstone and you'll be back at max.

Generally, you should try to get to a weapon with green sharpness ASAP. Quropeco's wings and all of Barroth will bounce if you are in yellow. **If you bounce, you are fucked**. Don't bounce. Stay sharp. Check the [weapon trees](http://www.gamefaqs.com/wii-u/683294-monster-hunter-3-ultimate/faqs) for upgrade ideas. Don't be afraid to run multiple lines of your weapon at once. I've currently got 7 different long swords going. 

**OK, can we talk about Fighting yet?**

Here are some random pointers for fighting big monsters:

* If you are getting hit a lot, you are attacking too much. The early monsters all telegraph their attacks. For ultimate safety, after they attack, run in and take *a single swing* then dodge away and prep for the next attack. As you learn their patterns, you may be able to get in a couple more hits

* Hit monsters in the head for more damage.

* Sometimes, when you hit monsters with a powerful blow, they will flinch and their attack will be interrupted. Once you get used to the game, you may be able to predict flinching and use it to your advantage. 

* Pay attention to what the monster is doing, not yourself. When a Great Jaggi pulls back and twists his body, he's going to do his powerful headbutt. When a Quropeco claps its wings together, it's going to do the fire leap. **Every enemy attack has a different telegraph**, though some are more obvious than others. Learn them.

*Arzuros:*

* Easiest big monster in the game

* Don't feel safe attacking his back. He has a nasty turn-around strike. *Don't be greedy.* 

* Not much else to say for him

*Great Jaggi:*

* The original easiest monster. Be wary of his headbutt. When he howls, you can land a few free blows.

* When he does his tail attack, he's going to do it again. In fact, **nearly every monster in the game does their tail attack twice in a row**. Get used to it. 

* He's relatively quick, so play it safe. Don't be greedy. Attack once or twice and clear out. 

*Quropeco:*

* The first real tough fight in the game. Has a lot more health than Great Jaggi.

* When he claps twice slowly (TAP—TAP) he's about to do his fire leap, twice. When he claps twice quickly then a third time slowly (TAPTAP—TAP), he's going to leap 3 times.

* If you are on fire, roll 3 or 4 times to put it out, or roll in the water. Do this before continuing fighting.

* He does his tail spin twice in a row.

* When he is flying, approach him from an angle. I think his only flying attack is the slimeball spit which hits mostly in front of him. In general, he is relatively safe when flying.

* When he puffs up his red thing and starts dancing from side to side and clapping, *own the shit out of him*. It's a taunt and he'll be vulnerable for quite a while during this.

* You are relatively safe right in front of him, but be wary of his charge.

* Wings/flints require green sharpness to pierce.

*Barroth:*

* The true trial for most players.

* Do not fight him with a weapon without green sharpness, you will regret it.

* Unless you are a hammer, do not attack his head. You need blue sharpness to pierce his head. You do not want to bounce.

* When he shakes himself out, you can get covered in mud. If you are covered, you can either use a *cleanser* (they'll be in the supply), or you can just wait about 10 seconds and it will go away. Generally, when he shakes it's worth the risk of running in for a few free hits because mud isn't that bad.

* You can break mud off his body parts, leading to extra damage. *Also, once the mud is off a part, it won't come off that part when he shakes out.* So if you break the mud off his rear, when he shakes out you can freely run in and strike without worrying about getting muddy.

* After his charge attack, his tail will come swinging. Watch out. 

* Pretty much all of this guy needs green sharpness to pierce, at least until the mud comes off. **Do not fight Barroth unless you have a green sharpness weapon**.

It has an active chatbox too, if you have any spur of the moment questions there's usually someone around to answer.  As well, none of these apps are my own.

That said:

****

##[MH3U 'Dex'](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6819-mh3g-dex-for-beginners/)

Think pokedex, from the pokemon series.  It's a small program that provides almost everything you'd need to know about anything on the following pages:  Monster, Location, Weapon, Armor, Jewel, Quest, Item, Combination.

Each page has probability percentages (for example monster carve, capture and limb carve items and percentages), what items can be used where (or where to get them), etc.  You can get from one page to another by double clicking an item as well, and sort columns to find what you need quickly.

Definitely my favorite one, super useful for knowing where to get that specific item, and what your best chance would be.

****

##[Athena's Armor Set Search](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/5304-athenas-armor-set-search-for-mh3g-and-mh3u/)

This one is a program that allows you to input criteria, and it will try to find armor sets that match what you want (and you can sort it by criteria as well, my favorite being base defense, rarity and difficulty).

You can put what offline and online rank you are, as well as what your charm table is and pick the skills you want, and it will come up with X amount of solutions for the optimal armor and gem combination to get the skills you want.  Super useful for min/maxing your armor.

****

##[Athena's Fish Finder](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6821-athenas-fish-finder/)

If you've been asking around and trying to find out what charm table you are on, this app will do it for you.  You just send your boats to the first fishing area without any mods (except for the paddle), and put the results in the app and it will eventually narrow down what charm table you are on.

****

##[Athena's Charm Table Search](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6766-athenas-charm-table-search-for-monster-hunter-3g-monster-hunter-3u/)

This is the last one.  It basically gives you every possible charm available, narrowed down by charm table.  Useful if you are looking or hoping for a specific charm, and to see if you can actually even get it on your charm table (or if you are trying to decide what charm table to get).

Hope these help!

The other moderators and I have been seeing a lot of posts lately with a ""report"" filed on it. The problem with this is, the reported post is always within the first 2 or 3 pages, meaning it has been upvoted more in the post's early life than downvoted, meaning the community has deemed it relevant/funny/informational/accurate or otherwise worthy of being here.

I know some people are unhappy with meme's making their way to our subreddit. I know some people are unhappy with how many people are receiving Rathian Plates (or rubies or gems or whatever else). But your way of showing displeasure at these posts is the downvote button, NOT the report button.

[Please refer to this link for information on Reddit's ""report"" button](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reporting). 

As you can see, the mods have not had to implement any rule regarding posts to our subreddit. Things that should be reported: ""Where do I find the Thieve's Guild in Riften?"", ""When do I get a mount in Azeroth?"", ""My City is STILL not letting be mayor because I use dial-up"".

As of my last perusal of our subreddit, [Here are things that should NOT be ""reported""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter).

If memes become a problem here like they did in /r/pics before /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu was created, then we'll do something about it. But they don't show up often, and when they do, they seem to be a variety of different memes.

Also, people are excited about their plates and rubies, and that's the way it is. If you don't wish for these posts to clog the subreddit, then feel free to exercise your right to downvote. It's a decision that has to be made my the community, not by one unhappy person with a ""report"" button.

I also wish to keep any policing by the mods at a minimum. I want our subreddit to be open to any hunter, new or old, with any post, informational or gloating or otherwise. /r/MonsterHunter is a place for everyone and everything that has anything to do with Monster Hunter. It's up to you to decide who gets front-page face time!

Sorry for the long (rather uncomfortable) post, but it had to be said.

Please feel free to comment on this post with any opinion, or message the mods, or even message me directly. I'm completely open to any criticism or opinion and I'm willing to consider all viewpoints.

Please upvote this post for visibility, as it is a self post for which i receive no karma.

Happy Hunting!

Also, there have been very many posts of screenshots of folks' new armor or kill screens, particularly in the past week. It has become a source for complaint, as people think these posts clog the subreddit. Milestone Monday was created as a place for hunters to share those stories, so please hold on to those screenshots until Mondays. We will allow such posts for the next week, but once next Milestone Monday hits, we'll begin removing posts that are submitted (unless such screenshots accompany a question or report of a bug. If the post exists solely as a ""look at me!"", then we'll have to remove it).

**Wii U Users!** Cross-Region Play, as well as Off-Screen play on the Gamepad is released today in the form of a patch! When you start the game, you will be notified that an update is available, and you can continue to play while it downloads, so you have the ability to install it later if you wish.

**A Strange Breed** *(Requires HR3)* - Hunt two Baleful Gigginox in the Land Arena for a material to craft [Rising Soul](http://images.wikia.com/monsterhunter/images/1/10/RisingSoul-SS.jpg), a Longsword, and [Voltage Verve](http://u.jimdo.com/www44/o/sa2759b64d54f29f1/img/i56a2f84b55710671/1358451075/thumb/image.jpg), a Hunting Horn, with Red/Green/White notes on its unupgraded form, and Red/Green/Purple on the upgraded counterpart. (I can't actually find a picture of, just imagine this one with the same color scheme as Rising Soul.) Both of these weapons have decent raw, and good Lightning damage, as well as 3 sockets when they have been upgraded. One note for this quest if you're going solo - be careful, if you are inattentive, these two will combo the crap out of you. Absolutely not saying this out of experience after being carted.

**Herald of Prosperity** *(Requires HR8)* - Hunt a G-Rank Jhen Mohran. Fairly straightforward, at this time I am unaware if this Jhen will give a material specific to this quest or not, but seems to currently be the only method of obtaining G-Rank Jhen Mohran materials outside the Hallowed Jhen fight. (Wish I could post more concerning this quest, but my slacker self is still HR7.) Any input from those able to do this quest would be appreciated.


Additionally, we get two more titles this week, **Dondruma** and **VIP.**

Remember that these quests must be started from the tavern in Port Tanzia, and may be done either Solo or in Multiplayer.

**Edit 1:** Updated with Note Colors for the Hunting Horn, and notification about the Wii U version patch today.",,False,self,t5_2rron,1366105111.0,,DS,True,t3_1cg6zl,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1cg6zl/416_dlc_breakdown/,

On the IRC channel I got asked a lot about using bowguns for the first time.  I realized I was basically saying the same thing over and over, so this is my attempt at compiling the questions I got the most of and my answers, along with some very rough overview of the weapon in general.  This is neither an in-depth numbers analysis or a super basic tutorial: if you've played largely Blademaster style and wanted to try out Gunning, this might be for you.

(Disclaimer: None, some, or all information may be inaccurate or actually bad ideas.  I am not responsible if advice is not optimal: I am merely speaking from my own experience of hundreds of hours of bowgun-only playing and a couple hundred hours particularly in 3U.  Please consult your doctor before bowgunning.)



**1. Why would I want to shoot a bowgun?**

Bowguns are a satisfying weapon to play right and are extremely versatile.  They're unique in that you can be doing elemental damage, then reload and start doing status damage, then shoot raw all with the same weapon in the same quest.  Online, a bowgun can completely trivialize encounters and be a massive asset to the blademasters.  In exchange for their unique properties, you suffer increased vulnerability, complexity, and emphasis on positioning.


**2. Do I want to use a Heavy or Light bowgun?**

I'd say use both!  I think Heavy is better for raw damage and Light better for status and elemental, although you might find one just feels easier to use against a given monster.  For instance, I default to a HBG against Brachydios and Agnaktor, but use an LBG for the Raths and Diablos.


**3. Okay, so how do I shoot a bowgun?**

Hold on, buddy.  While blademaster weapons tend to behave pretty similarly in the same weapon type, bowguns have enough variables that you need to put an extra step of thought into it.  Namely, you're going to want to pick a shot type to focus on.


**4. What do you mean, pick a shot type?  There's like a trillion of them and it's a huge excel graph of numbers!**

Like I said, bowguns are pretty versatile and can use raw, elemental, and status (among more niche things), but you generally want to pick one type of shot.  Think of it like this: as a blademaster, you build an armor set to work with a weapon.  Well, bowguns ammo is like having lots of smaller ""weapons"" you work around.  You can pick a bowgun that fires that shot type well and build an armor set around that one.


**5. I don't know the different ammo types.**

These are the major six.

Normal: Raw.  As basic as it gets.  Ideal range is as close as possible.  Normal 3 bounces!

Pierce: Raw.  Pierces through monster and hits multiple times.  Ideal range is about 2-3 rolls away.

Pellet: Raw.  It's a shotgun!  Do not use online, you'll friendly-fire and piss off your team.  Ideal range is 2-ish rolls.

Crag/Clust: Raw.  The explosives.  Crag sticks and blows up, clust throws bombs everywhere.  Crag does KO damage!

Element: Flame/Freeze/Thunder/Water/Dragon.  Self-explanatory.  Doesn't seem affected by range at all.  Dragon S sucks.

Status: Para/Sleep/Poison.  Extremely potent.  A decent status gun can paralyze the same monster three times.  Any range.


**6. Six things!?  My mind is broken!  Which do I use!?**

Depends on the monster.  Normal and Pellet are pretty okay on anything.  Pierce against big/long jerks where the bullet can do all the hits it possibly can.  The appropriate element for the monster, and Status is best if you're in a team that can make good use of the openings you create.

Normal is easy to use because one set and you're mostly done.  Element's also easy to understand but you'll want several guns and perhaps armor sets to work with it.  Status is a little trickier, but not so much and a good paralysis/sleep is extremely appreciated for any team.  All three don't demand too much in terms of positioning.


**7. How do I know this is a good bowgun to use for a shot type?**

First, does it have an adequate clip size for the shot type?  4 is generally my magic number, but there can be (much) higher or lower.  Note that just because you CAN load a shot doesn't mean you should.

Does it have enough recoil to fire the shots at the fastest rate?  There's charts for this, but the easiest way is to go and fire it.  If it doesn't, you might want Recoil Down.

Can it reload the shots at maximum speed?  If it can't, you'll want some Reload Speed too.

Does it have deviation?  If the deviation is only to the left or right, don't worry about it, just get the feel for compensating.  If it has both (R/L) deviation, you might want to skip that bowgun.


**8. What armor skills should I get?**

Amusingly, ""what armor"" and ""what bowgun"" can answer each other.  If you have a bowgun in mind, get armor skills that enhance that bowgun: recoil or reload as needed, the appropriate damage up (or status up), other luxury skills as wanted beyond that.  If you have a gunning armor set already, you can just grab a bowgun that most closely matches it.
Luxury skills for bowgunning include the evasion+s, Evade Extender (especially for HBGs, you'll be rolling a lot with those), and, well it's more of a personal niche preference of my own, Combination Pro for normal gunning.


**9. Ah, fuck it, got any equipment recommendations?**

These are what I used while playing, and are focused more on ""easy to farm/work with"" over ""optimal"".


**Low Rank**

Peco: I started with this over Jaggi because Pellet Up is very strong, and pellet is a useful shot solo and early on.

Wroggi: Normal Up, Poison Immunity.  Easy to farm, Normal is always useful as either a main or backup shot.  Good armor to work with.

Rathalos: Yes, you have to get a plate, but it has pierce up and attack up, pretty solid LR pierce set.  Can gem in Fire Atk if you're into that.


**High Rank**

Wroggi: Guess who's back, back again, Wroggi's back, tell a friend.

Steel Uragaan: Knockout King and Artillery make this especially hilarious to use with the Demon's Isle gun.  Crag away!

Azure Rathalos: A solid Normal Up set with earplugs.

Jhen Mohran: Has Pierce Up and Defense Up.  I used this through the end of HR and ultimately took on Goldbeard with it.


**G Rank**

If you're at this point you should be probably mixing sets since a lot of g rank sets aren't good on their own IMO.  Most of them have Load Up over any specific shot-type up.

Azuros: No, really.  If you're just starting G Rank this is an easy set to farm (use Freeze S) to get the much-needed G Rank defense numbers.  Eventually you can turn this into your Better-Than-Leather gathering gear.

Nibelsnarf: Looks fairly stylish!  Also has Pierce Up.  If you had a freeze gun to farm Azuros you're ready to farm this guy.

Green/Nargacuga: Not fantastic on their own, but it's worth building these because it's so easy to mix in Evasion+1 with them.

Abyssal Lagiacrus: Notable for having Silver Bullet, which is Normal/Pierce/Pellet Up in one neat little package.  Worth it?  I don't think so, but if you can make it work, go for it.


**Bowguns:**

Thundacrus (LBG): Rapid-fires Thunder and Paralysis, has Water as a backup shot.  A very fun bowgun line against the Raths.  Double or even triple paralysis with Thunder follow-up can completely trivialize them.

God's Isle (LBG): This fucking thing.  It shoots Crag and Clust and Status and other shit you get it from ancientshards.  I don't like it but it's apparently good, so give it a spin.  Demon's Isle is the crappier, High Rank Rustshard version.

Jaggid Fire (LBG): Before you can enter High Rank to get the Nargacuga line, this is a very early-to-get pierce gun for Low-Rank.

Blizzard Cannon (LBG): Rapid Freeze, has Sleep for sleepbombing, and affinity.  Notable for absolutely slaying Diablos.


Nargacuga Line (LBG/HBG): I prefer the HBG.  The definitive pierce gun.


Ceadeus Line (HBG): This line of HBGs is my preferred for firing Normal.  It has a strong left deviation, don't worry about it.  You'll want Reload Speed +1 for fasted loading of Normal 2.  Has statuses but the reload is too bad.

Queen's/Empress Line (HBG): The alternative gun for Normal, but looks worse to me.  Does have Normal 3, though, which is a point in its favor over the Ceadeus line.

Jhen Cannon (HBG): Okay, I never actually used this one much.  But how can you turn down a heavy bowgun called Jhen Motherfuckin' Cannon?

Tropeco Gun (HBG): This line fires Normal, Pellet, and Flaming, eventually adding Thunder and Para to it.  Reliable and once it's upgraded to have Thunder, you can shoot two of the most common elemental weaknesses with some backup paralysis.  An HBG that'll last you all the way into G Rank.


Again, this isn't a List of Best Equpiment, simply the things I used that I found worked well or at least ""good enough"", were simple to use as far as bowguns go, and relatively easy to farm.  By the time you figured things out enough to disgaree with any of this, you're already beyond the scope of this FAQ.


**10. Wait!  What about the whole ""how to shoot a bowgun"" bit?**

What's there to say?  You roll and shoot.  Use third or first person view if you need to hit upwards a little (personally I spend a lot of time in first person view, but that's my style), but be sure to respect hip-firing.  Understand how long reloading takes and what monster animations let you reload with 0 risk.  Occasionally this can be as easy as taking a few steps to the right and reloading while the attack barely misses you.

There's no fancy tricks, no magic to bowgunning beyond positioning, timing, and a little bit of aiming.  Go shoot guns to understand them, but hopefully this gets you past the worst of it.


**11. Well, can you at least give me a bunch of parting, context-less advice?**

Heavy bowgun shields don't need a shield button OR auto-guard: if you're in position you just get to do it.  For limiters, LBGs generally like them on because rapid fire is good, and HBGs like them off because crouching fire can be meh, but you'll reach a point where you can eventually make the call for yourself and come up with viable strategies.  Elder dragons like Ceadeus and Jhen get their shit pushed in by Pierce shots because the pierce hits happen extremely fast for some reason.  Status seriously owns, use it.  Using armor skills to remove deviation is usually a waste.

Personally any ammo I can buy at the store I don't keep in my storage box because it's a waste of precious item box space.  Combination Pro is fun with Normal 2 because it gets you 4 ammo every combine, assuring 495 shots.  Always bring combines for status shots, it can get you that second status.  In the same vein, combines for your main shot becomes increasingly important at High Rank and nigh-essential in G Rank.

LBGs sheathe fast enough, and you're relatively far away: this means you're in a fine position to lifepowder or use flash/sonic bombs.  Armor, Demon, and Recov usually aren't worth using but you can give them a try when the blademasters are busy sharpening or whatever.  All three can affect the monster, so watch your damn aim.  

For a good time, get a good para gun (even Thundacrus works), armor up for Status +2, bring combines, have 3 blademaster friends and triple-paralyze a silver or gold Rath, laughing your way to gleem and mantles.  Don't ever fucking use pellet online but if you're a badass like me you can aim pellet in such a way that it doesn't hit the blademasters anyway, this takes intense knowledge of pellet's cone of fire.  Ignore everything but the first six words of that last sentence.

Now, before you go duh, watever, and pfft, listen up. People argue that the teamwork that comes from playing multiplayer is the best part, and others argue the gameplay is incredibly fun. While I agree with these proponents, the monsters really make the game for me.

I made this decision after fighting Tigrex for the first time.

The biggest thing that I love about the monsters are their personalities. Everything from their nuances to their terrifying roars makes me fall in love with the hunt. 

The Qurupeco seems harmless and even charming, but the first time you experience the loud, explosive power of his flints, your heart starts rushing with fear and excitement, especially when you manage to roll away at the last second.

The Barroth is the first real intimidating monster, as he is the first monster that really roars. The moment your speakers roar at you and your hunter flinches, you know you're in for a real fight. His mindless charging and endless mud flinging really emphasizes the character of brute wyverns.

The Aoshira/Azuros is endearing in his actions. He's just a honey-loving bear that's just wandering around, and you, the hunter, invade his sunny, peaceful day. What really drives in this feeling is his limping escape. He desperately looks behind to see if you're following him. I feel so bad every time I kill him :(

On the other hand, I vehemently hate the Gigginox. All of its attacks, actions, and motions are inherently inhuman, and I hate it. The alien-like behavior of this monster disgusts me, especially its egg sac laying, eugh. I feel so proud to remove this parasite from the world.

The Nargacuga is an impressive combination of serpent, wyvern, and cougar. Every motion is calculated and lightning quick. Its tail waves around like a combination of a cat's tail and a snake. If you don't know what you are doing, the Narga really will bat you around, and he seems like he's merely toying with you. The most impressive thing about him, however, is his scream. The mix of a roar and a howling scream along with blazing red eyes, you know this kitty dragon means business.

The Tigrex. My god. I've seen streams of people hunting DevilJho, and I thought that monster was crazy with his constant, wild attacks. But the Tigrex really exudes a sense of insanity. His gaping maw is always rushing towards you, and he seems so stomach driven. When he enters rage mode though, shit really hits the fan. His roars *physically damage you*. I couldn't get over that. Plus, when he's in rage mode, he's rampaging all over the area snapping, spinning, crushing, scrabbling, and smashing at light speed. Honestly, it was so scary and intriguing that this monster really wanted you to disappear.

I honestly cannot wait to experience the next monsters lying in wait for me. I love seeing the rich ecology that MH puts out, and I hope that this game will always provide those moments where you have intimate experiences with each monster.

We tried fighting the Qurpeco(sorry if I completely mispelled that), but we lost twice (god damn thing summons dragon friends, though we were able to down the Azuros).

What should new players be focusing on accomplishing when they start the game?  Are there specific items, weapons, armors, we should be going for?  Specific bosses we should be attempting to farm?

[This thread by supersonic159](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/19l95j/can_we_decide_on_a_reddit_group_of_gates_to_use/) got me thinking about an idea I originally had two years ago with the release of Monster Hunter Tri. I'll lay out the vision for you, and then the ideas:

Vision: You sit down to play some MH3U. You could play some delicious single player, or hop online and play on the gathering hall. But who do you play with? Sure, you have some friends you can phone up and get them online, but what about those times when you don't know anyone online? A while ago, I tried to organize a couple gates specifically for reddit users to check first, see if anyone is there, and then move on if no one was online. But the post got lost in reddit obscurity, as is the nature of things. Here's what I want to do: a website that you can go to that has a graphical representation of all the gates on Monster Hunter. You log in with your hunter name, and navigate to a specific gate, both in-game and in-browser. You can see, at a glance, if anyone else has logged into this website. When you've entered a specific gate in-browser, the website acts as a chat room, and you can talk to the other hunters without having to do it through the game itself. This website would easily be linked on the subreddit, and (ideally), we would all use it and always have an easy way to find each other. 

This is a fundamentally different system than posting on this subreddit or /r/MonsterHunterMeetup. Posting to the subreddit means your competing for views like anyone else, and it doesn't provide any of the nifty communication bonuses my idea has. You make a post, get some responses, and then you have to figure out how to communicate further to meet up, both where and when.

This idea means you can see, right this second, who is in every gate on the website, and you can join that ""chat room"" at any time. Starting it here on reddit, and linking it here, means this is an easy way to join hunts with other redditors.

Implementation: My first idea was hosting a website via Amazon Web Services. I would personally pay for the hosting, as it's not very expensive. I'm flexible on the actual web hosting website, but the cheaper the better. Another option presented by my roommate is a Vent/Mumble server. It's possible to pay for an always-on Vent server, and this would operate in the same manner, but also allowing voice communication. The only problem i see is the need for a separate program, and sharing of IP's and ports, etc etc.

I would love anyone's input on this idea!! I especially would like to hear from anyone with any sort of website building experience, or coding experience, that could help bring this idea to reality. idk if a html based system would work, or java, or something else. That why I need some input!

Thanks for reading everyone!

edit: more feature ideas: WTB/WTS board, local hunter meetup for 3DS players, ""bounty board"" for organizing specific hunts, regardless of gate location

Edit: I need people with experience creating websites. I think it should be HTML5 based so it's mobile-friendly. Any takers?",,False,self,t5_2rron,1362410659.0,,SAU,True,t3_19m2kw,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/19m2kw/i_want_to_form_the_reddit_hunting_club/,moderator

If you're new, you're likely doing them wrong.",zeohi,91,13,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1bc0bh/psa_skills_if_youre_new_youre_likely_doing_them/,"Hey guys. I'm HR30 and I've played for 120 hours of 3U at this point. Yet still in G-Rank lobbies I'm seeing people with mismatched sets, with their only active skill being autoguard +10. Usually 2 people out of a 4 person lobby simply have the skills on the set they are wearing. So I figure maybe it'd be good to explain the system.

Basically, you'll notice that on your armor it has various skillpoints. I don't have exact numbers but for example, say, the jaggi chestpiece can have 3 attack on it. You'll notice you'll get charms with skills on it like +7teamleader -1 sharpness or something. 

These skillpoints are 100% worthless and do absolutely nothing for you.
The way it works is that you need to accumulate 10 of the skillpoint in order to activate the skill. For instance, 10 Sharpener skill points will activate Speed Sharpening, allowing your weapon to be sharpened in 1 carve instead of 4. 

So every set of gear will have various skillpoints and often times you will need to wear the entire set to get all the skillpoints. Most sets come with a downside. If your downside is -10 skillpoints in health, all you need is to find a way to put +1 health on your armor. -9 skillpoints in health renders this downside effectively useless.

So, look at your gears skills and see what you can fit on it. It's terrible to see people in Brachydios gear using Evasion Down when its so easy circumventable. You can do a lot of things with charms and decorations like add HG earplugs (makes you immune to all roars) or Handicraft (increases your weapons sharpness considerably, often times bringing you to the next tier of sharpness). Use this system thats there to help you!",,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,SAU,True,t3_1bc0bh,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1bc0bh/psa_skills_if_youre_new_youre_likely_doing_them/,

You are told at the start by the Village Elder that you bear the mark of a hunter, destined to honourably defend the land's few provinces from monsters.

Instead of the guild, the village elder issues you with quests. Here's where it gets interesting, since this is set way before other MH games the monsters you'd fight would be much different.

**Monster Ideas**

* The monster that Arzuros, Volvidon and Lagombi evolved from.
* Monsters would return from other games, explanation being that they never needed to evolve.
* Colossal, T-Rex like raptorial wyverns that monsters such as the Great Jaggi evolved from.
* Leviathans that previously lived on land.
* Juvenile elder dragons.
* Monster species that have long since died out.

These are just a few ideas of the multitude that are available if capcom went down this route. 

Ecology and how monsters interact is one of my favourite parts of Monster Hunter, and I think evolution plays a big part in that.

So what about it? Would you play a MH Prequel? If so, what monsters do you think would be cool in Monster Hunter pre-history?",,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,HAMMER,True,t3_1ggb3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ggb3h/would_anyone_here_play_a_mh_prequel/,

I played the JP version and didnt feel like grinding again. 

low and behold, MH3U releases and i buy a 3ds :P

anyways, im not a spry young hunter anymore. my digits are tightening and my vision isnt as it used to be but that only makes me MORE dangerous! every cut is intentional, every hammer blow is calculated. each resource is not wasted. time is limited so i need to make everything count.

im at 9 hours and steam roll my way with leather armor through 4* quests upgrading my War Hammer as i go. I did the bullfango quest to unlock the gunlance since i felt my reaction time isnt what it used to be. 

V3rgil (my avatar) awakens... puts on his now alloy armor which is heavy for his sore back.

after some bread and milk (seriously?) i began the Lagi repel quest. im slightly concerned that this old hunter wont be able to keep up with the youngin's. his armor is old, he has a few screws loose but he is there for his village. cha cha begins with a dance, as i check my inventory box for some meat and a potion. 

after getting lost in the moga woods (purely intentional...) i come up behind the lagi to start the fight. my chacha charges fight for lagi... into an electric blast flying past me. (thank you buddy for your valiant sacrifice) i begin the fight with a paintball to his bead eyes. my arms have not failed me yet. 

poke, poke dodge... poke fireblast dodge. upstab, upstab fireblast. reload.......

get the hell away from me vprey... i dont have time for your shennanigans... oh and thanks for tanking that electric blast... that will show you. go back and sniff some Laggia behind.

my grip is tightening and i can feel the arthritis in my hands grip the 3ds as V3rgil stabs at Lagis tail. poke, poke dodge, tail is down. 

oh no, cha cha is hurt. i lay a pitfall since i want to make sure i lay the hurt on him. my eyes are starting to weaken (i wake up at 5am and im still groggy). 

im reloading and notice he is going to body slam, i quickly block with my shield and WHAM.... he is struggling like a rathalos who had a little too much Apanoth. 

up stab, poke fire blast, fireblast.... stab... stab... fireblast... FIREBLAST!

Victory fanfare plays in my mind...Objective Compelted (in 9 minutes)

with a smirk, i carve my victory tail (which turned out to be a tail) and save my game as my hunter retire to bed. my train stop is here. 

V3rgil retires his lance for he knows, the next stop is rathian....

and its hammer time.

PS- just wanted to post this for all us older hunters out there. may your weapons never dull and may the desire sensor ever be in your favor. my late fathers bday is tomorrow. he was a former Korean war vet and since wasnt crazy enough to go into the serivce i expressed my inner warrior through martial arts and games which is something that he always supported. he bought me my first game system and was there as a rose the ranks.

he will always be missed. 

this is for you dad. 

slay on my brothers

Sword &amp; Shield: Hellnox Epee (Dirty Graf is a hilariously overkill alternative if you want to run Awaken)

Dual Swords: Grimmest Noxwings

Greatsword: Brünnhilde (Lordly Deathclap will inflict Poison on pretty much every hit, but the trade-off from the raw isn't worth it)

Lance: Luinox the Thirst

Gunlance: Shining Ishtar

Switch-Axe: Mizar's Asterism with Awaken (Azure Rosebloom without, although the lack of Power Phial hurts a lot)

1363022001.0,70,self.MonsterHunter,1a3aq9,Charm Tables - A PSA to hunters who want decent charms,Zombiedelight,83,13,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1a3aq9/charm_tables_a_psa_to_hunters_who_want_decent/,"There has been some controversy among the different MH communities about this issue, but it's recently been confirmed to be ""in"" for the US, so please hear me out:

**Charm Tables**

The way Charm Tables work, as a quick rundown, is that the game chooses a table, and when you get a charm it chooses the charm from that table.  In past MH entries the table has changed each play session, so players would not be 'locked' into a specific table.  In MH3G/3U the charm tables are selected at the time of your character creation and can not be changed.  

**Cursed Tables**

There are 17 Charm tables in the game.  Most have ~21,000 charm options with a variety of skills.  While some are seen as 'better' than others for different purposes most are generally pretty good (Particularly 10).  

However there are 5 'cursed' tables.  These tables have only 200-800 charms, which makes the charms you actually get selected from a very small pool.  For the 200 charm table you will be getting the same red talismans over and over due to the pool being only around 40 total.  

In addition to that, the 5 cursed tables are not only smaller, but they have crappier skills on them.  Some don't have any decent 3 slot charms available or are limited to blank 3 slot charms.  

**Charm Table Utility**

There is a good utility to take a look at the charm tables.  The data in it is translated from the Japanese data which I believe was datamined.  Athena made it and it works quite well:  http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6766-athenas-charm-table-search-for-monster-hunter-3g-monster-hunter-3u/

**Capcom Confirmation**

There had been some speculation that this won't be part of 3U, even though it was part of 3G, but today it was confirmed that the code will be the same as in 3G and that characters will indeed be locked into one table.  Yuri made the post in the Capcom Unity forums here:  http://www.capcom-unity.com/monster_hunter/go/thread/view/7451/29805389/athenas-mh3gu-charm-table-search-v032b?pg=3 

**Method for determining your Table** 

There seem to be 2 ways to see what table you are in, and potentially one way to determine what table you end up in at character creation.  

To determine which table you are on you can either enter each talisman you find into the previously mentioned utility to determine which table you are on (may take several charms) or there is also a boat method that involves sending the fishing boat to the shallow waters a few times to analyze the results using another utility to tell which table you are on.  

To attempt 'selecting' your charm table from the start, you can create your character at certain 'times'.  This involves setting your Wii U or 3DS system time to certain times and clicking yes to create a new character in a specific (generally 3 second) window.  

Here are the following times:  

Time and date when the other aimed at the table is ""2012/1/21"" for all.  T1 = Table 1, etc. 00:14:11~13 means 00 hours (midnight), 14 minutes, and between 11 and 13 seconds.  Added strikethrough for the 5 'cursed' tables, so people didn't think they should aim for them.  

Also worth noting that wireless should be shut off, otherwise I think the system may update the type itself.  (regardless the jp guides say to turn the wireless off).  

T1 00:14:11 ~ 13 

T2 02:14:39 ~ 42 

T3 00:11:28 ~ 30 

T4 00:05:47 ~ 49 

T5 00:56:43 ~ 45 

T6 00:42:17 ~ 20 

T7 01:43:58 ~ 01 

T8 09:25:48 ~ 51 

T9 07:09:58 ~ 01 

T10 00:14:43 ~ 45 

T13 00:07:46 ~ 48 

T14 00:17:02 ~ 05 

~~T11 00:02:43~~

~~T12 00:06:41~~

~~T15 00:08:09~~

~~T16 00:13:22~~

~~T17 00:20:03~~


Some people may not care, but for others who want options in charms it's worth looking into.  Even if you think you don't care, it's probably worth checking out so you can see what you may potentially be getting yourself into or foregoing.

**[JAPAN RELEASE DATE]**

**14th of September, 2013**

We have no news on the estimate US release time as of now. The demo for the Japanese version is *not* out yet either.

It will cost 5,705 yen, and apparently comes alone, or with in a limited edition 3DSLL package.

There's a Black Gore Magara Black, and a Felyne White package. Details on this package will be released soon on the MH4 homepage.

**[TSUJIMOTO SPEECH TRANSLATIONS]**

Here, I will be effectively trying to translate what he's saying line for line. Hopefully that makes it easier to understand the broadcast.

Starting from 7:50...

To all those watching the Nintendo Direct, this is Capcom's Tsujimoto. Today I would like to deliver the new information on ""Monster Hunter 4"" *directly* (Game Start SFX) to you.

Since its announcement in 2011, it has been a long wait, but first, I'd like to announce the release date for MH4.

The release date for MH4 is the 14th of September, 2013. Also, there will be two special limited edition 3DSes released with the game. Please refer to the MH4 homepage for further details at a later point in time.

Now, we have received overwhelming feedback from all our players with regards to the ""Monster Hunter"" series. Many aspects of the hunt have evolved in the new ""MH4"", and players will be able to enjoy a kind of ""hunting action"" they have never experienced before.

Although many of you have already heard this information, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce these new aspects of the game to new players too.

First up is the core feature of MH4: ""Elevated Action"". Hunters will be able to attack by jumping off elevated terrain, and execute jumping and mounting attacks.

Wyverns from previous series will make an appearance too, including Yian Kut-Ku, Khezu, and Congalala. They will also have new attacks based on the ""Elevated Action"" mechanic, so it will be something to look forward to.

Of course, there are many new monsters too, such as the Gore Magara, Gararaajara, and the Tetsukabura, in addition to many other new monsters.

Weapon action has evolved too, and all 12 weapons featured in past MH games will be usable in MH4. All weapons have also gained elevation attacks, so please look forward to it!

In MH4, two new weapons feature as well, the Insect Master's Rod, able to utilize the ""Hunting Bug"" to buff themselves, as well as make use of the vaulting attack to initiate jump/mount attacks on a monster. The other weapon is the Charge Axe, a ""combination"" weapon consisting of a sword and a shield. There are still many things I cannot speak about in the Charge Axe, but there will be a hands-on session on the 1st and 2nd of June, in Tokyo, Yodaiba's Aqua City. More will be revealed there!

Of course, multiplayer communications is important to us. Although we have elaborated on this in our past announcements, today I'd like to make another announcement with regards to MH4's onine play feature. It will be internet multiplay compatible, and this function will be completely free.

We will be announcing more about these online functions at later dates, so please wait patiently for that info!

(The screen then cuts to a celebrity who is making an advertisement for the game. I will not be translating this part.)

This will be all for today's announcements. Please enjoy this information-packed trailer! It is also available for download on the 3DS Nintendo E-shop (Japan only I think).

Thank you for watching today's Nintendo Direct!

1363723879.0,71,self.MonsterHunter,1am4le,Charm Table Manipulation - A Comprehensive Guide / How To,Zombiedelight,74,3,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1am4le/charm_table_manipulation_a_comprehensive_guide/,"Hi Everyone, 

I'm posting this as a follow up to my previous thread on Charm Tables.  In order to maybe present the process in a more coherent and comprehensive way.  This is to include not only how to try for the charm table you want, but also for how to confirm you got the correct table.  [Most of the information is duplicative of this thread on club1kjho which is a wonderful resource particularly for the basic content of the charm tables.](http://www.club1kjho.com/t313-everything-about-charm-tables).   

Just to reiterate the locked tables were confirmed by capcom, and various people have confirmed the ability to choose the charm tables using the system time.  

**Choosing a Charm Table**

This is largely up to personal preference.  Visit the link above to get some idea, or just go with Table 10 for blademasters like most other people are doing.  If you want more detailed charm table information, check [Athena's program which has searchable info that allows you to look at specific charm combinations and which table they are available on.](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6766-athenas-charm-table-search-for-monster-hunter-3g-monster-hunter-3u/).  

**Getting the Desired Charm Table**

Getting into the right table is a fairly intricate process with little room for error.  The charm table is dependent on the time you make your character at.  We don't know the exact formula for the timing, but we do have 1 'time' confirmed for each table.  If you start a new game on a time / date that ISN'T on the list below, the game will assign a charm table based on the time / date you created.  This will be the case even if you miss the window by 1 second.  It may still be on a ""good"" table but it likely won't be the table you are looking for.  

0. Make sure your game is updated so there are no unexpected delays in starting your new game.  Start the game, then quit out of it just to make sure. 

1. Turn off the system WiFi - To do this, on the Wii U go to the ""settings"" (the wrench icon on the gamepad) and it should be one of the options at the bottom.  Don't know about the 3DS process for turning off WiFi because I don't have one. 

2. Change the system date and time - *Have a stop watch ready!* Changing the system date and time is fairly easy under the date and time setting.  Change the date to 1/21/2012, then hit next.  This will bring up the time.  Find the time you want from the following list and set the time at least two minutes before the time you want.  As soon as you confirm the time, start your stop watch.  

3. Exit the system configuration after setting the time and starting the stop watch and Start MH3U.  Once in 3U, wait until your stop watch reads the correct time in seconds to put your system clock at the time for the table you want.  As soon as it is within that small 3 second window select **NEW GAME**.  This is the 'trigger point' for when it chooses a table for you.  At this point you are ""done"" in trying to get the correct table.  

**All times are AM, not PM.  Selecting PM instead of AM will cause the process to fail** 
The time format is Hours:Minutes:Seconds ~ Seconds.  You have a roughly 3 second window for every table.  The Strikethrough times are the 'cursed' tables which most people would avoid.  

T1 12:14:11 ~ 13

T2 02:14:39 ~ 42

T3 12:11:28 ~ 30

T4 12:05:47 ~ 49

T5 12:56:43 ~ 45

T6 12:42:17 ~ 20

T7 01:43:58 ~ 01

T8 09:25:48 ~ 51

T9 07:09:58 ~ 01

T10 12:14:43 ~ 45

T13 12:07:46 ~ 48

T14 12:17:02 ~ 05

~~T11 12:02:43~~

~~T12 12:06:41~~

~~T15 12:08:09~~

~~T16 12:13:22~~

~~T17 12:20:03~~



**Example** 

For someone who wants Table 10, they would set the time to 12:12 AM and press start on the stop watch as soon as they confirm the time.  This is 2 minutes an 43 ~ 45 seconds away from the Table 10 timing.  They would exit out of the system config and start MH3U.  As soon as the stopwatch reaches 2 minutes and 43 seconds, the player would press ""new game.""  And that's it.  

**Checking / Confirming Your Table** 

There are two ways to check which table you got on.  The ""fishing boat"" method.  Or the ""mining/charm"" method.  

*Fishing Boat Method*

First, the easiest and fastest method is to use the fishing boat method.  To do so, rush to get the first fishing boat (you get it after you do the ""guts"" quest which has you spear some water creatures and carve them for their guts).  Once you get the first fishing boat, send it out to Moga Coast (One Star).  Take note of your catch and enter it into [This Site](http://mhvuze.de/3ucharm/fishEN/) *Note the site may be down or slow from too many people trying to use it at the same time due to so many people trying to do this during launch*.  This should return a page, in japanese, which will indicate which table you are on.  This method can be done in about 40 minutes with the proper quest order.  

*Mining / Charm Method*

The Charm method is more straight forward but can take much longer to narrow it down.  You need to first get a decent number of Talismans, then essentially check them against what tables they show up in.  Some charms, particularly the lowest level, are duplicated among many tables, so getting charms which only appear on a few tables can take some time.  This method obviously takes much longer and should probably only be used if you have already invested a good chunk of time in the game.  

You can either check them using [Athenas Table Program](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6766-athenas-charm-table-search-for-monster-hunter-3g-monster-hunter-3u/) or [with this Japanese website / utility (it may require japanese proficiency to use properly)](http://mh.websimu.mydns.jp/3g_oma/xxx/table.php)

Today is the final day that Tri servers are on, and I did not regret one minute of it.

I was on an event quest server, the only events now being the Jhen quests regulated by the servers. The other events were stopped long ago. I was joined by three strangers who I had never met before, but we had all come with the same purpose; to get our last last hurrah's with the online service before the plug gets pulled forever. We fought Jhen twice and one Alatreon, all successful on the first try and with no deaths. We got the items that we knew we could not access anymore after today and wished each other the best. Today was a series of hunts I shall not forget, and I'm truly upset to see Tri go down.

""May the winds of success blow on your wings."" was among our parts words. We didn't bother with friend requests, only the hope that we could somehow bump into each other in Ultimate. 

Rest in peace, Monster Hunter Tri. We had a great run. You were far from the best games in the series, but you gave us a decent online system, allowing partnerships and communication that people like me could not achieve with a PSP. Tri may be lacking among the others, but the memories are certainly unique.

I've received many requests to establish a ""default"" reddit server and lobby that we can all go to and find each other. This would remove a little of the discomfort that comes from joining random people, and having random people join you. I was hesitant at first to do this, as I tried the exact same thing for Monster Hunter Tri, with little success. But our community is much larger and stronger than it was back in those days, so lets give it another shot!

So, if you would like to play with other redditors, by either finding some already playing or creating a room in the hopes that others will join, please create your room, or search for one, in:

Free Play 2, Lobby 8!

I recommend titling the room something distinctive, such as /r/mh, so that we can identify it immediately. Also, if you wish to put a password on these rooms to discourage random people from joining, please make the password ""rmh"", and hopefully this will become a norm that we all follow. I'll put this info on the sidebar when I'm at an actual computer instead of AlienBlue ;)

On another note, I've been contacted by the folks at Club Teamwork with regards to the IRC that we established for the subreddit. One of the things I wanted to do with this IRC was for it to be general enough that anyone could join without feeling immediately alienated by the name of the channel. Hence, the channel was simply named ##MonsterHunter, as opposed to ##MHReddit or something along those lines. Anyways, Club Teamwork wishes to use our chat room as the destination for their users when they choose to chat on their website! 

I believe this is fantastic news. The IRC has been very active since it was implemented, and many hunts have been spontaneously formed on it. The IRC also makes it very easy for anyone to create a separate chat room on the fly, so people can join up on the IRC, and then create another chat room for their hunt specifically. The addition of users from Club Teamwork will expand the user base, providing everyone who uses it with more potential hunting partners, and a whole new source of knowledge for fledgling hunters who have questions!

Please let me know if anyone has any questions about any of this!",,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,SAU,True,t3_1b6gl6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1b6gl6/default_reddit_server_and_lobby_in_mh3u_and/,moderator

Rewards with low rank armor spheres, Vouchers, and another event quest exclusive - the Exquisite Meat. Turning in Exquisite Meat x2,  Gobul Whisker x2, and Frog x5 to Junior in the offline village rewards you with the Kebab-boo Mask for your Shakalaka companions. This mask is shaped like a large piece of meat, and seems to make your companion lure large monsters to traps. The only possibly difficult aspect of this quest is the Rathian that may spawn and chase you down when you're carrying an egg.

**Colorful Beasts** *(Requires HR3)* -
Hunt 3 Large Monsters (Nargacuga, Rathalos, and Zinogre) in the Deserted Island. Rewards you with materials per monster, and the event exclusive Top Secret Formula material used to craft the [Sinister Saints](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Sinister_Saints) Switch Axe. This weapon has been changed a bit since its appearance in Tri, it requires Top Secret Formula x5 (From the event quest,) Narga Razor x3 (From High Rank Body Carves and Wing breaks,) and Wyvern Stone x4 (From a variety of High Rank large monsters.) In MH3U, this SA was upgraded to 920 Raw, and now has 920 Raw, 3 Sockets, and decently high blue sharpness. (This quest also has a roaming Brachydios, so bring them Dung Bombs!)

**Gigginox Buffet** *(Requires HR3)* -
Hunt 2 or more Gigginox in the Tundra, and deliver the Pass Ticket to end the quest. As of now I am unaware if there is a limit to how many Giggi you can kill over the entire quest, but a minimum of two are required to clear it. This quest's unique reward is the Lion's Claw, which is used to craft the greatsword [**Lion's Bane**](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100206174743/monsterhunter/images/thumb/c/c9/LionsBane.png/300px-LionsBane.png) (Attack: 1008, Attribute: (Awakening: Dragon 200), Sharpness: Blue (Sharpness+1: White), Affinity: 0%, Slots: 2, Rare 6)

So, I figured I'd share them with you, too! Oh, and they're not just generic links to the MH Wiki and stuff. All specific things. :D Share your favorites in the comments!

**[Weapon Trees](http://www.kiranico.com/weapon/) and [Item Search](http://www.kiranico.com/item/) - [Kiranico.com](http://www.kiranico.com/)**

The Weapon trees are in text form, have good, simple layout options, and you can show/hide the Sharpness+1/Load Up info. Also has buttons for ""upgrade"" vs ""build"" materials on the specific items.

**[Carve/Drop Guide - GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/wii-u/683294-monster-hunter-3-ultimate/faqs/66820)**

Not example complete, but thorough and has most. Missing things like Jhen and Dire Miralis.

**[Port Tanzia Quest List - Monster Hunter Wikia](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/MH3U:_Guild_Quests)**

**[Moga Village Quest List - Monster Hunter Wikia](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/MH3U:_Village_Quests)**

Great for ranking up and knowing which are the important key quests. Also good for a quick ""WHICH TIER HAS WHAT HUNT"" check.

**[Armor Skill List - Monster Hunter Wikia](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/MH3U:_Armor_Skill_List)**

Almost completely accurate armor skill list so you know which does what. I tend to confuse Capture Expert and Capture Guru, for example. (Transporter and Ranger skills are swapped in descriptions)

**[Monster Info Chart Image - Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Lg0Rf0m.png)**

Elemental weaknesses, weakspots for damage, and other info for most of the monsters in the game. A bit of a small image for the amount of info, but works.

**[Athena's Armor Set Search tool - Minegarde Forums](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/5304-athenas-armor-set-search-for-mh3g-and-mh3u/)**

If you don't know Athena's Armor tools yet, you should! Build your list of talismans in the program and then build sets of armor that you can potentially make! Basically, you set the skills you're looking for in a single set, and it tells you if it's at all possible and then how to build it. It's fabulous, though not necessarily fashionable. (Yes, you have to download it. Yes, it's safe.)

And that's my main list! I'm hoping both [MHPedia](http://www.mhpedia.com/) and the [""Monster Hunter Wiki""](http://www.mh3-ultimate.com/) get updated/translated so we can combine some more of the information in a cleaner manner.

So for me MH3U has been a fairly straight forward progression, I am over 130 hours now and I was making my way through the first round of G rank quests (I play 90% offline so I solo almost everything).  I hit no major walls, when I graduated from LR to HR to G there was a mild painful period where my armor and weapons were subpar but nothing too harsh.

Then I came to G Rank Green Plessy... ah Plessy how I hate thee.  In every game that she has been present I avoided her, back in the day it was because she was a very drawn out fight due to retreating into the water where I could not reach her.  She is infamous for her ridiculous hip check, and that tail that seems to grow every time she turns.  I failed on her 7 times, when the most I failed any quest up until now was twice (and that was because I stupidly went straight to the P. Rathian when I graduated to G rank).

So why do I love her?  Because she made me try, I had fought the other monsters so many times I had their patterns and distances memorized without even trying.  I had no walls, just straight progression and farming for drops.  Plessy made me actively think about distances again and actively looking to read her tells again.  I gripped my controller so tight this morning when I saw her limping, and felt amazing when I capped her. 

I have no intention of farming her, and I will continue to avoid her, but I really enjoy having a monster out there that still makes me try after all these years.",,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,,True,t3_1e2rkk,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1e2rkk/why_i_hate_and_love_plesioth/,

Some of them are collected from you guys, and a few are my own. Feel free to take credit if you were the one who originally posted it, and defiantly post more here.

* As tempting as it might be for those of you spoiled by Tanzia hunts, don't neglect Moga village. The best hunters make use of fully upgraded farms for honey and cashflow, and you'll get better at the game when you're forced to solo monsters.

* Bouncebombs act like torpedoes underwater and are useful for attacking monsters at long range.

* Granny Go-To sells hot peppers and sleepyfish which when combined make energy drinks which act like rations. This is easier than farming/cooking raw meat and faster to eat.

* Nibbelsnarf has an absurd number of exploitable weaknesses. When he's submerged, a well timed sonic bomb will force him to surface and stun him. When he's charging with his mouth agape, he'll swallow large barrel bombs and be stunned from the explosion. When he's stunned with his upper body sticking out of the ground, you can fish him out by putting away your weapon and pressing A next to him making him even more vulnerable.

* Monsters that are submerged beneath sand are forced to surface when sonic bombs are thrown at them.

* Tanzia Chips replenish your red health bar making them useful when going up against poisonous monsters.

* When you kill a monster, you can skip the victory cutscene by pressing (skip) on your touchscreen, or by opening 
and closing your start menu.

* Tanzian Ale and Hairy tuna have Felyne Explorer as a fixed skill. This way, you'll end up in secret unreachable 
areas in high rank and G rank quests for some rare gathering. (Won't work in paw pass quests)

* Crouching increases gathering/carving speed. Useful for picking up ballista ammo.

* When knocked over, Uragaan can be mined for lava nuggets. (on his back or legs) Lava nuggets can be given to 
Junior (The chief's son) for 1500 resource points a pop.

* 3DS users can go into the title screen's option menu and turn off the 3D. This will give you a framerate boost thats higher than just turning the 3D slider off.

* While combining a large stack of items, hold down the A button.

* Quests labeled [Canteen] will give you access better food before quests.

* For lancers: holding your shield up stops your stamina regeneration. But holding your shield up while walking does NOT. This can be used to quickly regenerate stamina while defending against relentless monster attacks. (But don't take this as justification for turtling)

* Nulberries should be your primary source of income when money is tight. A fully upgraded farm using fertilizer that is cultivating nulberries can yield tens of thousands of zenny at a time. It costs 200 resource points for 10 cycles with dung. You can get free dung from an aptonoth in Tanzia port marina, or buy it in bulk from Granny Go-To.

* Hoard everything unless it specifically says ""Sell this item"" in the description.

* If you're unsure about what element to use against a monster, talk to the blacksmith and see what weaknesses/resistances that specific monster's armor gives you.

* Using a shield bash on a kelbi yields different carves than KOing one with a normal attack.

* Crag Bowguns, Blast Bows, Hammers, Greatswords, and Switchaxes, are pvp accident prone. Communicate with your team and make sure you know where to aim. Attacking at random and knocking people around is a good way to alienate other players and getting someone killed because of it is just terrible of you.

* Ask questions. The Monster Hunter online community is more often than not, very friendly and helpful.

[**My gear is shown in the pictures.**](http://imgur.com/a/wrHv7)

For those that aren't familiar with those particular armor skills I'll give some explanation:

The skills ""Unshakable"" and ""Edge Master"" are very powerful skills that are only normally found on end game sets of armor and never on the same complete set. I was able to get them both on one set of armor and also complement it with the ""Evasion +1"" skill to boot!

The ""Unshakable"" skill gives:

* Reduced effects from knockdowns
* Wind Resist (Lo)
* Earplugs (Lo)
* Current Resist (Lo)

*It's important to note that the resistance skills that Unshakable gives are actually better than the normal (Lo) skill, but not quite as good the the (HG) versions of the respective skills.*

The ""Edge Master"" skill gives:

* Attack Up (L)
* Sharpness +1

And then there is:

* Evasion +1, pretty strait forward.

I also want to say that I am getting the following skills from the songs on my Hunting Horn:

* Mind's Eye
* Affinity 25%
* HG Earplugs


I feel like I have the perfect combo of Defensive and Offensive skills as well as minimizing the downtime I take from getting hit by having the knockdown reduction and Evasion +1. Another large reason is a like the play style of having those skills and how it makes the game feel faster.

And with all that I am SO excited to have this set that I wanted to show off my crowning MH3U achievement!

I was thinking it would be possible to make a much slimmer, less bloated site, specifically made for the 3DS's browser.

I'd just like to get peoples thoughts on this idea. Is there already a site like this?

Also, I'd like to recruit people to do it because while I have the ability, I don't have the time to make a new website - at least not until summer.

I'm also going to message the monster hunter wiki's admins and see if wikia.com has some sort of pre-built mobile layout that they could enable

Update: Not contacted the mh wikia admins yet but I found that wikia has a mobile version. I've already forgotten how to access it but it's irrelevant. I tested it on the 3DS and it wasn't any better.

You follow them, you will survive the hunt. Fail to obey orders, you are going to have a bad time to say the least.

* **Rule #1** Do not want what you need.
* **Rule #2** DO NOT WANT WHAT YOU NEED.
* **Rule #3** Cooking/mining/fishing/gathering is very important. That is why you get paid to do it.
* **Rule #3.5** Feel free to specialize, but learn to use ALL classes of weapons efficiently.
* **Rule #3.6** Following Rule #3.5, know what weapon (and element/status effect) is most effective against each new monster. Also, raw damage is better elemental in most case.
* **Rule #4** Learn how to use ""The Claw.""
* **Rule #5** Do not fear the beasts, respect them.
* **Rule #6** Before actually taking sword to hide, allow it to demonstrate its abilities. Study it.
* **Rule #7** Don't get hit, hit it 'till it dies.
* **Rule #8** Don't ignore Rule #7.
* **Rule #9** DON'T BE GREEDY. This is very important and I see too many a hunter slain because they do not follow this rule. If you only have enough time to hit once, hit only once!
* **Rule #10** Judge not a Hunter by his rank.
* **Rule #11** Did it just go super sayain? Perhaps you should wait until it has calmed down..
* **Rule #12** You do not have time to carve that tail. ...Hey I said leave it! (Hunter2 has fallen unconscious). Goddammit... (Reward has fallen to 0z. Quest failed).
* **Rule #13** Always carry a surplus of whetstone, sharpen often. A dull blade pierces no hide.
* **Rule #14** Refine your inner alchemist. It's all you have left when you run out of potions.
* **Rule #15** Taking out smaller monsters now will save you future scars.
* **Rule #16** Guide the blade of hunters in need. They might save your hide one day. (Most likely the same day).
* **Rule #17** Make sure you have ALL of the needed suplies BEFORE embarking.
* **Rule #18** If you can't find the time to heal, leave the area. Please.

As mentioned I'll be translating MH4 info, obtained from the latest issue of Dengeki Nintendo. 

Please refer to the [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1f0mxa/interest_check_mh4_translation_do_you_guys_want_it/) for more information on this project.

As much as I do not want to split this up, as translation goes on walls of text will be generated - as such I figured I might as well do this to prepare for future splits.

I'll be including a sub-contents page in case people are confused. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.

 [Charge Axe Page 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8824823962/) |

*Charge Axe! One of the two brand-new MH4 Weapons!*

*PS: Both the Charge Axes in these images are in AXE MODE! When in ""Sword"" Mode, it's literally like a gigantic Sword-and-Shield. Zoom in on Page 2, you'll see.*

**[SWORD MODE]**

- The Charge Axe (not slash axe), is a new weapon in MH4 with a ""Sword-Shield"" mode, and a destructive ""Axe"" mode. 

&gt; - When in ""Sword-Shield"" mode, it functions similar to the standard SnS. Its movement speeds and guard ability are comparable to the SnS as well.
&gt; - Evasion during SnS form can be done in the form of rolling and sidestepping.


**[THE CHARGE SYSTEM]**

- The Charge Axe incorporates a ""Charging mechanism"" into its systems. 
&gt; - The Charge meter is a visible meter with 5 ""Canister"" Icons on it.
&gt; - The Charge Axe can only be charged in Sword Mode. The Charged Canisters are expended by Axe Mode attacks.
&gt; - There are two glow colours, red and yellow.

- The ""Charge Action"" button(s) must be manually pressed when the weapon glows to charge the Canisters.
&gt; - *The Charge Action button combinations are not mentioned in the article, but may likely involve the R button as per MH tradition when it comes to reloads.*


**[OVERHEATING AND MIS-CHARGE]**

- To recap, attacking with the CA in Sword Mode will cause the hilt of the weapon to **GLOW**.

- The weapon can only be charged in Sword Mode.
&gt; - When the weapon is charged during a yellow glow, the meter gains 3 icons.
&gt; - When the weapon is charged during a red glow, the meter gains 5 icons (full charge).

- However, when the weapon is charged during without a visible glow, a **MIS-CHARGE** occurs.
&gt; - This **MIS-CHARGE** causes vulnerability frames to occur. The article officially terms it as a ""Charging Mistake"".
&gt; - Common sense indicates that this happens because there's nothing to charge into the Canisters, so the weapon derps around instead.

- Alternatively, when the Hunter attacks with the weapon after it displays a red glow...
&gt; - The weapon **OVERHEATS**.
&gt; - Overheating causes attacks to bounce when the weapon is in this state. The article does not mention if it comes with obligatory vulnerability frames or not.
&gt; - This will also cause the giant words **CHARGE** to appear on the bar, reminding you not to derp around, and actually charge the weapon.

**[AXE MODE]**

- The article states that the CA is very similar to the Greatsword in terms of movement speed and evasion. Whether this means that CA users roll or not I have no idea, but by the way it looks it does seem to be the case.

- When in ""Axe"" mode, the Hunter cannot guard, and suffers from a slow movement speed. In exchange, the weapon deals high damage in this state, and the energy stored in the Canisters can now be used for elemental slash attacks. 

- Mode-changing can be done mid-jump or immediately after a guard as a transformation attack.

- There are different kinds of ""Canisters"", much like Phials for Switch Axes. As of now there are two known Canister types.
&gt; - Strong Element Canister: Capable of generating explosions of the same element as the weapon. Explosions deal elemental damage.
&gt; - Grenade Canister: Capable of dealing KO damage to a monster, but the Axe's attacks must hit the monster's head.

- The Axe mode also has an **Elemental Slash Finisher** move, which utilizes all of the energy stored in the weapon's Canisters to unleash a heavy hitting attack. 
&gt; - This attack also amplifies the Canister's latent abilities, in addition to causing a small explosion to occur on the point of impact.
&gt; - After this attack the weapon forcibly reverts back to Sword mode, and has to be charged again before it can re-enter Axe mode.
&gt; - This seems to be a one-hit affair, unlike the Switch Axes' ""Elemental Release"" attack.

**[WEAPON ANALYSIS]**

- It has come to my attention that this weapon is complex and very different from the Slash Axe (Switch Axe to you guys I guess...) as we know it. This is something I've just realized thanks to redditor *KanaKuroko*'s question.

- As we know so far, the CA has to be made to GLOW in Sword mode first.
&gt; - This allows for the hunter to manually initiate CHARGE, which converts the **GLOW** into a **CANISTER**.
&gt; - As we know there are a total of 5 Canisters to be filled. These are used in *AXE MODE*.

- However, if you attempt to **CHARGE WITH NO GLOW**, you will enter a *long vulnerability frame sequence*.
&gt; - This can be easily likened to the Gunlance's ""NO MORE ROUNDS, FOOL!"" shaking animation when the hunter attempts to shell without a shell in the chamber.
&gt; - So far this all makes sense.

- However, if you attempt to **ATTACK WITH A RED GLOW** on the weapon in SWORD MODE, this **OVERHEATS** the Sword Mode's Charging Mechanism, and attacks bounce.
&gt; - This effectively means that, in order to use the weapon effectively, you have to constantly **CHARGE** the weapon to convert excess **ENERGY GAINED FROM ATTACKING** into a **CANISTER**.

- In simple English (do pardon my liberal use of bold letters), it simply means that *spamming attacks in Sword Mode without converting the Energy into a Canister will result in an overheat*.

- In EVEN simpler English, it means ""You cannot spam Sword Mode Attacks"". To me, this is great! It FORCES the hunter to do three things:
&gt; - Manage Sword Mode Glow Level
&gt; - Knowing monster patterns so they can effectively Charge without being hit
&gt; - Learn to alternate between Sword and Axe form efficiently.

- That's kinda awesome IMHO.

**[TLDR MODE]**

 - For Hunters who prefer to slash more and read less, here is my predicted weapon usage flowchart.

SWORD MODE &gt; ATTACK &gt; GAIN GLOW &gt; IF YELLOW GLOW &gt; ATTACK &gt; IF RED GLOW &gt; CHARGE &gt; IF CHARGE FULL &gt; AXE MODE &gt; YOLO &gt; ELEMENTAL BURST ATTACK &gt; REVERT TO SWORD MODE &gt; REPEAT &gt; PROFIT

**[7] Exclusive Coverage: Insect Master's Rod**

| [Rod 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814218351/) |
 [Rod 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814210823/) |

*The Insect Master's Rod - Hunt with the Hunting Bug! A new style of gameplay.*

- The Insect Master's Rod (Or Hunting Bug Staff if you prefer), is a new weapon in MH4 that focuses on self-buffs and jump attacks.

- The defining characteristic of this weapon is its synergy with the Hunting Bug on your hand, and its unique ability to initiate jump attacks **WITHOUT ELEVATED TERRAIN** by *vaulting*.
 &gt; - It is the only weapon in the whole game to initiate jump attacks at will.
 &gt; - It is also a weapon with high mobility and movement speed.

- This weapon is able to command the iconic ""Hunting Bug"" to attack monsters, drawing their essence out and infusing it into the hunter.

&gt; - Different monster parts apparently generate different essences.
&gt; - When a monster enters rage mode, the essences within its body changes, and so do the the buffs you gain from them.

**[INSECT CONTROL]**

- Mark monsters with Odor Rounds!

&gt; - The Insect Master's Rod can be used like a bowgun, entering sharpshooting mode to shoot Odor Rounds.
&gt; - These Odor Rounds instruct the Hunting Bug to attack the target, and hence draw out its essence.
&gt; - More importantly, the Hunter is able to aim with great precision. Eg. A monster's tail and head may give different essence buffs. By aiming and shooting the Odor Round at the appropriate part, you gain the buffs you want.

- Hunting Bug and Essences!

&gt; - The Hunting Bug is a very, very big beetle-like insect that rests on the Hunter's right arm.
&gt; - When the Hunter marks his/her target with an Odor Round, the bug flies out and attacks the target.
&gt; - When its attack connects, it gains essence. 

- Hunting Bug, Essence, and you!

&gt; - When the attack of the Hunting Bug connects and successfully draws out essence, it will display a glowing colour in its thorax. 
&gt; - This glow represents the kind of buff that the essence within it carries.
&gt; - The Hunting Bug can then be called to return to you. It is worth noting that until Mr. Bug completes its landing sequence, you do not gain access to the buffs.

- The Essence Buffs

&gt; - There are **FOUR** different kinds of essences available for use.
&gt; - **WHITE: Movement Speed Up**
&gt; - **RED: Attack Up**
&gt; - **ORANGE: Defense Up**
&gt; - **GREEN: Health Recovery**

- The Insect Master's Rod is meant to be used with the Hunting Bug in combos often. If one controls the weapon properly it is possible to remain buffed throughout the entire fight. 

&gt; - In a sense, this is similar to the Hunting Horn, but unlike the HH it is faster, and only affects the Hunter.

**[VAULTING ATTACKS]**

- By stabbing the Rod into the ground, the Hunter is able to perform an Olympic-level high vaulting jump.

- While other weapons have to make use of elevated ground to initiate jump attacks, the Insect Master's rod is the only weapon in the game to be able to do this at will.

- This vaulting jump can be used as a means of evasion, or to easily and quickly reach higher terrain. In this sense the weapon is a lot more mobile and ""Free-flowing"" than most other traditional MH weapons.

- If MH had a parkour kit this weapon would basically be it.

- The vaulting jump can also be chained into a powerful overhead downswing.

&gt; - If this downswing connects with certain parts of a monster, the hunter is able to initiate mount attack mode.

**[WEAPON ANALYSIS]**

- There's really not much to be said about the Insect Hunter's Rod at this point in time.

- What we do know states that this weapon is:

&gt; - Fast and mobile
&gt; - Able to vault over monsters, initiate jump attacks without high ground, and get to high ground easily
&gt; - Able to buff the Hunter by Hunting Bug Attacks
&gt; - Hinted to involve fast combos.

- Not much is known at this point! I will add more information as and when it becomes available.

1. Switch Axe Overview

  The Switch Axe is a fairly new weapon first seen in Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii. The function of the weapon, is that it has two modes, Axe mode and Sword mode. The weapon always starts out in Axe mode if drawn normally.
  Axe mode provides the range and attack speed of a Greatsword, without having the character weighed down while the weapon is unsheathed. There are a number of tools that give Axe mode its own place in use of the weapon, including mode-changing hits, a far reaching Upward swing (ideal for cutting tails), and chain swings. 
  Sword mode brings out the incredible damage of the Switch Axe. Most importantly, Sword mode gains automatic ESP, which means the attacks can NOT bounce off of the monsters skin, even at low sharpness. Every Switch Axe also contain ""Phials"" which are released during Sword mode. Phials are extra elements or status inducing effects that are added on to the already existing element/effect of the weapon itself. Finally, Sword mode includes a ""Sword Burst"", an attack that charges the sword up, and causes an elemental/phial explosion towards the end of the sword. The drawbacks to Sword mode, are that the player's movement is severely reduced (akin to that of an unsheathed Greatsword) and that Sword mode attacks can only be used if your Sword Gauge is more than halfway full. 

To categorize the weapon, the Switch Axe is an Offensive-based weapon. It somewhere in between a Greatsword (minus the defense) and a Longsword (minus the speed/maneuverability). The weapon difficulty is somewhere from moderate to advanced. 

2. Basic Controls

1/Triangle = Vertical Swing
2/Circle = Horizontal Swing
1+2/Triangle+Circle = Both (duh.)

To save myself the trouble of constantly getting confused with PSP to 3DS button differences, I'm just going to write out the Buttons as seen above. 1 is Vertical, 2 is Horizontal, 1+2 is both together. 

Axe Mode

Most attacks can be chained into each other, experiment and see what works for you.

1 - Unsheathe/ Downward swing

1,1 - Downward swing into Horizontal swing.

F+1 - A forward stepping thrust with the end of the axe. Hit ""R"" after this attack to combo into Sword mode. 

2 - A short horizontal swing.

1+2 - A Massive upward swing, useful for cutting tails. 

1+2, 2 (repeatedly) - After the upward swing, pressing 2 repeatedly will bring the axe into a chain swing combo. The chain swing can hit many times, but does less damage, and greatly reduces stamina with each swing. You can end the chain swing at any time with a downward swing by pressing 1. 

R - If you have more than half the sword gauge full, this will manually switch you into Sword mode. If not, pressing R will make the hunter reload the weapon, gaining you 1/3 of your Sword Gauge back. (Note: the hunter can only ""reload"" the weapon when it is less than half way full).

Sword Mode 

R + 1+2 - Unsheathe automatically to Sword mode.

1, 1 - vertical swing combo that can be repeated until you run out of Sword Gauge

2, 2 - Horizontal swing combo that can be repeated until you run out of Sword Gauge. Pressing R after the first hit returns you to Axe mode

1+2 - Beginning of Sword Burst. Burst will cancel itself if 1 is not pressed repeatedly. 

1+2, 1 (repeatedly) - Sword Burst begins to charge up. Every charging hit, does a minuscule amount of damage. Once the sword is charged up enough, the Burst will cause an explosion at the end of the sword. After Burst, the Switch Axe will always return to Axe mode, even if your Sword Gauge is above half-filled. From Charge to Burst takes about 2.5 seconds, but holding back on the analog stick while charging will cause the sword to burst earlier (0.5 - 1.5 seconds). This is to escape dangerous situations while charging Burst. Different phials affect the burst in different ways.


3. Why Switch Axe?

The Switch Axe is very versatile and can change with varying situations. Though Axe mode cannot get very many hits in trying to punish a monster, Sword mode is incredibly helpful for capitalizing on damage through staggers and traps. In multiplayer, the Switch Axe does not have a wide hit box, making it so that your teammates need not worry about getting tripped/launched through the air. The weapon is about having some levels of both damage and speed.  

 Plus, it looks awesome. 

4. Elemental vs. Raw

Although Switch Axes are the 3rd strongest weapon in terms of numerical damage, they come nowhere near being able to do without elemental damage. Near High Rank, it is expected for a hunter who uses the Switch Axe to have around 5 - 6 Axes that he/she switches between for different monsters. 
 In the long run as well, Axes with higher elemental damage (and usually sharpness) do more Damage Per Swing/Second (DPS) than Axes with lower elemental and higher raw damage. Therefore, it is important that a Switch Axe user stock up on parts to make various Switch Axes for all the monsters. The first two that should be made are Fire and Thunder. Just about every monster in the game has a weakness to either of these two elements, with Water, Ice, and Dragon, needed only much later.

Just as an example:

Giganceladus 
Atk: 1196, Fir: 280
Max Natural Sharpness: Blue
DPS: 44.86

The Crimsidian
Atk: 1012, Fir: 480
Max Natural Sharpness: Purple
DPS: 52.41

 Higher element and sharpness win out over higher raw damage.
(Unless of course, you're using a Greatsword or Hammer, in which case raw wins).

Phials:

Phials are the extra add-on to Switch Axes that boost Sword mode. This section will list all of them along with usefulness. (Ranked in no particular order)

Power: Easily the best of the phial to have for your Switch Axe. Increases raw damage by 25% and Burst becomes pure raw damage.

Element: This phial boosts the element of your Switch Axe during Sword mode by 25% and makes Burst almost all elemental damage. Pretty useful.

Fatigue: This phial makes every hit of Sword mode do Stamina damage as well. Burst becomes a big stamina drain. This phial is pretty damn good.

Dragon: This phial is only available on Dragon-based Switch Axes. It makes Sword mode do even MORE Dragon Damage, and Burst becomes fully Dragon. Only useful if you're fighting something weak to Dragon, obviously.

Status: (Paralysis/Poison) These phials make Sword mode gain Status effects for whichever phial you have. Burst becomes a huge amount of the status. Meh. 


Best of the Best:

These are just my own personal recommendations for which Axes to go for. I'm going to separate them by Low Rank (Rarity 1 - 3), High Rank (Rarity 4 - 7), and G Rank (Rarity 8 - 10). Low Rank isn't too necessary, but it can be helpful with tough monster battles. 

*Sharpness goes in order from weakest to strongest: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green Blue, White, Purple*

**INTRODUCTION: SUMMARIZED VERSION**

Hello, I'm Shirley, I love Gunlances and I'm a translation derp. 

As mentioned I'll be translating MH4 info, obtained from the latest issue of Dengeki Nintendo. 

Please refer to the [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1f0mxa/interest_check_mh4_translation_do_you_guys_want_it/) for more information on this project.

As usual I'll be including a sub-contents page in case people are confused. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.

**Greatsword**

- **SWEEP SLASH**: Annoyed by silly little critters that bounce about? Never fear, Sweep Slash is here. You can now rocket propel them away by swinging your GS in a wide frontal arc, much like what the Lance got at one point. This attack is only usable after...

- **JUMP SLASH**: That's right. You can now do the perfect YOLO attack by hitting a button mid-jump, bringing the blade down in a powerful, high-reaching overhead downswing. Perfect for crushing heads and looking like Conan.

- - -
**Longsword**

- **JUMPING SPIRIT BLADE**: A spirit blade combo only usable after jumping off from an elevated platform. Allows the hunter to perform some sort of continuous slash combo that uses up the spirit gauge, and scales with it. Apparently chains into the regular spirit combos.

- - -

**Sword &amp; Shield**

- **UPPERCUT SLASH**: What it says on the tin. By leaping off a platform the hunter can jump high into the air and uppercut some fools. This apparently chains into its own combo...

- **RUSH SLASH**: Causes the hunter to rush forward and stab the target, closing the distance between the hunter and target rapidly. This now sounds like a fighting game.

- **CHARGE SLASH**: What you SNS guys have been waiting for forever - By charging up an attack you can now unleash a strong jump slash that can chain into other SNS combos.


- - -
**Dual Swords**

- **AERIAL DEMON'S DANCE**: Yep, it's here. If the hunter is in a Demonized state before using Demon Evasion off elevated ground, pressing the attack button in mid-air will cause them to enter a series of Demon Dance twirls. It is possible to chain this attack into a Dance Finisher. *That's a lot of spinning.*

- - -

**Hammer**

- **JUMPING POUND**: Activated by jumping off a elevated ground while in charge mode. When the charge button is released in mid-jump, it unleashes a jumping pound attack.

- - -
**Hunting Horn** 

- **CHAIN NOTES**: This allows for a single swing to produce **TWO** notes, greatly increasing the speed of recital performances and buff casting. More like an... *&lt;horatio glasses&gt;* **unchained melody**.

- **JUMPING POUND**: Apparently more similar to a half-drunken dance off elevated ground, the horn is allowed to fall onto the target in a large upswing arc. Deals high damage.

- - -
| [Lance, **GUNLANCE REPRESENT!**](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814174261/) |
- - -

**Lance**

- **JUMP ATTACK**: An attack with extremely long reach, executed mid-jump. Hunters can hit hard-to-reach parts with this far-reaching attack. According to the article the lance is the only weapon with TWO kinds of jump attacks, but specifics on this are scarce.

- **CHARGE JUMP**: An attack that is executed by performing the lance charge off elevated ground. The charge continues on, and is capable of damaging enemies mid-flight.

- **U-TURN BRANDISH**: An attack executed mid-charge, it causes the hunter to abruptly stop and perform a U-Turn swipe attack, enabling the hunter to clear enemies behind them quickly.

- - -
**Gunlance** 

- **JUMPING SMASH**: A jumping overhead smash performed by leaping off elevated ground. This attack can chain into a normal Full Burst/ Shotgun blast on impact.

- **JUMP SHOT**: A jumping gunlance shelling attack. This attack allows the hunter to chain into other aerial attacks, making it the perfect setup for air combos. It is not known if the Jump Shot can be charged at this point.

| [One for the Gunners - The Bowgun Club](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814168111/) |
- - -

**Light Bowgun**

- **JUMPING RELOAD**: Because there's a lot more to do than just looking at the scenery before you hit the ground. Through technological innovation, ingenuity or sheer *boredom*, our esteemed gunner friends can now reload... in mid-air during a jump. This ability is shared with the HEAVY BOWGUN as well.

- - -
**Heavy Bowgun**

- **JUMPING RELOAD**: See above.

- **JUMP ATTACK**: Yes, apparently the Heavy Bowgun gets one as well - mainly because it's a **HEAVY** Bowgun. Disgruntled gunners can now leap off high platforms and use the power of gravity to share their weapon's weight with their target of choice (read: A wyvern's head). This counts as a direct attack (not known if it is sharp or blunt) and purportedly deals high damage.

- - -
| [Bow &amp; Switchaxe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814161631/) |
- - -

**Bow**

- **POWERSHOT**: A direct opposite of the normal arcing shots of the bow, the **POWERSHOT** occurs when the Hunter continues to charge their arrow after the first stage, resulting in a shot that fires dead straight at the target. As Bow Hunters will know, this shot is only available to certain Bow models. Batteries sold separately. 

- - -
**Switch Axe**

- **AERIAL SWITCH**: Allows the hunter to switch from Axe to Sword mode (and supposedly vice-versa, the article is not clear) when jumping off elevated ground. This attack acts as a combo set-up, and can chain into a variety of attacks.


- - - 

**Afterword**

I'll try to keep stuff updated on **ALL THREE** threads! Stay tuned and all that. 

If you would like to help, or provide me with any new information, I can be found on twitter @ateliershirley, PM'd here, or added on the WiiU at Atelier.shirley.

**Gathering of Songbirds** *(Requires HR3)* - Hunt two Qurupeco and two Crimson Qurupeco in the Deserted Island. Hehe, this is a fun one for reasons you'll figure out when you do it yourself. Completion rewards you with one or more Sparkly Fragments (always two? not sure), as well as a number of High Rank Peco parts. The Sparkly Fragments are used in crafting the Cosmic Mask (Sparkly Fragment x2, C.Peco Scale+ x2, and Bathycite Ore x2, as well as 1k Resources.) This mask supposedly makes your Shakalaka pick up items to sell after each quest. Looks weird has hell to boot.

**An Onimous Cry** *(Requires HR8)* - Hunt a Qurupeco in the Sandy Plains. Oh boy, I bet this is the simplest quest ever, and absolutely nothing could go wrong. Nah jk Peco's best friend Jho is particularily ""Savage"" in this quest. I 'believe' that this is the first appearance of a guaranteed Savage Jho spawn in game so far. Unless I'm mistaken, there is no event reward for this quest, seemingly only the chance at the rare 'Black Blood' Freehunt reward from killing the Jho.


Additionally, we get two more titles this week, **Loc Lac** and **Tart.**

Today I tackled the Rathalos for the first time in 3 Ultimate. I prepared as much as I could. Both traps, flash bombs, all types of potions, snuggled my poogie, etc. Anyway I went in knowing I wanted a Rathalos plate but knowing how the desire sensor works I wasn't expecting one.
   Well the fight starts and I'm doing well. I cut the tail, only use a couple potions and have it on the ropes. It flies off and takes out an apotonoth. I loot the shiny expecting a tear and as the Monster Hunter gods would have it, it's a plate! I was soooooo happy. For a second I thought maybe the desire sensor was malfunctioning or possibly didn't exist! For these thoughts the Sensor must have felt I should be ashamed and must repent. As I'm coming down to its last bits of health  it limps away and flies off to a different area. Good!, I think, I'll finish it off in this next area. This is when the Sensor decides to enact it's vengeance. As I'm transitioning area's the worst pops up,""Disc Read Error"". I was dumbstruck. I couldn't believe it. The plate was gone, I was going to have probably have to farm him for tens of hours to get another. I eject the disk and it is immaculate, not a speck of dirt or a scratch anywhere.
   I can only assume the Desire Sensor in all of it's technological prowess decided I must be punished for my earlier blasphemous thoughts by taking away what it saw fit to give me in the first place. This story is here to warn others of my mistake and mostly just to vent.

1375484944.0,50,self.MonsterHunter,1jlga4,Q: I am looking for &lt;INSERT RARE DROP HERE&gt;. What's the best way to get it? Should I kill or capture the monster? A: IT DEPENDS.,portmanteau,56,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jlga4/q_i_am_looking_for_insert_rare_drop_here_whats/,"**Q: Is it better to capture or kill a monster to get &lt;INSERT RARE DROP HERE&gt;?**

This seems to be a very frequently asked question on this board.  In the interest of perhaps cleaning up some of the question-asking submissions and outright incorrect replies that some of the aforementioned submissions garner, I will put to rest and answer this question once and for all.

To reiterate:

Q: Is it better to capture or kill a monster to get &lt;INSERT RARE DROP HERE&gt;?

**A: IT DEPENDS.**

There is no universal rule that unequivocally states that always killing the monster or always capturing the monster is the best way to get the drop you're looking for.  Regarding this question, if anyone says, ""always capture!  Capturing gets the best rewards!"" they are wrong.  If anyone says, ""always kill!  Killing gets you more carves than capturing the monster!""... well, this is a factually true statement.  (Usually, you get three carves from a monster corpse, and usually, you get two capture rewards for taking it alive.)  *But!* it doesn't mean that it's the best way to get the specific item that **you** are looking for.  It ultimately depends on what item the Desire Sensor/Random Number God is trying to keep you from getting.

Monsters have separate loot tables for capturing them and killing them.  They also have separate tables that determine which reward you'll get for breaking a part, as well as determining what you can get from a shiny drop.

*Separately*, a monster part you're looking for may also be a quest reward, independent of the monster or monsters you fight in that quest.  Sometimes, fighting a specific monster in a specific quest is the best way to maximize your chances of getting your item.

Now, to clarify on my original answer.

Q: What's the best way to get &lt;INSERT RARE ITEM HERE&gt;?

A: Look it up.  (**EDIT:**  I am assuming Monster Hunter 3U/3G for this question, as this game is the most popular one currently on this board.  If you want drop rates for another Monster Hunter game, you'll have to find your own drop rate lookup tables.)

http://kiranico.com/item/

http://www.gamefaqs.com/wii-u/683294-monster-hunter-3-ultimate/faqs/66820

The first is a link to Kiranico, an incredible website that offers very helpful ways to search the entire Monster Hunter 3U/3G database, including drop rates.  

The second is a Drop Rates FAQ on GameFAQs.  (**EDIT:**  The FAQ includes drop rates for Free Hunt/Invasion rewards, which are usually much higher and better than regular cap/kill rewards, but since you can't always be sure you can meet a specific monster in Free Hunt, we will ignore them for these purposes.)

Use whichever one you want.

Now, let's get more specific.  I'm going to help you figure out how to best get the rare item that *you* are looking for.  In the comments, I will give three specific examples.",,False,self,t5_2rron,1375485389.0,,,True,t3_1jlga4,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jlga4/q_i_am_looking_for_insert_rare_drop_here_whats/,

I’ve been aware of the MH series for quite some time, but had never committed. I’ll admit. I was a bit hesitant. I did more research on this game (including some great help from this sub) than I had ever done on a game previously. As +30 year old, with a full time job, a wife, a kid, and always a full social calendar my gaming time is limited. I’ve definitely become much more choosey on what I want to invest my time with. 

The sheer amount of content in this game had really piqued my interest. I’m a passionate fan of RPGs and their mechanics. Also, the traction this game has in Japan is impressive, even if this series doesn’t have the same amount of appeal to Western audiences. I really wanted to know what all of the hubbub was about. BUT, I fell in love with RPGs due to their stories. The game mechanics were something I learned to love, story was always my primary motivator. MH doesn’t have a story. Then I started hearing comparisons to Dark Souls. Now, I’ve never played Dark Souls, but I know my gaming tastes well enough to know I don’t enjoy bashing my face into a brick wall endlessly. I don’t want to play a game that is ridiculously hard for the sake of being ridiculously hard. Finally, although the amount of content in this game is unrivaled. Just trying to understand the game quickly became daunting, let alone playing it. 

Regardless, I decided to give it a go. MHU3 seemed to be the most comprehensive version to date – and hopefully a good jumping off point (if there were such a thing in the MH series). I started into the game and with about 8 hours under my belt I had my first complete set of armor, I had started to become semi-proficient with Dual Blades, had completed a variety of Level 1 gathering quests, was well stocked on potions, and was ready for my first big monster hunt! It was like my first day of school! I was excited, albeit a little nervous. But, my backpack was ready, I set out my clothes the day before, and had kissed my mother goodbye. Check, check, and double check. Unbeknownst to me there was a rather large bully waiting for me to get off the bus so he could push me down, give me wedgie, steal my milk money, and throw me in the trash can.

Off I went! A Qurupeco was in my sights! This giant bird like creature would be the first of many a monster I would slay. I would quickly take this one down and be on to the next. Heck, defeating this big bird seemed to be game formality than anything else. Just a little chop here, quick slice there, and then revel in glory!

After a quick exploration I spot my target. I slash around a bit. Whee! This is fun! I’m hunting monsters! The bird runs away. I run after it. Slash some more. Sharpen my blades. Bird runs again. I find it again. Start slashing, sharpen… and HOLY FUCK! There is now a big ass dragon thing here too. It’s cool. I can manage this right? I’ll just avoid the dragon and focus on my target. Okay. Now I’m dead. That dragon is proving to be slightly troublesome. It’s still cool. I brush myself off run around for a while trying to find big bird. And there is the dragon again. Annnnnnnnd now I’m dead again. I just need to focus. Deep breaths. Dragon. Dead.

Hmm. Maybe it’s just my weapon? I *did* have to sharpen it a lot. Maybe I just need a weapon that stays sharp longer? I get myself a long sword. Gather a bit. Upgrade it a couple times. And now I’m ready to go! Find the bird. Stab, stab, stab, slash, slash, slash. Now the bird is drooling! YES!!! I *must* be close to taking him down!? I can taste victory already! I’m definitely noticing some patterns and getting better a dodging and avoiding attacks. And now there is the dragon. And now I’m dead. Dragon. Dead. Dragon. Dead.

Okay. This is a little tougher than I originally thought. If only I could keep track of that bird and avoid the dragon. Time to take break, gather some supplies, and research. I have these dung bombs and paintballs I get at the beginning of each quest, but I’m not sure what to do with them. A couple wiki searches later I find out the dung bombs will drive the dragon away and paintballs will help me track the Qurupeco! Perfect! That’s exactly what I need! 

Third attempt. Find bird. Track with paintball. Slash, slash, jab, jab. Dragon. Throw dung bomb. Dragon flees. Find bird (more quickly this time). Slash, slash. Dodge, dodge. Jab. Dodge. Now the bird is drooling and panting. FINALLY! This is it! Get my monster hunter badge of awesomeness ready. The problem is all of this dodging and slashing seems to be running down my stamina. I’m out of breath pretty quickly and this bird seems pretty pissed. It’s more violent and aggressive than it was before. I can’t seem to keep up… and I’m dead. And dead. And dead.

Fourth attempt. This time I’ve stocked up on meat, which will keep up my stamina! Bird. Paintball. Slash. Dodge. Dragon. Dung bomb. Bird. Slash. Potion. Potion. Potion. Dodge. Dragon. Dung bomb. Meat. Bird. Slash. Jab. Dodge. AND **WINS!!!**

What a rush! This wasn’t like any regular videogame win I have had before. I didn’t win because I had the biggest and baddest weapon. I didn’t win because I had the most hit points or strongest armor. I won because I [read: me, videogame player] got better each time. Each time I learned new ways to play better, how to use items better, how to defend better, when to attack better. And with that revelation, I, regardless of the many attempts to understand Monster Hunter, finally actually understood Monster Hunter. I’m pretty excited to hunt my next monster. I’m even excited to be destroyed by that monster.

Let me preface by saying that I never got to Jho in Tri (spent a lot of time screwing around with low-HR friends), so this was my very first goal in 3U - beating the stuffing out of him at the first opportunity. I went in with the Acrus Lance+ and full Volvidon armor, sleep/para meats, dung bombs, bombs, etc... Basically let him take care of the Jaggia and just went to town underneath him. Broke his face, cut his tail (2x tails btw), sleepbombed him, only got pounced once...  

So 45 minutes pass, I've got one trap left, and I know he's gotta be close to dying. He runs off to Area 2 and rages as soon as I get there and upstab his belly; while he's rage-face'ing Cha-Cha I set up my trap and start taunting him, tranqs at the ready.  

I kid you not, he stared at me for ten seconds and ran off to the next zone, rage mist trailing behind like an offensive gesture.

The next five minutes involved me frantically trying to get him to run to the Jaggia den so I could still have the chance of killing him and not fail the quest (which is when he pounced me). He finally does, and I'm down to a minute. Sixty seconds of pressing my advantage, guard-advancing every time he backs away, stabbing and flinching and dodging like a boss.  

Fifteen seconds left, and he enters rage mode for the last time, backing up for a dragon breath. I guard-advance for what I hope is a last-minute save, only this time I'm too far back. I watch his malice spread across the screen and hit-- A JAGGIA. THE LAST. JAGGIA. I took the hit, but was granted immortality a frame before in order to wreak my vengeance upon Jho for his insolence.  

Thirty seconds into the remaining minute, I've broken his face and sent him reeling into a corner of the map... Where Cha-Cha's thrown bomb explodes in his chest and sends the beast to his grave. Exhausted, worn, and *extremely* satisfied, I saunter toward his corpse for some last minute carving aaaaaand... Exit to the next zone.  

The bastard died out of bounds.  

No harm though, I did it and now I can focus on upgrading my lance and armor so that I can increase my times (playing cautious during rage mode didnt help that) and really put the hurt on him.

After much deliberation, icbat, wipqozn, and myself have decided to forego a full website (for now) in favor of an IRC channel for chatting.

[Click Here to join the Monster Hunter IRC!!](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##monsterhunter)

It's a basic chat system, put in a username and off you go. I'll try and be on and active as often as possible, so feel free to chat me up! I encourage you all to bookmark that page and hop on whenever you're playing and near a computer!

I'm not very experienced in IRC channels, but I know at least this much: if you would like to create your own channel with a select group of hunters (and use it instead of the built-in chat on the Wii U), just type in ""/join ##CHANNELNAME"". That will create a new tab in the interface for that specific channel name, which can be anything that isn't already in use. ""##mh123"" or ""##mhgate17"" or something.

So come join me and lets get pumped for the impending release!!

We're so close to the release of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate! I can hardly contain my excitement, and I've temporarily lost friends who are tired of hearing me talk about it. But that's neither here nor there. What is here is an update on the [OGB Translation](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/198f9u/translation_of_1200_page_guide/) and the [""Hunting Club""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/19m2kw/i_want_to_form_the_reddit_hunting_club/)

First, the translation project. I have successfully removed the binding from one of the two guides I imported, and have scanned every single page into a pdf. This pdf will be provided to members of the google group who have signed on to help us translate the info it contains. The original plan was to overlay text onto the original scans, but that plan has changed. What we really want to do is provide the community with as much information as possible, and we believe this will best be achieved by creating a ""companion"" to the Japanese guide, one that is entirely in english but contains none of the copyrighted images or graphs in the original. All the information will be preserved, but in a format we can distribute without repercussions. Translation will begin very shortly, and we'll hopefully have another update soon with progress.

Second, the ""hunting club"". My original vision was to create a website for hunters to go, a ""one-stop-shop"" for everyone to chat, organize hunts, trade items, and ask for help. I enlisted the help and guidance of two of our own, wipqozn and icbat, and have been discussing ideas with them. The plan has evolved into a less complicated solution. Club Teamwork has [a ""Hunting Parties"" system](http://teamworkcast.com/parties/) that is very well done, and has its own community of users. I believe that if the subscribers from our subreddit began using it for organizing hunts, both our community and theirs can benefit from it. I will talk to the other moderators about posting this on the sidebar, and top of the main page, as our official go-to for organizing hunts. As far as a chat system goes, I believe we're going to implement an IRC for us to use. This will also be posted on the side and top as our ""go-to"" for communication during the hunt, and for live chatter. IRC's have the ability of creating a room on the fly, so users who meet up in general chat for the purpose of slaying a monster can all navigate to their own chat room and use that for communication. I believe we may hold off on this to at least see how the game itself turns out, and then implement something. 

I believe that's all for now. If anyone has any questions, please let me know!!",,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,SAU,True,t3_1a0bbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1a0bbh/update_on_mh3g_official_guide_translation_and/,moderator

Hello friends!

As we've recently learned from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/197xcg/brady_guide_digital_and_only_250_pages/), and with confirming info on [this page](http://monsterhunternews.com/2013/02/bradygames-mh3u-digital-strategy-guide-pre-order/) and [BradyGames' Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151481800131278&amp;set=a.81134026277.114819.76382171277&amp;type=1), i'm sure many people are as disappointed as i am that we wont see the true ultimate MH bible come to the west.

but would it be possible to get a group of friends together, import one of these guides, and then divide up the translating of the guide among these friends? and what if those friends all came from a common subreddit, amounting to hundreds of people. it would be quite the undertaking, and would take some time. but wouldn't it be worth it?

let me know your thoughts!

edit: After a little research, i found this website, http://www.newocr.com/. If the scans are high enough quality (shouldn't be too hard with just a normal scanner), then this would make the translation process simpler than trying to learn japanese, or trying to manually input the characters into a translator based off what is on the page.

edit2: I've done a proof of concept. Using [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xftpcYcauqg), i screen captured a line of text that was mostly legible. uploaded it into newocr, then put the output into Google Translate. [Here's the quick album of the quick translation](http://imgur.com/a/msA1S). As you can see, [this is the weapon, name and picture are perfect](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Marine_Fisher). 

edit3: I've created a Google Group to manage this undertaking. I HAVE PURCHASED* the guide and will scan it myself, and translation will be done through the group itself. Anyone who would like to help in translation, please go to [THIS LINK](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mhguide), sign in with your Google account, and apply for membership. I believe this is best done through the use of something more official like a Google Group as opposed to a less secure and more open platform. It will take quite some time for this guide to arrive, so signing up now will mean you wait just a bit for any translating. But when the guide arrives, I'll let this group know, and post a follow-up post on the subreddit, followed by weekly updates.

What's really increadible and I'm sad I didn't get an individual pic of it, was the well-done steaks. Basically BBQ wings wrapped in bacon. holy shit. AMAZING. Also the fact that she managed to conspire with my best friend to do this all the while I was totally oblivious. I am a lucky man.
 
We also played the shit out of some MHFU since my buddy's custom firmware PSP died, so I gave him my old one and grabbed a VITA for myself.

The wife also had these commissioned:

	With the release of MH3U I thought it would be a good idea to start a “weekly stupid question thread”. I figured this could be a good way for new hunters to ask questions about the game without flooding the subreddit with new threads and also without fear of being struck down by some of the more ‘passionate’ hunters (although I’ve been very impressed by the amount of civility on this board so far). 


If this receives positive feedback I’ll continue to post these threads weekly. If this isn’t wanted I’ll recede back into my cave and continue to hunt, emerging periodically to consume large cuts of meat.

I haven’t played a MH title since MHFU so I am still quite a bit rusty on my combinations/skills. With that said, I’ll open up with the first question: In MHF you could combine Mega Nutrients and honey to make a Max Potion, which was one of the essential items I would bring with on every quest. I haven’t got very far in MH3U, but is this combo still in the game? If so, is the combo the same? I also remember bringing an ancient potion and lifepowder on every quest – do these still exist? If they do, what are the recipes? ( fyi: Lifepowder would heal everyone in the zone. Ancient Potions maxed stamina and health. Max potions restored all your health and also set it to maximum.)

I did some basic calculations and here's the answer: you're better off with the Critical Eye +3 skill than Attack Up (L) when the base damage for your weapon is **greater than**:

* 1282 for Great Sword,
* 881 for Long Sword,
* 374 for Dual Swords / Sword and Shield ,
* 1388 for Hammer,
* 1228 for Hunting Horn / Switch Axe,
* 614 for Lance / Gunlance,
* 347 for Light Bowgun,
* 395 for Heavy Bowgun (454 for limiter removed),

A few minutes ago I realized that I had a notification on my DS saying that I had received a guild card from somebody! Is there any way of looking them up or contacting them? I only got the guild card, nothing else from street pass.

EDIT: I looked at his play history and he's been teaming up with a bunch of other hunters! Is it possible that he's just playing online through the WiiU, or have I stumbled on a group of players???

There is a status effect called 'sleep'. It is distinct from tranquillising a monster in a trap to capture it. It works like paralysis -- but once you apply enough of it the monster actually falls alseep. The way you know this is happening is that the background music stops, the monster stops and slowly lies down. The silence is quite uncanny. When this happens you should not attack the monster as it will wake it up. Whoever sleeped the monster probably has some bombs ready to explode in the monster's face for massive damage and part breakage (3x normal damage is my understanding). Sleep arrows, pellets, knives and weapons make the same splat sound like the tranquillisers do (drugged meat is for sleeping the monster too). So watch out for them.

TL;DR: when the music + monster stop, stop attacking, set some bombs up and explode them for massive damage. Don't wake up a sleeping giant.

PS: Yes, the strategy has been abused in the past, but personally I only do it once per hunt, because it is essentially free damage with some bows + bombs.

You might have known about a few of these already, but here we go.

* Early weapon paths will likely involve Icecrystals to upgrade to the next part. If you are on the early village quests without access to the tundra, go to the solo tavern, accessed by the cat on the southwest part of moga. There will be a paw pass quest for the tundra right away, and you can go to zone 6 which has the chance for Ice crystals.

* If you find yourself going on gathering quests for the tundra or volcano frequently, it is worth creating the Barioth hunting horn. It is a horn that is obtainable in low rank and provides both hot and cold cancel through playing songs, negating the need for hot/cold drinks. This goes perfectly with leather armor to make the ultimate mining/bug catching machine.

* If you want a rare trade from the argosy captain, bring traps and tranqs and capture the creatures in free hunt rather than kill them. You are more likely to get the trade item when you do your hunt report.

* If you are in need of village resource points, if you haven't already, go to the dlc section and download the ""Extras"" section, you can start the game with 5000 points right off the bat and it takes only a minutes work.

* If you are still in need of resources, the best way of gathering points is not actually from doing free hunt. If you have access to Urugaan, go on the hunt. Bring pickaxes, and fight him until you knock him over. Walk over to his legs and press ""A"". You will proceed to mine from the brute, which has a 50% chance to result in a Lava Nugget. These bad boys can be turned in to Junior for **1500** resource points. The best part is, you can mine the Urugaan **every time you knock him down**, resulting in insane resource points in a very short amount of time.

* If you do not have access to Urugaan yet, do the quest to capture a Royal Ludroth. Break the mane, you will have a chance at Quality Sponges, which can be turned in for 1000 points, not too shabby early on.

Hopefully these little tips have helped somebody out, and maybe if you did know some of these, you still learned something. Good Hunting!",,False,self,t5_2rron,1364276134.0,,DS,True,t3_1b0lll,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1b0lll/basic_tips_for_gathering_resources_and_materials/,

While visions of equipment danced in their heads.
And mamma in her armor, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our blades for a long winter’s nap.

I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

We  have recently hit and surpassed the 3000 subscriber mark on our humble subreddit, and I couldn't be more excited! I created this subreddit a couple years ago when I was in a MHFU kick with my freshman roommate at college, after looking in vain for an existing Monster Hunter subreddit. It took about a year and a half to hit 500 subscribers, but it really has taken off since then! Thank you, everyone, for your continued dedication to this particular Monster Hunter-related board. I really love being able to come here and see everyone's questions, advice, pictures, videos, accomplishments, etc.

The other moderators and I have been trying to get the subreddit up to the standards of other big-name franchises. This is mostly accomplished through aesthetic improvements (thanks Fortuan and JalenTheEpic for your help in that department), and we are always open to new ideas as to how to improve it further. Since we are a community of people who share a specific interest, the moderation team is always open to suggestions and criticisms. For example, due to the impending release of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, there have been many purchasing related posts, and a fellow Hunter suggested a consolidated location for this information. [We were happy to oblige, and you can find this link on the sidebar!](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/18g6zp/ways_to_buy_mh3u/)

Thank you all again for joining myself and the other Hunters on the Monster Hunter subreddit. I look forward to March when we can share stories and hunt together on MH3U, as well as help all the newcomers that will undoubtedly discover /r/MonsterHunter in the coming weeks!

Have some questions that could help.",Demonomicron,37,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1chjpg/bought_mhu3_having_trouble_getting_the_game_have/,"Hi all. I bought MHU3. It seems like a pretty cool game, but it also seems to assume some level of game mechanic familiarity. As such I am a bit confused about some of the points of the game that it didn't explain:

1. Should I hold on to every random item I get or should I be selling stuff for cash? I get all of these weird random items during quests and I don't know what to do with them. I mean things like bones, parts of animals, random plants, and other weird stuff. If this was an Elder Scrolls game I'd be selling all of this crap for cash. Should I hold on to this stuff obsessively in case I need it later or should I sell it?

2. What's this whole Resources / Commodities thing? Are Resources and Commodities items? Like, the same items I'm talking about above? How do I know when I have a resource? Or a commodity? What does each do? And what's the difference between these and items?

3. Should I be stressing about upgrading / forging weapons and armor early in the game (&lt; 10 hours) or should I just chill out and go on simple quests and free hunting? I can't tell how aggressive I am supposed to be about this.

4. Should I use the shops in town, like the item and gear shops? Or should I just find stuff, craft stuff, and forge stuff? I can't quite tell what the game wants me to do here. It almost seems like I should ignore the shops.

Thanks in advance!

Sure enough, when I went over there this morning I was able to buy a copy. I ran like a bandit out of there after I purchased it. I have also heard a report on Gamefaqs of a person in Charlottetown PEI buying it at that TRU location too.

The in-box instruction manual is very minimalist/terrible. However, the in-game instructions are quite detailed (hit the home button to access).

Online functionality appears to be working. I patched to 1.01 and am able to download all of the DLC and ""Extras"". I was able to connect to the online server though a total of 0 people were online besides me.

The most confusing thing for me so far was why the health/item/map didn't appear on the TV screen. Apparently, you can't have it on both the gamepad AND TV at that same time. So you have to take them off the gamepad for them to be visible, which is really a MUST if you are using a Pro controller.

Today, HappyWulf submitted [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/184g06/found_this_2d_mh_style_game_on_ks_today/), a link to the Kickstarter for Artizens. The game is a 2D monster hunting game, with emphasis on cooperative online play, crafting of equipment, and user generated content. I checked it out and was immediately intrigued, and have become a backer myself.

The team at Artizens, Inc. quoted Monster Hunter as being an inspiration in the creation of their game, as well as Mega Man and Magic the Gathering. As a Hunter myself, and as a mod of this fine subreddit, I decided to shoot them a message, invite them to our subreddit, and asked permission to advertise their campaign just a bit.

Everything about the game is extremely appealing to a huge Monster Hunter fan such as myself, and I encourage everyone to go give their video and description a look!

[Here's a link to the Kickstarter!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artizens/artizens-0)

[Here's a link to their website!](http://www.artizensonline.com/)

[And here's the subreddit!](http://www.reddit.com/r/artizens)

Thanks everyone for reading, and happy hunting!!

While there's a lot going on, there are also checked and proven guides for every element of the game now. There's no excuse for shooting from the hip when someone asks a question - if you don't know the answer, don't guess and make it look like you know. Either look it up, be crystal clear that you're not 100%, or don't post.

1. Please don't yell ""cap"" many times in a row if you don't have cap guru skill active.  Never mind the fact that you're shouting orders in someone else's room, but at least don't be guessing.  If you're going to act sideways, at least be correct about it.

2. Please don't criticize people if you don't have any suggestions for improvements.  Saying ""too slow"" is not a valuable comment.  Too slow compared to what?  Whom?  With what equipment?  Items are allowed or not?  Bombs, status effects yes or no?  Under what conditions?  It's a worthless statement.  If you don't like how fast something is going, be polite and keep that shit to yourself please.  If you want to make a criticism, fine, but be constructive.

3. If you're going to join someone's room, don't try to run the show without the room owner's consent.  Don't try to hijack the situation.  I am pretty chill and generally if you ask me to run a quest, I may not agree to do it instantly right that second, but chances are good I'll do it soonish.  And if I won't do it, I'll say it so you won't have to waste your time.  Either way it makes no sense to try to take charge in someone else's room.

Generally I am really relaxed and I love to have fun.  I have over 600 hours in this game by now and I am HR 61.  I play this game for both fun and challenge.  I like to have a relaxed atmosphere.  And nothing ruins it faster than some jackass with an agenda trying to speed things up or to run the show his way in your room, without anyone's consent.  And if you're such a ""leet"" player, then be nice about it.

If you are so bloody leet, instead of complaining about simple farming runs failing to reach 30 second times in G rank, why don't you test your mettle in the arena where the equipment and conditions are standard and your timings can actually mean something?

So please keep it light, keep it fun, and respect room owners.  And use common sense.  The best place to make constructive criticisms is online and not inside 30 character chat lines anyway.  So shut up and enjoy.  And relax!  It's not a race for fuck's sake.  It's a game.

I didn't know what I was going to think of the dual blades as a weapon type, but I'm definitely a fan now.

So obviously it's still monster hunter, so it plays great, and I don't feel like there's much that needs to be said about the gameplay, I more wanted to just express a few minor concerns and hear other peoples' thoughts on them. (Also note I've only played Tri before, so when I mention weapons or monsters being new, I mean not in Tri).

 - No instruction/guide: Not much of an issue for me, but for brand new players I can imagine they'd be extremely lost as far as controls are concerned (however it did take me a little bit of time experimenting with shooting Popo in the safety of area 1 to get a handle on the bow being a new weapon type). However, I do hope that the final release doesn't follow the trend of minimalistic instruction booklet inserts. Having a page dedicated to each weapon type can be *extremely* beneficial when starting out or trying your hand at a new weapon. **[Edit: I've been informed that a manual is accessible by pressing the home button]**

 - Text hard to read?: Maybe it was just me, but a lot of the text seemed hard to read to me. Messing around with the 3D depth slider sometimes helped, though lots of times it still came out looking pixelated or unclear. I was playing on an original 3DS, so maybe the text sizes and fonts were just optimized for the display on the 3DSXL and shrinking them down to fit the smaller screens messes it up. Anyone else have this issue?

 - Special attack button difficult to hit or not responsive: I just had trouble with the touch screen special attack button. I'm not sure if there will be an option to move it when were allowed to customize the lower screen layout or not, but, as a switch axe lover, I hope so.

 - I really miss having Zl and Zr for swimming: I now understand why people complained about underwater hunting. Having the shoulder buttons for simple swim up and swim down was lovely, and now I have real difficulty moving through the water unlike before. Maybe I'll have to get a CPP. Any tips on handling moving through the water better?

 - **I love the target camera!:** obviously there's no complaint or gripe here, I just wanted to praise the wonderfulness of this feature.

 - Hooray for free passage from area **5** back to **3** in the tundra!: That's gonna be a big time saver when it comes time to hunt Gigginox (also, dark caves can suck it). *[edit: had wrong area numbers]*

But place them at the worst of times.

For those who don't know, while in rage mode, a pitfall trap or shock trap contain the monster for a less amount of time compared to if they were not in rage mode. If the monster is fatigued, it increases the time they're in the trap.

Along with that, each consecutive trap [of the same type]* last a little bit shorter than the first.

People placing a trap 2 minutes in when the monster first rages is really irksome. If it's a monster that's constantly in rage mode (looking at you Diablos) then majority of the time it's because your teams DPS is more than enough to kill the monster and I don't have much gripe over that. But when I see you place a trap at seemingly random times and only when the monster is in rage mode, I would just like to let you know that you can be a better and more effective hunter by having a little bit more awareness and a slight alteration to your play style.

Pitfall traps also are more effective against a fatigued monster than a shock trap. They last 2x longer (don't quote me on that exact figure) and if they're asleep/paralyzed/KO'd while in the trap the trap timer is paused until they start thrashing about again. So if you see someone place a pitfall trap and notice the monster is fatigued, please stop attacking it. You might put it into rage mode and miss that window of opportunity. Your 2~3 strings of attack combos is probably less damage than the extra 5 seconds your entire team gets to whack at the monster. *And as /u/adrian783 pointed out, allows more time to focus on breaking parts*


If anyone would like to add or correct anything said here, holler.

Added Information: Nargacuga can **only be trapped by a pitfall trap while in rage mode**. 


A side rant: For you GS users, upswinging with a GS should be less than 1% of the attacks you do. Heck you shouldn't be infinite comboing in a multiplayer fight period unless you're the only one by the tail and you're out of position to charge. But when I'm using a GS, I snipe with it so I might be a bit biased..

Here are the tips I have accumulated over my 400+ hours of monster hunter. Feel free to add your own.

1. Capture Guru is your best friend. Get it through the bone armor set, or the perception skill. once you have that skill at 10 points or more, paintball the target and the paintball will flash when hes absolutely ready to cap. I have heard that it will ping if hes not paintballed, but im not sure on that one.

2. Wait for the monster to limp. This is a good way to gauge his health. when the monster is at 25% health or so, he will start an exaggerated limp. This is the time to capture.

3. Never ever lay a trap in the first zone you see him limp in. this is a sure fire way to waste a trap. Once a monster starts limping, theres a 95% (made up) chance that he will limp away into another area. if your clever, you can use this to your advantage, but if you need this info, then its safer to just wait. I always try to lay traps when said monster gets into a new zone.

4. Give him some time! Do not wail on him and wail and wail and kill him on accident. chances are good your not strong enough to kill him accidently, but if you think you could possibly be, or if you wack him and stun him a bunch and knock him over and break his face... get back and give him a chance to show you how wounded he is.

5. don't wait for him to be in the trap to tranq him. If you know hes ready, and you know you can get the trap down and him into it, dont wait, toss a few tranqs at him before he gets into the trap. This doesn't mean hit him with tranqs right when you show up at the start of the quest. This means tranq him a minute or two before he falls into said trap and thats probbaly streaching it just a bit.
          
6. Traps are finiky, there are a few factors that go into how long a monster stays in a trap. some are resistant to certain traps, some aren't. The amount of stamina a monster has, or the amount of times a monster has been in said trap in the fight. I try to save one type of trap for caping, and not use it more than once unless I have to. This may not be an option for you, but it normally will be. 

7. If you follow these guidelines and get a monster limping, and you place a trap and hit him with two tranqs and its still not capped... dont just stand there wondering or throwing more tranqs, beat him senseless. if its his first trap and hes in it for a while, beat him into submission. this actually does work. you can push him over the edge by attacking him and possibly getting him to the point of capture if you just off by a hair. this obviously works better in multiplayer. try to coordinate with your friends, one is tranqing the others are attacking.

I have no intentions of updating them and shouldn't have to seeing great people like [VioletKira](http://www.reddit.com/user/violetkira/), who made a pretty bad ass MHP3rd Monster Guide over at [Gamefaqs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/psp/991479-monster-hunter-portable-3rd/faqs/61490?page=0#section15), the people working on a total translation of the MH3G Bible and [Monster Hunter Wikia](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com) are on the case.



That being said, I didn't get ANY of this out of thin air. My sources are as follows:

[atwiki.jp](http://www10.atwiki.jp/mh3g/pages/20.html): Where ALL my monster weakness data came from.

[Violet Kira's Monster Guide](http://www.gamefaqs.com/psp/991479-monster-hunter-portable-3rd/faqs/61490?page=0#section15): I can't read japanese so I used some of his naming conventions and drew some inspiration from his tables to the layout of mine.

[Monster Hunter Wikia](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/MH3U:_Monsters): Westernized names for the monsters.



I'd like to reiterate I simply planned this for personal use so a few things are kind of obscure or not explained well. I'll probably be busy chopping off tails and taking carves but I might pop back to answer some stuff. Good hunting to all of you and I hope at least some of you might find this useful!

I've seen a bit of confusion about this skill lately in multiple places (mostly about what it actually does), so I figured I'd post this here for visibility.

The ""Artillery"" skill tree (Novice/Expert when activated - old name is Gunnery Master/King) has had a slight change in MH3U.

The +10 version, Artillery Novice, now increases the power of ballista bolts, cannonballs, crag shots, gunlance shellings, and Wyvern's Fire.

The +15 version, Artillery Expert, further increases all of these, and in addition, reduces the cooldown of Wyvern's Fire by 30 seconds (from 2 minutes to 1 minute 30 seconds).

If for whatever reason you can't access your TV or you just want to be polite and not interrupt whoever is using the TV these instructions are for you.

**Offline Gamepad configuration**

1) Select your character in the main menu using type 1 (default, TV would show game) remember you need to press “A” a few times.

2) Register a panel set that has no UI on the gamepad (this can be done before hand). Select the panel settings with no UI.

3) Exit those panel settings so you see moga village map with “B”

4) Press select, left, up, A, left, down, down, A, right, A

You have now configured your gamepad to type 2 and you can change your panels.

Note: You cannot change your panel settings if you set your game to type 2 in the main menu because the gamepad will no longer function as a touch screen so you cannot configure your panels. Although yes you could change your panel settings and save before stopping each MH session to configure without a TV.

**Turning on your mic for Network Mode in Type 2**

This can be done with the normal menu options when in network mode games.

A Song of Wyvern Fire and Ice 

it is a new day. i am awakened to the sound of carts carrying fallen comrades back to town. they have all fainted during a routine farming operation in the moga woods. i am still recovering from my battle with lagi but i figure a little moga cola with mossy cheese will help start my day. 


i was planning on sitting napping but the village is in a state of unrest. i elect to head over to the tavern, hammer in hand and see what the fuss is about. 


after petting my piggy (a compulsion i know, but my tribe has a theory that doing so will ward off bad omens and luck) i tell Fu-Man-Chu (my cat house keeper) to stay out of my honey reserves and head out.


walking around the village i wave to the ""Gal with the Goods"" who then proceeds to giggle, point and laugh. i have realized when i was changing out my gear... i am pantless. 


sigh


after walking home to change, shame in hand (and by shame i mean my short sword and berries) i consider the ways i can exact revenge on Fu-Man-Chu for letting me leave without pants.


the tavern is packed tonight. there are lots of people i know as well as some new faces. Neokrilik is boasting about his love for his new Switch axe. i pass by Sgtsheabo and give a head nod. he is still wearing equipment from decades ago. well earned gear, he is a vet and respected by the townsfolk. i sit down at my usual seat in the back and order a moga cola.


while there are people in good spirits, there are a few hunters discussing the recent events. a rathian has been harassing hunters as then clean their gear in a watering hole. its bad enough that we have to worry about melynx's stealing our potions, but we have those poisoning fanged terrors busting our chops. i lean over to Rev713 as he talks to me about how he yearns to get back into the battlefield with a swtich axe, a new invention compared to the old days. Uncle Scrotes joins in, saying that he has been busy getting materials for his bow collection. even since he nailed a Plessy between the eyes, he has forsaken all other weaponry. 


there is a sudden commotion in the tavern, we pause to find out that aCatNamedHitler has been getting wild after hooking up with the G rank guild sweet hearts. we turn our attention to the problem at hand...


the rathian has to be dealt with. i pay my tab and head off to the woods, with my fellow hunters wishing me luck. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



I start off my hunt as always, checking my gear, realizing that i left potions at home again and sharpening my hammer. 


i pass by a roaming band of Apanoth considering if i should partake in a snack. i could always go for a well done steak, but after mixing that with a power juice last time... never again.


i enter the area after hearing Ian roar. 


my hammer is getting heavy but i know my duty. i must slay this beast. 


i begin my assault. cha cha break off from the hunt.... to slay a vprey. i know not to question the ways of cha cha. he is wise, although i will never understand his wanton need to charge head on into a fireball. some believe it is the chachas sadomasochistic desires... his fury knows no bounds. meanwhile, my war hammer thirsts for pain


i ready my hammer, with a great charge i deliver the first blow to ian. she takes numerous swipes at me as i dodge, tuck and roll. although my body isnt what it used to be ( i used to dodge monoblos charges at point blank range) i evade its attacks. knowing that i cannot cut off its tail i have to make my hits count on its head or trip the female queen of the skies. 


i deliver many successfuly blows to face of the beast knocking it out. 


slam, slam, slam. i rest from hitting this beast and sharpen my hammer. while i hammer would be normally better as blunt as possible, having an angled front helps guide the force of this mallet of destruction.


the Ian awakens, completely enraged spewing fireballs left and right as cha cha has finally finished plunging its staff at the hearts of vprey. 


i charge up another slam and deliver a blow to its legs. pound, pound GOLD SWING! the beast loses its balance and topples over. i hear a cracking sound. the ian is having trouble getting up. i believe i have injured its legs. it relents and staggers its way to its feet with me still going wild on its face and legs. my body's muscle memory of pounding and golf swinging at wyverns 


the ian however, changes it tactics. it has taken to the skies which leaves my hammer and efforts for naught. oh how i wish i had Uncle Scrotes and his bow with me. it proceeds to use its advantage fliping majestically through the air. thinking i am safe, i sharpend but i end up getting clipped by her tail leaving my armor damaged and i being to feel ill. 


i have been poisoned. my reckless abandon and confidence has cost me. chacha guides me back to my feet. cha cha begins to dance and i feel my health returning but i am still ill. 


the ian lands, although my vision is waning, its hard to miss her face (and her breath... yikes!) i swing wildly, knowing that if i am going down, i will at least soften up this monster for another hunter to take my place. 


with its face broken and legs mashed, the ian leaves. as i turn to hunt her down i am reminded of my times as a young hunter, the lessons i learned. i manage to scrounge up some mushrooms to cure my poison status. after tripping balls for a time, i steady myself, hammer in hand and head to the monsters nest knowing that the more time i take, the more it will heal itself. i am growing frustrated. my hands ca barely lift my hammer now, as i grip my 3ds.. i mean, my weapon i roam the jungle. 


jumping past 2 bahabra who try to sting me, i curse their name. 


i arrive at the nest


the ian appears to have just settled in. the carcass of a vprey has barely started to stink. (more so than normal). 


this is my chance, i walk right up to its face, raise my hammer and as i try to deliver a critical blow...


i am pounced on by some of the vpreys bretheren who has slipped into the nest. my armor has taken most of the damage but the commotion of me getting hit (and the rude bastard who shoved me on the train) has caused a critical error. i turn my hammer and relinquish the minion of its life.


but the ian is awake and angry. 


i being to run around and swipe at the monsters feet tripping it. the ian will likely take to the skies... 


so i smash its wings, crippling it further... the hunter is not out yet. 


the ian trys one last charge. i have grown weary of this battle. 


i charge my hammer, walk up and position myself in Ians charge. as i face the beast V3rgil and I have one resounding thought... ""THIS ENDS NOW"" 

anddddd.... swing too early. i was moving as i charged my hammer and the momentum and early release has caused me to spin wildly... i am done for. 


the ian runs head long into one of my spins... cracking it upside its head draining the life from its eyes. i barely notice as i am still locked in a merri-go-round spin attack. 


Quest Completed.


i continue to spin until i let go of my hammer nearly creaming chacha who has begun to raid the nest for eggs. 


i sit down and rest. the threat is gone. 


but then the real challenge has began... lugging this carcass back to the town for proof... and carry my huge hammer back to base. 


a hunters work is never gone.

-Slay on my brothers.

[MH3U],Ganadorf,32,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ecxdm/so_ive_made_the_battlehealer_i_always_wanted_to/,"After 90 hours sunk into MH3U, I've finally built the battle-healer idea I've had in my head since low rank. This will require a 2+ slot weapon and is recommended for group play. Check it out


**Skills:**
* Horn Maestro
* Wide-Range +2
* Recovery Level
* Sharpness +1


Now, this build will revolve around the HH, but I'm sure it could be adapted to other weapons.


**Gear:**
* Helios Z
* Damascus Chest X
* Vangis Gloves X
* Qurupeco Cord X
* Qurupeco Greaves X
* Talisman: Wide-Range 9(+)


I've made this set to act as a healer, but one that can dish out damage while doing so. I personally used the  **Eternal Music Box**. This is a requirement for me because it has 3 sockets, and the HG earplugs/Affinity up buffs. The extra +15 defense is just icing on the cake, really.

The main strengths of this build is that you can heal your party members with 125% effectiveness potions and herbs. Recovery Level boosts all health potions on you by 25%, but Wide-range sends that out to your party as well. Very strong synergy here. Finally, you have Sharpness +1 to boost you up to purple sharpness on most endgame weapons.

Please note that the decorations for this build can be fickle, and will require you to fill all slots appropriately.

Let me know what you guys think!

Since Reddit is an online community the best way we can meet up is an online version.  Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate for the Wii-U is the game we're going to be playing.  No need for anything extra than your system and your time!

**When?**

We'll be holding the hunts on Sundays at an arranged time.  Us hunters come from many time zones so the schedule will be set once all 4 hunters are decided between those hunters.

**Who get's to go?**  

Every Wednesday there will be a ""recruitment"" post that determines who will hunt.  We'll have a variety of people to hunt with.  This recruitment thread will have invited guests from time to time  but the majority of hunters will be determined by top voted comments on the recruitment thread.  Each week will have it's own question or statement.  

**Where?**

Well the /r/MonsterHunter Reddit rooms of course!  Free Play 2, Lobby 8, name /r/mhSM (for monster hunter Sunday Meetup) pass rmh.  If you forget, the password or our regular lobby it's on the sidebar.

**After Hunt Post**
After the meetup is finished we'll have a discussion thread to talk about what happened afterwards.  We don't have to have screen captures, although you're welcome to do so, we're just gonna talk about it.  Have discussion on the monsters, talk about how we goofed up, or w/e conversations come from meeting up.

**Who's running this Shin-Dig?**
Fortuan, that's me!  Feel free to message me or post on this thread for any questions or suggestions!

**early start**
since we missed Wednesday this week I'll just post today's question.  This first time will have me just as a meetup to see a few of you guys and the top 3 posts to this question  ""Who's In!?""

**Sorry folks**
I'm terribly sorry all, I'm the one orgaizing this at the moment but life got in the way this weekend.  We'll continue as scheduled on wednesday with a post.  Again I'm sorry I had something big come up :(.",,False,self,t5_2rron,1366633758.0,,HAMMERU,True,t3_1cmcey,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1cmcey/monster_hunter_3_u_meet_reddit_sundays_wiiu/,moderator

I'm still in LR and I somehow decided that I wanted to make the LR Rathian armor, I don't really have a reason for it, I just felt like having it and so I went and killed Rathian a few times. It was great, I've got everything I needed except a Rath Marrow.

Fast forward five freaking hours. Not a single marrow from my countless captures and tail carves, several plates. I decided to check the drop rates for it. 20%? Wait, I've gotten 5 plates with a drop rate of less than 5% and yet I haven't gotten a single marrow?

I lost count of how many times I captured her. Seriously, fuck you Rathian. Guess what? I'm going to farm the shit out of you for the next few hours, I'll never give in.

1341310355.0,27,self.MonsterHunter,vz0vn,Got a moment to listen to an excited newbie spin a tale?,Marzz,29,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/vz0vn/got_a_moment_to_listen_to_an_excited_newbie_spin/,"So I'm kind of a newb to the Monster Hunter series- I say kind of because I bought Tri on the Wii the day it came out, but didn't exactly make it very far- I made it about as far as Barroth, and didn't have time to play anymore really.

I picked up Freedom Unite for the PSP, and it seems like it's a much more in-depth experience than Tri is. I could be wrong but it just seems that things are a lot more complex. I don't know.

Anyway, I just had my first experience on MHFU that makes Monster Hunter what it is.

I'm working on the Village quests right now, 2 stars. I'm working on them one by one, because nothing really challenging has come up yet. Giadrome was pretty tough but mostly tough because I was wearing the starting armor set.

Anyway, I got my armor up, and thanks to some lucky mining and carves i've got level 4 Giaprey armor and Giaprey Blades + (the dual swords with ice properties). I feel like I'm unstoppable. My weapons are two-shotting Giapreys and Popos and one-hit-killing anything else, so I guess I'm feeling a little overconfident. I take the quest to kill the Yian Kut-Ku. I take 10 mega potions with me, and next to nothing else.  

Big mistake.

I grab the supply stuff, which was 3 mini whetstones, 3 first aids, a shock trap, 3 tranq bombs, 2 sonic bombs, and 2 rations.

Clearly that was not enough.

I engage YKK, and get him limping, but I'm almost out of potions, my stamina bar is dropping, and worst of all, my weapons are completely dull. What do I do? 

I decide to break combat with him and hope on a wing and a prayer that I can find something in the wild that can help me out.

Avoiding combat as best I can, I find the wandering elder guy- he gives me two Psychoserums and a special mushroom. At least those serums will help me find the YKK when I'm ready to do battle.

I scour the jungle walls looking for places to mine, hoping I can get a Whetstone- I've got one mega pickaxe and one old pickaxe in my bag. I find one- Disk stone... Disk stone... Earth crystal. Fuck. I look for another one. I find a place to mine in a cave with a couple of herbivores. Earth crystal.. disk stone.. WHETSTONE! I got one!! I keep mining there, but I get nothing else out of it, nor out of any other mining node in the entire jungle. 

I start rooting around in the ground for mushrooms and herbs, and luckily enough I found two herbs, two blue mushrooms, and two Honey. I mix up two mega potions, then hunt down those herbivores I saw earlier in the cave. I kill them and get some raw meat, cook it up, and bam, two well-done steaks. So I'm back at full health, full energy, and I've got ONE whetstone left. 

Let's do this.

I find YKK in an area with a bunch of Velociprey. He engages me, using his wing attack first- it kills all but one of the 'prey. I toss a sonic bomb at him- Direct hit. He screams, and I get a few good chops on him. I apparently weakened him enough to limp off- he flew away to his nest! I chase him down, and then the final battle starts. I drop my shock trap once I notice him limping again, and he gets snared in it. I toss my tranq bombs but it was a no go- I have to go into direct combat with him. My weapon's got two levels of sharpness left. He's limping around. I've got one health potion left- No, make that none, he got a lucky tail whip off. 

He charges at me, stumbles, I press R to go into my frenzy state with my dual swords. I land three solid hits, directly to his head. 

Mission cleared.

Yian Kut Ku falls, and I've got a goofy fucking grin on my face.

I love this game so much.

The reward is a hammer that *heals!* [Majestic Scepter](http://i.imgur.com/XeCOTuH.jpg) has 1560 raw, no element, no affinity, no slots, loads of blue sharpness and a good chunk of white if you have Sharpness+1.

**Challenge Quest 9** *(Requires HR6, max participants: 2)* - Slay an Agnaktor and a Sand Barioth. Dust devils and laser beams, oh my! And not an Evade skill in sight. Your options are GS, SnS, lance, hammer and LBG. The good news is you only have to fight them one at a time. The bad news is that Agna is pretty big. Expect terrible fire resistance on the armor.

This is the second iteration of the “weekly stupid question thread” (Following the MH trend I’m tempted to name this thread “Weekly Stupid Question Thread Freedom”). Last week’s thread had a lot of responses and it seemed to be very beneficial, so I’ll continue.

 I’m sure many of you have developed some new questions after a week of having your grubby fingers on the game (as the large amount of new posts proves) – and I guarantee if you are curious about it then some other hunter out there is too. So with that said, have at ‘em boys. No question is too stupid (just varying degrees of stupid, but no one will judge).

Naturally I was spamming the thread with questions about Monster Hunter, and surprisingly I was not alone.  Wouldn't you know it, they answered the question.  Kind of.

Without giving concrete details, Svenson said there were things ""in the works"" regarding Monster Hunter, and that it has ""not seen the last of Western shores"".

I can only assume he is referring to Portable 3rd and/or it's HD PS3 port.  If you were thinking about importing, you may wanna wait a little longer.

As an exclusivity, this means that the only online community will be for the console I own, which means a greater pool of players with whom to play, whereas with MH3U I can't play online at all.

In the third generation of MH games Wii (Tri) and Wii U (MH3U) users have had the ""advantage"" so to speak, as those consoles have pretty much had a monopoly on online play. The whole point to buying a Wii U was, for many, the ability to play MH3U over the internet (as well as having nicer graphics, higher resolution, et cetera). 

Now, however, the 3DS will have the ability to play MH4 over the internet, which combined with MH4 being an exclusivity to that console, effectively removes any incentives for Monster Hunter fans to use their Wii U.

So, as Wii U users, how do you feel about MH4? Do you feel cheated that the console you bought specifically to play MH online won't have any new releases in that franchise? (For the time being)

A lot of people were complaining about the cameras and the controls. They seemed strange at first, but, just like dark souls, I was able to get them down with a little bit of practice. I began with a greatsword, and I think it's grown on me cause I love it. I tried lance and switch axe, but I still go back to the sword. Soon I felt relatively comfortable fighting the snow bunny thing, so I went to fight the pelican sloth in water fun world, which was just as awesome.

So that is a quick rundown of my short experience. Overall, even though the controls feel like something out of N64 era (no qualms here, loved the 64) they match the gameplay quite well, it forces you to put a lot of focus into movement, timing, and attacking, since all of those things combined are pretty difficult to a new player.

The graphics are no crysis, but they look very nice. The game has a great art style with tons of charm (I laugh every time my guy takes a nap).

So far the enemies and bosses have not been disappointing. They aren't quite like anything I've fought before, it presents a challenge that is quite different from your ""regular"" boss, even by dark souls standards. I guess endurance is key, I spent like 30 minutes fighting the pelican sloth. Can't wait to fight some of the (hopefully bigger) guys.

My one issue is that the game, even though at 60 fps, still looks a little jittery. Also, the invisible walls could use some work. I mean, I can understand for some things, but teasing me with a huge expanse of ocean and then blocking the thing off with a flat invisible wall? Don't do that to me man!

Overall, this game is a definite buy. It gives a ton of raw undistilled fun, not very common in games nowadays.  I'm looking forward to the crafting system and multiplayer that people love so much.

This video may not be the end-all, be-all, but I think it works pretty well.

I know we could have tested it on monsters with higher hp, but we thought the GJ would be good enough; as you can (hopefully) see, the only scaling is between Moga and Tanzia, not between player count or which version of Tanzia you're in.

As normal I saved and shut my 3DS. Slept like a baby. After a long day of work I thought ""what better way to celebrate the weekend than break the 100 hour mark?"" (I know it isn't a lot of time, but it was my time!). Go to play and my file was corrupt. Somehow between when I saved and shut my 3DS something happened to the file. While I know I don't have nearly as much time as the other hunters in the game 97 hours was a big deal for me. Please fellow hunters make sure you save properly, and make sure not to shut off your 3DS or Wii U early. Looks like I am starting over again.

**Where's the Uragaan!?** *(Requires HR6)* - Hunt an Uragaan and a Volvidon in the Land Arena. Simple enough quest, special reward this time is the Miniature Ticket, used to craft the SnS [Sanctioned Sword](http://u.jimdo.com/www44/o/sa2759b64d54f29f1/img/i93f928bbc80a81f9/1367933697/std/sanctioned-sword-attack-280-attribute-thunder-500-sharpness-white-sharpness-1-white-affinity-15-slots-1-rare-9.jpg) (Attack: 280, Attribute: Thunder 500, Sharpness: White (Sharpness+1: White), Affinity: 15%, Slots: 1, Rare 9)

**Challenge Quest 3 - ""Mark of the Hero""** *(Requires HR6)* - Hunt an Ivory Lagiacrus, Azure Rathalos, and a Brachydios in the Land Arena. No special rewards from this one, being an Arena quest.The monsters all come out in a set order, Ivory Lagi first, Azure Rathalos second, and finally Brachydios. Rewards Hunter King, Leviathan, Flying, and Brute coins.

Additionally we get two more titles this week, **Moga** and **Egg.**

Remember that these quests must be started from the tavern in Port Tanzia, and may be done either Solo or in Multiplayer.

When I play any game like this I tend to first find as many websites and resources as I can to try to pick apart the game and learn as much information as I can. 

Along with the Monster Hunter Wiki and the (I believe created by a Redditor from this board) amazing Mhpedia.com, I feel that I am leagues ahead of where I would have been without all the information. Thank you Monster Hunter community for being so strong and dedicated to fun. I've never gotten in to a game quite like this (including anything with coopertive multiplayer) so this is a really exciting step in my gaming habits.

I'm still a new hunter but I'd love to hunt with anyone to learn the game better. Add me on Nintendo Network with the ID ""WooperScooper"" if you care to! 

Two edits: First, I think there may be some bad grammatical errors there. It's late, I'm tired, I'm sorry.

Second, if anyone has any other wonderful reference sites to learn MH information, I would love to check them out! ",,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,SAU,True,t3_1buce0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1buce0/first_real_monster_hunter_and_im_loving_it_thanks/,
