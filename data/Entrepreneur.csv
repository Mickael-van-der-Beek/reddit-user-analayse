We both have had a lot of experience with using Alibaba for getting products manufactured. See Our success with Alibaba [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/18ctrk/how_i_made_my_first_20_with_alibaba_and_a_cotton/). We are thinking about making a course (free for Reddit of course) on the topic. We now distribute our product to large retailers and no longer do the hand to hand online. 

Would you guys be interested? **Yes=Up Vote  No=Down Vote**

Also let me know why you would or would not want the course. Cheers

------
**[Edit] it would be a full course that walks you through the process form a-z. Brainstorm, mock up, searching for manufacturer, prototypes, price negotiation, website build, to first sale**

[Update] A lot of you have said yes to this. I will be Setting up a site around this. I will create a list and update you as I progress with the course. I am in contact with the PR rep from Alibaba out of Hong Kong that interviewed me after my Alibaba Article got a bunch of attention. [Proof I am not B.s.ing](http://i.imgur.com/wZQ0I5N.png)

[UPDATE]Free registration is closed. You can RSVP for early bird access here http://antiwantrepreneur.com/alibaba-crash-course-rsvp/

**I will put the course on Udemy most likely. You are signing up for notifications of the course, thats all. You can unsub any time.**

**This  was a fucking good validation! Didn't know so many people wanted to learn how to use Alibaba**

**[Update] Over 450 redditors signed up so far. Awesome. I am outlining the course now. And will update you all. All those that signed up will get access to course for free. This is going to be awesome.

How I did it, and what's next!",localcasestudy,506,67,488,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/sblc6/from_an_idea_to_replacing_my_fulltime_salary_in_4/,"I'm a long time redditor, but wanted to keep my reddit life and my company life seperate, hence the throwaway.

I'll get right to it:

In October last year I was reading an article about a guy that started a cleaning company in his city and is now doing $150,000 per year. 

I work full-time, but figured, shoot, if he can pull that off, why can't I? 

I got to working in this order:

1) I drew up a quick marketing plan-literally one page in bullet form  
2) Had a website built that featured some of the ideas that I thought was most appealing about his site.  
3) Asked my home cleaner if she would take the jobs if I got any and she basically said ""hells yeah""  (I now have a total of 8 cleaners)  
4) I brushed up on my adwords (I had already owned an Adwords guide and had dabbled in adwords before for another local company)  
5) Started Twitter and Facebook page.  

All of this took like 3 weeks.

I launched the site on November 3rd and had the first job on the first day.  

By the end of November I made my first $1,000 profit, and now the site is doing $1,000 profit per week ($4,000 per month), which exceeds the take home pay from my full time job.

This post is two-fold.  To say,

1) This is not brain surgery and 
2) Don't overthink shit, sometimes just doing it is the only answer.

I'm just getting started with this and feel I could hit $10,000 per month profit in the next 4 or 5 months if things keep going like this. 

ASK ME ANYTHING!

Also, I feel like I can duplicate this success in another venture: Lawncare.  I plan to start a lawncare company (and by plan, I literally mean I'm going to get that bad boy jumping in the next two weeks) and I try to duplicate my success.

If you guys want to tag along for the ride I plan to document everything here and you can follow along.  I'll make everything super transparent, including money I make the entire thing.  

**Tl/dr I started a cleaning company that replaced my take home salary from my full time job in 4 months.  Now I'm going to try again with a lawn care company and I'll make the entire process super transparent if you guys are interested.**

Edit: I figured I would share the site: http://www.maidsinblack.com/

Edit: Here is where the lawn site follow along will take place: http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/ (Thanks to tabasquito for setting this up).  

Edit: It's amazing seeing folks come to the site from as far away as China, that's awesome!

Edit: Thanks to the redditor that emailed me through the site to verify that it was me! :-)

Edit: Folks, please don't book on the site (I mean, if you're in the DC area, that's all well and good and I'd appreciate it), but we're only in the DC Metro area! :-)  I'm seeing bookings from as far away as California and I have to email each and every one of you to say it's a no go! LOL  Thanks though.

**Final Edit: ** Thanks to all of you that asked such great questions.  I tried to answer as many of them as I could, I think I got well over 95% of them.  I ended up doing this to share my experience but got such great stuff out of this myself:
Thanks to the kind Redditor who runs an awesome company with 200 employees that offered to meet me for lunch next weekend to give me some ideas and just to shoot the breeze.
Thanks to the kind UK redditor that gave me tips about the site by email.
Thanks to the nice Chinese redditor that pm'd me.

Everyone, thanks this was fun: Follow along at **http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/** where I'll try to do this again over 90 days with a lawn company.  I have nothing to sell, no affiliate links, no products to push, no nothing.  It would just be a chance to see me try to do this again real time in detail.  Hopefully it will help some folks to get going to try something.  Life is short!  Thanks :-)

Wanted to share some thoughts.,robertgfthomas,389,55,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1fj8ru/i_sold_my_business_two_weeks_ago_after_starting/,"Hey, all. I'm Robin, [the Noteboard guy](http://www.thenoteboard.com), which I started at 23 years old in April of last year without having any interest in or intention of becoming an entrepreneur. (It was all largely thanks to Reddit). I sold the business two weeks ago for a tidy sum, never having had any investors, any debts, or any employees besides me. I learned a shit-ton in this past year, and after getting a bunch of questions via individual messages I figure just dropping a big mental dump could be valuable. Wall o' text time.

* Patents

People (especially on r/entrepreneur) stress out about patents all the goddamn time. I sure did. No matter how great your idea is, the odds of it getting stolen before it has a substantial market presence are very small. 

The corporations interested in stealing products have pretty much the same criteria as the ones interested in legitimately buying products: they want to invest as little risk and effort as possible and likely won't begin to consider anything that isn't already on the market with retail packaging and a track record of sales.

The best part for them is that if they just wait you'll do all the hard work for them: you'll keep developing and improving your idea, ironing out any kinks in the design, establishing a customer base, developing packaging, finding manufacturers and distributors, and so on. The person acquiring your idea wants to be able to leave all of your manufacturing/distribution/etc systems in place -- ideally they'd just sign some papers and start taking your revenue with no further work required.

Once you've got all these pieces in place **then** you can worry about theft/think about selling your product, and that's when patents become relevant.

But even then, as my patent attorney said, ""a patent is a blunt instrument"" -- no matter how rock-solid your patent is, it won't do anything unless you have the strength to do something with it. Intellectual property cases are incredibly expensive and laborious, and the ""thief"" will likely have attorneys who specialize in ""patent trolling"", meaning you might cough up an awful lot of money to defend your idea only to have it ""legally"" stolen.

Clearly the patent system is a crappy one. It was intended to favor the little guy, and has grown to work against him in almost every way.

(Un)fortunately patents are basically essential for the seal of approval they provide. Any corporation interested in buying or licensing your idea will likely require you to have one (because they can actually front the cash to defend a patent in court). Additionally, being able to say your product is ""patented"" or ""patent pending"" sounds good to customers (not necessarily for any good reason).

All-in-all, **get a provisional patent only once you've started actually selling your product in some kind of substantial quantity.** Then you'll have a year to decide whether or not you want to invest the several thousand dollars and several years required to get a patent application passed by the USPTO.

* Branding

However, you have a very valuable advantage over the Big Guys in that you're an underdog, and everyone loves an underdog. Don't underestimate the branding power of You.

If enough people come to see you as being someone who's honest, efficient, transparent, and committed to an idea, you'll be better-protected in many ways than if you had an iron-clad patent. This isn't idealism; it's solid, pragmatic, empirical advice. If a corporation steals your idea and you have a patent, then the best-case scenario is that you'll get a pile of damages fees in return for putting your business on hold for the several years you spend in court. If a corporation steals your idea and you have a strong emotional connection with your customers, then the best-case scenario is that your customers will do everything they can to build up your business and tear down the reputation of your competitor, both of which are gifts that keep on giving in your favor.

* Customer service

For this reason, the best thing you can possibly do for your fledgling business is to respond to customers as quickly as possible. This is simple and free and has amazing results. Make it your goal to respond to any incoming e-mails/phone calls within an hour of receiving them. If you get a query that you can't/don't want to answer, e-mail a response right away saying that you got their message and can't answer it right now but will as quickly as possible, and then just respond when you're able. My e-mail signature is, ""P.S. If you've been waiting for a response from me for more than 24 hours, please don't hesitate to contact me again. You're important!""

**In general, customers greatly prefer a mediocre (but friendly) response right away than a complete response slowly.** I cannot stress enough the importance of this.

* DIY-ish-ness

Running with the underdog idea, don't sell yourself short by thinking people will buy your product only if it comes in sexy packaging. If your product can be made with off-the-shelf pieces, then consider selling your product unassembled as a ""do it yourself"" kit. For example, if it's some kind of electronic device, get bulk orders of all the components, put enough in a Ziploc bag to make one, type up some instructions and toss them in the bag, and sell it that way. You might be surprised by how many people really like ""some assembly required"" products, and this is a great way to emphasize your underdoggishness while facilitating the creation of a community around your product as its users share tips for building and modifying it. People probably won't steal your idea — I made a point of making DIY instructions for Noteboards as widely-available as possible and it seemed to have the opposite effect.

* So there.

Bear in mind that I'm a 24 year-old with no business experience aside from this, no college degree, and no formal legal or financial expertise, so by all means take this with a grain of salt. That said I experienced a great amount of success with Noteboards, which may be luck but might also not.

As for what I'm doing now, the sale of the business gave me enough to be able to take at least a year to figure out exactly what I want to do next. This means I'll definitely be around to answer any questions, so feel free to holler. :)",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1370201935.0,,,True,t3_1fj8ru,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1fj8ru/i_sold_my_business_two_weeks_ago_after_starting/,

Texts.com is hiring campus presidents - details inside!,peaches017,336,99,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1jkk9x/currently_in_college_join_the_fight_against/,"**BACKGROUND**

*The Problem*: Each semester, students spend hundreds of dollars on textbooks.  After using the book for a few months, they sell back to the same bookstore at a huge discount.  The bookstore re-shelves those books and sells them again at a huge markup - it's an inefficient system where bookstores win and students lose.

*The Solution*: Connect students to their classmates who have the books they want and want the books they have.  By removing the middleman cut, sellers will earn much more while still providing buyers a discount.

**ABOUT US**

We are a team of two redditors (my partner is /u/bhalp1) and 2012 grads who met on /r/NYCjobs, saw a big problem, and are trying to fix it.

We built [Texts.com](http://www.Texts.com) to make it fast and easy to find the lowest possible price for textbooks.  We've done this by teaming up with Amazon, Chegg, and other affiliate partners, and also providing free student-to-student listings.  We do things our own way; for example, we launched our company by giving away 60 pizzas on 4/20 ([picture of the madness](http://i.imgur.com/br1g0XB.jpg)).

**ABOUT YOU**

You are a current college student that is frustrated with the broken market that forces students to overpay and then undersell.  You are entrepreneurial by nature; energetic, outgoing, and organized; and believe in the power of grassroots marketing and hustle.  You believe in our mission, and want to be part of the change.

**LOGISTICS**

*You will*:

* Build your own team, as big or small as makes sense
* Handle payments, delegate responsibilities, strategize on-campus marketing
* Direct our marketing dollars as you see fit (snacks, branded swag, etc.)
* Get fabulous entrepreneurial experience, and the unique opportunity to truly lead as you see fit
* Strengthen your selling skills; a tool that will serve you well in any career
* Help launch a disruptive startup - one that seeks to have a social impact by being lean, green, and relentlessly student-first
* Ensure that your campus peers get a fair price for their textbooks, both when buying and selling!


*We will*:

* Stay out of the way and trust you to manage your own campus strategy and execution
* Advise you when we can be helpful, by sharing best practices, specific tactics, etc.
* Fund your marketing needs and staff salaries
* Bolster your team with powerful tools to show off our technology and add books to the campus supply
* Provide entrepreneurial mentorship, connections, and references (especially to the NYC startup scene)
* Keep you on the short list for regional leadership positions going forward

**HOW DO I APPLY?**

All applications will be handled through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fOZULxZL_l3HmYm59wFXAS68EcYlZnpaKpWMGFMZc44/viewform).  You may also send me a PM here, or shoot an e-mail to Peter@Texts.com.  Lastly, feel free to post here and we'll do our best to answer any questions you have.

It has 73 paying customers, which generate a little over $2117 a month. Total revenue so far is $22,000 through pre-sales and monthly fees.

I got a new marketing job 7 months ago and learned about seo, buying ads, copy, etc so i decided to give it a shot again. 

I wrote some articles, did a simple design and got my [first sales last week](http://i.imgur.com/AVnZ4gH.png). 
All off of SEO. I didn't even know i got the sale because i wasn't pubbing the site seriously. I haven't done ads yet. 

Exciting. Gonna invest the $20 to get some articles written for the site and lets see if I can get more sales!

*[Edit] I am writing a blog post on how I went through the process of creating the product. Coming soon*

I'm now 22 years old and started a bit over 2 years ago.

 Absolutely everything in the sites and app is coded and designed, thought out, planned, etc. by me, so it's important I know what I'm doing and that I'm constantly learning. 
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
 

The first thing is an article and some slides which I found many months ago, it pretty much smacked me across the face, and is honestly the single most important thing I keep in mind now when I do anything on my sites.  

 Article:  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/technology/08class.html
 
Slides/audio: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/08/technology/210110508-Facebook.html?ref=technology 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
  
And the other thing I want to share is the only blog I read, but aside from that article above, the things I learned in this blog is easily the most important important thing I ever read.  

 It too hit me right across the face, made me realize what I was doing wrong, but also what I did right (without knowing at the time, purely by accident).   
 
And of course, now I dropped the things I did wrong and do more of the things I should do right, and the change on my sites and the users has been huge because of this (for the better, ofc!).

The url is: http://www.nirandfar.com/ 
  
  

Basically, read the articles and watch the videos in the ""Most Popular"" sidebar. Read the other articles too, it will take you quite some hours to get through everything, but you'll sit the entire time just amazed at what you have just read.

_____________________________
**1) Creative startup ideas and proposals**

•	Very undeveloped

•	Repetitive and unresearched (t-shirt company teenager asking Google-able questions)

•	Abundance of “idea men” vainly seeking technical partners

•	Major need for regional legal/licensing resources 

•	Many useless questions about how to make quick cash

_________________________________
**2) Case discussions of problems/feedback for existing startups**

•	Lack of expert answers

•	Encouraging presence of several dedicated community consultants
______________________________________
**3) Links to articles, blogs and advice**

•	Very spammy

•	Often unscientific and not actionable

I personally believe that this community is falling short of its potential. Reddit should have an amazing forum for entrepreneurs.

Hope you guys enjoy! Here is the link to the original article, but I know Reddit hates external links so I also added the list below...

***http://www.startupbros.com/need-motivation-nsfw-inspiration-guaranteed-to-make-you-cry/***

Level 1 - Standard Motivation

**[Never Quit, Persist!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eIsH2BqtAc)**

Short reminder for anybody considering giving up.

**[""I'm Mad As Hell!""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNxoLJy3m3s)**

Classic that always gets me fired up.

**[Will Smith's Secrets to Success](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpQb9OFPFg)**

Great montage of Will Smith's speeches on success.

**[Motivational Montage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgmVOuLgFB0)**

Awesome motivational montage.

Level 2 - Tear-Jerk Inspiration

**[Bill Mills Great Olympic Upset](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5vOhMwRQwI)**

Like clockwork, I always tear up when seeing Bill Mills come out of nowhere for the win. Hearing his story is chilling.

**[Derek Redmond Olympic Perseverance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZlXWp6vFdE)**

Despite tearing his hamstring, Derek Redmond finishes his race with the help of his Father. A powerful demonstration in perseverance.

**[How Bad Do You Want It?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZnCGyPneo)**

Powerful video filled with lessons for success. Success is intentional and deliberate. Make the choice and never stop pushing.

**[Take It To The Next Level](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZA-57h64kE)**

A point-of-view journey from newbie to pro. Though this is about soccer, I think it can help anybody.

Level 3 - Life Changers You'll Never Forget

**[The Deathcrawl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSM1mvMypWU)**

The best motivational video I've ever seen. Pure motivation right here. A powerful lesson in believing in yourself.

**[Autistic Basketball Player Scores Like Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZtU676jA_k)**

This is one of the most inspirational things I've ever seen. An autistic basketball player is finally given the chance, and completely dominates. The crowd erupt in pandemonium after this kid is done putting on a show.

**[Father and Son Marathon Team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xtCFRYS-ZA)**

The story of a Father who would do anything for his Son, and a reminder that anything is possible if you work hard enough.

**[Don't You Dare Waste Your F*cking Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rRwaPkfwo4)**

Absolutely the most powerful video I've ever seen. This video has changed my life multiple times over.

$25 - 50 pack of tri-color 24"" glow necklaces.
2x$12.99 - 40 pack of dual color bendable glow bracelets (80 total)
3x$10.60 - 6 pack of 14"" led color changing hair barrettes.

Spent another $6 on a pair of LED flashing nerd glasses for myself and $12 on pvc pipe and cap to hold the necklaces. 

Selling necklaces and bracelets got $3 or 2 for $5. If i sell all of them one at a time I would gross $390. Selling them all 2 at a time will gross $245. 

Led barrettes will be $6 or 2 for $10. Gross will be between $90 - $108. 

I'll update on my success tonight as well as after tomorrow night if I don't sell out tonight. I plan to adjust the pricing as needed but plan to stand firm tonight. If all goes well I plan on importing direct from the manufacturer for the next event and increasing my profit margin.

AMA about Company Formation",papajohn56,206,28,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/vuqrk/there_appears_to_be_some_confusion_here_about/,"So many people in here keep spouting out ""Delaware LLC bro"" and whatnot without realizing the pitfalls and benefits to certain formation styles, so here are the basics:

- **Sole Proprietor**:  The most basic of businesses.  Not incorporated, no civil liability shield or tax benefits.  If someone sues the business they are suing you and you can literally lose everything.  Can use a DBA or your own name.

- **LLC**:  Limited Liability Company.  A newer type of entity that came into existence in the 1980s in the US based on the GmbH in Germany.  These offer the simplicity of a sole proprietorship or partnership when it comes to paperwork, with civil liability protection and the ability to shield the members from lawsuits.  LLCs do not have shareholders, they have members, which are outlined in the operating agreement.  LLCs can also elect to be taxed as S-corporations or C-corporations if they so choose.  Classified as ""self-employed"" typically for small businesses.  LLCs are often used by larger companies as liability shields as well.  See Walmart for example.  Walmart Inc. has a wholly owned subsidiary, ""Walmart Transportation"" which is their trucking and shipping of goods.  This shields the parent company without incurring additional tax issues.  Members are not required to be US citizens.  May be owned by a corporation.

- **S-Corporation**: A ""small business"" corporation.  Pre-dates the LLC, but newer than the ""old fashioned"" corporation.  Offers civil liability protection like an LLC, but has more paperwork (annual meeting, minutes, share issuance etc).  Must have a board of directors, even if one person acts as the entire board.  Requires even the owners be on payroll.  Shares are issued rather than membership.  These are beneficial for tax reasons often as small businesses can avoid higher FICA taxation by paying themselves a lower salary and taking the rest as a profit.  Can have up to 99 shareholders, and shareholders *must* be US citizens.  Corporate shareholders and partnerships are generally excluded. However, certain trusts, estates, and tax-exempt corporations, notably 501(c)(3) corporations, are permitted to be shareholders

- **C-Corporation**:  The big boys or people seeking VC/Angel investment typically.  The most paperwork requirements, much more filing and accounting work.  You are no longer self-employed at this level, you are an employee of Whatever Inc.  Double taxed - this is where the corporate tax comes into play.  May have unlimited shareholders and shareholders are not required to be US citizens.

- **LLP**:  Typically used by law firms, architectural firms, etc, Limited Liability Partnerships shield partners from the negligence or civil issues of the other partners.  Similar to an LLC in a way, but the entire LLC would be held liable whereas a specific partner can be liable in an LLP.

- **PLLC**:  Professional LLC.  Specifically for doctors, lawyers, accountants, and other professionally licensed firms.  This is like a normal LLC, but allows professional licensure to be granted to the LLC itself.  Many states will require a PLLC be used if a company is formed for these purposes.  There are also PLLPs in some states which basically combine LLP/PLLC.

--------------------------------

**What are the benefits to specific states?**

A lot of people love to puppet Delaware around because they know major corporations use it for a reason, but those reasons will not benefit your little single member LLC at all.

- **Delaware**:  Good for C-corps.  Has the chancery court and no state-level income tax is leveed on companies.  There are high fees for compliance, however.  Anything other than a C-corp intending to get very large, go public, or seek VC serves no purpose to form in Delaware and you are wasting your money.

- **Nevada**:  Relatively cheap.  Easy to file in, good privacy protections in place.  Fast filing (less than 1 week from time of filing online to entity formation).  Nevada does not share information with other states on revenues, banking and other company issues, so take that as you will.

- **Wyoming**: Up and coming!  All the same as Nevada, but cheaper!

- **Alaska**:  Are you a high credit business for whatever reason?  Alaska may be your best bet.  Alaska companies receive extra protection from creditors.  Companies may not be dissolved in state courts due to unpaid debts like they can in other states.  Companies that finance their receivables may find this useful if shit hits the fan.

- **Your Home State**: 9 times out of 10 for the small business, this is your best bet with an LLC.  Why?  Because having an out of state company means you will have to file as a foreign entity in your state of operations, which will incur you another filing fee and extra headaches.  Unless your accountant or lawyer has recommended otherwise for tax or liability reasons.

--------------------------------

**Should I go offshore?**

99% of the time I will say no.  There are plenty of benefits to offshoring however that don't involve dodging your taxes.  Here's an example:

- Bob owns a very successful business, and profits millions per year.  Unfortunately his relationship with his wife is rocky, and she plans to file for divorce and will try to ""take him to the cleaners"".  If Bob has an offshore trust and LLC set up to hold his funds (and complies with tax law), her attempt to sue him for funds will most likely fail.  If set up properly, the judge can demand Bob get money out of his offshore accounts.  Bob can agree to try, but *his own trust* can deny him access for this reason if set up correctly, making it impossible for the now ex-wife to claim any of his assets.

Here is what I propose as an example...

Lets say you have a great product, you either make it your self or you have a great supplier in the US. That product isnt available here in the UK, Ill buy that product from you an import to the UK. Or you're looking for tradtionally made British goods thats hard to find in the US I will export it to you so you can sell.

We basically have a network of motivated individuals willing to work hard and everyone is asking, ""how do I make money"" ""how do I find the next big thing"" lets use this community to build some business relationships up and start making a tidy profit from using great products from our countries. Of course UK/US as just an example what about the guys here from China or Germany or well anywhere. 

Lets get a discussion going if it picks up lets start a subreddit of suppliers from around the world and build a network to help one another, boom profit! Or something like that.


Edit:

In response to everyone making some great connections on here and some really good conversations today I have set up /r/EntrepreneurConnect so everyone can keep the discussion going. Please feel free to post products and services or skills you have on offer or great suppliers you have, products you need anything really. 

I will post some updates on the subreddit too in regards to the new connections I have made hopefully to motivate a few more connections being made.

1372591385.0,167,self.Entrepreneur,1hczgc,Here are some good tips on how to make money in college,AntiWantrepreneur,203,36,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hczgc/here_are_some_good_tips_on_how_to_make_money_in/,"If you are a college student, it is highly likely that you are broke. College is the place to learn, grow, drink a lot of beer, and have more late night relations with the oppositie sex than you can count. But, many people don’t realize how much money you can make in college.

Think about this. You are in college, a place with people from all around the world. The different schools within your college are like different niches. The clubs and student organizations are like subniches. What if you can sell something that these groups need? Maybe you can sell information, a product, or services?

Here are 7 things you can do now to start formulating those ideas:

1. Learn how to turn $0 into $10
For example, go to the classified ads section on Craigslist, or a job board on campus. A lot of people post services they need. Make a list of the most common ones, and create your own ad offering that service for a lower price. If you start getting customers, you can raise the price.

2. Survey the campus
Go to the student group meetups on campus. There are groups for EVERYTHING. For example, check out http://studentgroups.fsu.edu/organizations. 
Survey these organizations and find a problem area within the organization. What do they need? What are they lacking? Photography? Website? T-shirts? Find it, expose it, and provide a solution. Set up contracts and have reoccurring revenue coming in.

3. Take risks
Do not be a wantrepreneur. You need to take some risks. Don’t spend 3 years pretending to be an entrepreneur. Start small, and gradually build your entrepreneur muscle. Soon, you will become known on campus. Once this happens, you will probably gain the confidence to start expanding off-campus, and making more connections and deals.
Stop writing business plans. Stop making business cards. Start focusing on the needs of the potential customers around you.

4. Grab a beer with your business professor
Well, maybe not a beer, but do something to get on their good side. College business professors have a lot of experience. A fair amount of them have businesses or have had businesses.
Ask them to be your mentor, and you be a great mentee. Pick their brains and offer your services to them. Use their advice and let them know how much they have helped you.

5. Use school resources
Become friendly with the marketing, web design, advertising and art departments. These guys can be crucial in getting you free promotions.
Try to land a part-time gig in the publications office. You will have free access to all their equipment, which could help cut your overhead costs.

6. Interview people
This doesn’t just apply to college students. Everyone can do this.
Think about it like this…You want to do something that you have never done before. What is the fastest way to learn and avoid mistakes? Ask the people that have done it before you. You are not the first person to have a business in college and you certainly won’t be the last.
The interviews can be in any medium – email, in person, Skype, or written message (this works very well!). Make sure you listen more than you speak. The following are some questions you could ask:

* How did you start?
* What obstacles did you overcome?
* How did you use your network?
* What ideas did you consider but reject, and why?
* Who is your target market?
* What were some of the main tipping points (if any) or “A-ha!” moments? How did they come about?
* What is your most memorable moment, good or bad?
* What resources or tools did you find most helpful when you were getting started?
* What were your biggest mistakes, or biggest wastes of time/money?
* Any key PR wins? Media, well-known users, or company partnerships, etc.? How did they happen?
* Do you outsource any parts of your business? If so, with who?
* If you were to do it all over again, what would you do differently?

Seven. Have fun
Don’t forget you are in college. Have fun and make money. Your college years are some of the best years of your life.

I needed the money badly as I had just dropped out of college, had $0 to my name, and was driving a ‘92 Civic with no AC and non-working windows (HOT as hell)! Over 3.5 years I worked my way up to manager and ran the entire company even though my pay never reflected my responsibilities. Towards the end of my employment, the company started doing very poorly and the owner fell into a depression where he wouldn't even come into work.

The company was failing because the owner had given up. He had also forgotten about his right hand man who had nowhere to work and no school experience. I got tired of being mistreated and being taken for granted so one day I put my foot down and told him I quit. I took all the knowledge I had attained and I went on to start my own Food Distribution Company with an investment from a friend who owns a larger, similar company in Arkansas. 

There were some tough times but I’m in my third year in business and I've never looked back. I've grown my company quarter after quarter. In fact, my company has surpassed my original employee’s sales half way through my 2nd year. 
These days I’m happier than ever and living the life I WISH I could have when I was younger. The craziest part is, it’s only the beginning for me, I’m 25 years old and I have A LOT left to do in life.

1352474780.0,169,self.Entrepreneur,12wzbj,"A word on ""Passive Income""",,209,40,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/12wzbj/a_word_on_passive_income/,"There seems to be confusion with what ""passive income"" means, especially with newer entrepreneurs just starting out and trying to find an idea. I thought I'd chime in. 

Passive Income DOES NOT mean ""money in exchange for no work"". It also doesn't mean a bit of work up-front followed by easy street. 

What it DOES MEAN is a business that provides you income while you are not actively working. It is the separation of time and money.

If you open up a food truck, your income is DIRECTLY tied to the hours you work. If you close for two weeks you will make zero dollars in those two weeks. This is an active business. You are a cog, not an operator. You may be the biggest cog in a machine but the machine does not run without you. 

Now take an e-commerce website (the most common example). You will get paid when someone places an order at 4am while you sleep. You will get paid while on vacation with your kids. You will get paid when you are having sex with your wife. 

Now, that e-commerce website doesn't just generate sales by itself. It is a machine you need to constantly keep well oiled and filled with gas. It takes a long time to build this machine in the first place and takes a lot of attention to keep running. It is NOT A NO-WORK BUSINESS. The machine will run while you are away but you need to follow a rigorous maintenance schedule or it will break down and die. SEO, marketing, handling complaints, returns, manufacturer issues, backorders, competition, market trends, blog posts, website tweaks, etc... You can merely choose to do this at 4am, on weekends, weekly in mass chunks or a little bit daily. You gain freedom in the form of choosing your own hours, not the freedom from putting in any hours. 

Passive income is merely the difference between working ON a business and working IN a business. It is not free money. ",,False,self,t5_2qldo,False,,,True,t3_12wzbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/12wzbj/a_word_on_passive_income/,

I’m sure this is a passion you share with me.  Since before I can remember, I’ve wanted to launch my own company.  I’m 23 and now I’ve finally done it.

I went through a process of identifying various niches.  My criteria for the business was something that could be mostly automated in a growing market which lacked innovation.

It has not been an easy process!  I had to overcome certain hurdles such as raising an initial (albeit small) amount of funding.  Sourcing my stock (luxury Japanese green tea) involved trying well over 100 samples until I found one that tasted truly great.

We just started selling in a couple of stores last year to gain traction (my business partner owns a restaurant and we sold a fair amount through there).  In summer 2012, we also won an award for the quality of the product (Great Taste Award gold star).

We’ve just launched our online selling.  Our next step is to really ramp up the online trade and that’s where I would love your feedback and any advice please.

Everything I've done has been commission based, I'd say 95%  of my clients I've attained through cold calling(locally and out of state).  First started working in the financial industry and then figured I might as well try cold calling other services/products to see if it would work.  I've run two other businesses that were both built from $0 in funding/capital to a six figure a year income.

Since then I've focused on my current business which is Web dev/Online Marketing and again started from scratch and built up through cold calling.

I feel like it gets a bad rap pretty much everywhere, but if you do it right, it's one of the most efficient ways to start up and grow a business. 

So basically, just wanted to gauge the interest of fellow business owners/entrepreneurs here on Reddit and see if you guys would be interested in something like this.  

**EDIT:  For those that are interested, if you could give me some examples of businesses you're interested in starting or currently working in, I'd love to give examples on the way I'd approach it.  PM me or just let me know in your comment so I can get some examples ready**

1372376263.0,153,self.Entrepreneur,1h7oti,My experience with blogging as a business and micro-enterprise -- 6 months in.,spacerocks_,173,20,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1h7oti/my_experience_with_blogging_as_a_business_and/,"Hi everyone,

My day job is helping to run a company that provides transcription services for Deaf people ([Link](http://intellitext-nv.com/)). The company is doing fine and the work is gratifying, but the downside of my job is that the income fluctuates heavily throughout the year due to school semesters and I move around the country a lot. I needed to find a small business that I could do remotely and on my own time.

None of this is conclusive, prescriptive, or in any way meant to show how cool and successful I am at blogging -- I am not. I am a trained businessman, but this is my first experience with trying to make money from the internet alone. I am going to write a story about my experiences, create a rough roadmap of how to generate a little bit of income from blogging, and hopefully help or inspire some Redditors. 

**The challenge: How can I make money on the internet?** 

In trying to make some cash, I looked at a lot of different options: 

* I considered trying to make instructional YouTube videos (how to tie a figure eight knot for climbing, etc.) and getting advertising revenue through that. I don’t have a high quality camera and I am not particularly photogenic, so I quickly ruled that out.  In retrospect, this might have been a good choice. I may one day pursue this avenue. 

* I thought about making an ecommerce store. I researched this heavily but the barriers to entry were pretty high and competition is fierce. I was intimidated by trying to have to form relationships with Chinese wholesalers and distributors. For this to work, I would have to find a niche, design an awesome Wordpress site, find a good dropshipper, and various other hurdles. This didn’t seem like a viable project for someone with my level of web design knowledge (read: none to speak of beyond basic HTML text formatting). 

* I applied to Scripted.com and passed their qualifying exams for Business and Sports writing. I have only ever received one offer from them, and it was rejected by their client.

* I even considered doing EBay resale; buying things at yard sales and thrift stores and reselling them, but this is so luck-based that it can’t really be a business; it’s just opportunism. My girlfriend is fairly successful doing this with designer shoes and purses; she has probably made a few hundred dollars in the last two months this way . . . That’s a story for another post.

So what could I do? Every post about making money on the internet says “generate high quality content first.” How does one do that when the internet is a big pile of voices all screaming over each other (“creating high quality content”)? I went to college for economics so my first thought was about value. How could I create value for other people?

**Leveraging my existing knowledge**

In my personal life, I am a rock climber. I decided to use my knowledge of the sport to generate content. I created a blog on Blogger.com in late December 2012 and began reviewing some rock climbing equipment that I had received for Christmas.  I began slowly; working hard to try to make the reviews funny, personable, and high quality. My first reviews were pretty overwrought but I was still experimenting with tone, interest, level of depth, SEO, etc. It probably took me 3 hours to write a good review with pictures and appropriate links. Now I can write one in about 1.5 hours. It’s pretty time-consuming, but I enjoy reading about rock climbing products and I am fairly knowledgeable about them, so it’s not particularly hard or tedious.

I eventually registered the domain http://www.ruggedinnovations.com through Blogger.com. It cost $10 for the year, so my blogging side hustle / business started out $10 in the red. So far, so bad! I had a friend of mine create the logo and splash at the top. I am not a designer or particularly good at this sort of thing, so the website hasn't really changed much since I first made it. 

**Revenue and monetization**

My traffic was very low at first; 1-4 page views per day. I applied for Google Adsense and was eventually accepted. I would look at Adsense dashboard every day and get depressed. I was probably making 5 cents a week off of this method. I also started trying to put affiliate links to the products I reviewed through Google Affiliates, but their only “outdoor” distributor was Campmor.com, and they very rarely had the esoteric rock climbing products I was talking about. 

I think I recently got an email that Google Affiliates is closing down -- I am not sure if that’s true, but I wouldn’t be surprised. Their selection of products, at least in my niche, was pathetic. I never made a cent from Google Affiliate links.

At some point I switched to Amazon Associates, and this ended up being a great idea. If you don’t know, Amazon Associates is a program in which you use their web interface to create a hyperlink to a product that is sold on Amazon.  When a person clicks on that link, their browser downloads a cookie that attributes all sales within 24 hours to your account and gives you a percentage of the sales.  The percentage of the sales is 4% for the first 10 products your account sells, and then the percentage increases afterwards. This is the same business model that websites like This Is Why I’m Broke use except they do it on such a large scale that I wouldn’t be surprised if they make a few hundred dollars per day. I am just a small fish compared to them but they are a good proof of concept that the business model is successful and scalable.

The really powerful thing about Amazon Associates is that people often click the rock climbing product links then browse around and end up buying something else! I would say probably 50% of my sales proceeds come from rock climbing-related products. It’s not a lot of money; but it has repaid my $10.00 investment so far. Just today I sold a pair of prAna women’s pants. Here’s a screenshot of what a daily report looks like: http://i.imgur.com/J5utzDL.jpg. 

Here is a screenshot of my Q1 2013 revenue from Amazon Associates and the various products I sold: http://i.imgur.com/aZQi30S.jpg 

And here's a screenshot of the month of June's affiliate sales and some conversion data: http://i.imgur.com/b8jYkOp.jpg

**Getting traffic** 

I made Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter accounts for Rugged Innovations as well. I invited all my personal friends to “Like” the Facebook page, but eventually realized that since very few of my friends are into rock climbing relative to my total friends count, all I was doing by linking the reviews was spamming their feed. Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter have not really ended up being worthwhile sources of page views -- at least not the way I was doing it. I think most of Rugged Innovations’ Twitter and Pinterest followers are bots. I’ve noticed that lots of people on Twitter will follow you just long enough for you to follow them back then they will unfollow you. 

A great source of traffic has been Reddit. I started creating posts and replying to people in the /r/climbing subreddit and have gotten a lot of traffic from that. My strategy with that isn’t to spam links to my blog at every opportunity but rather to attempt to answer people’s questions and start discussions in earnest. Blogger.com allows you to see “Traffic sources” under stats, and as you can see, a great deal of my views have been through Reddit. I respond to people’s questions in the subreddit and add a link to my blog post if it’s appropriate.  For example, if someone posts about post-workout recovery techniques for rock climbing, I would respond to the question and then add that I’ve written a blog post that addresses that question in detail and then link to it.  The main problem is that the informational posts I make on Reddit very rarely have affiliate links on them, so they are not great sources of revenue. One of my most successful posts on Reddit has [only one affiliate link](http://www.ruggedinnovations.com/2013/02/recovery-for-rock-climbers-live-to.html). My limited understanding of SEO is that having more page views makes you more “relevant” to search engine spiders, so even though I am not getting revenue for these posts, the increased traffic makes my other content more likely to show up in searches. Here’s a screenshot of my web traffic: http://i.imgur.com/rFLKNnW.jpg 

Another big source of traffic is Google searches. A lot of people find my site from typing “[product name] review” into Google.  I make sure to include lots of competing products on my review pages -- this has the added advantage of letting me put more affiliate links on my page. There is a surprising amount of traffic from sources outside the US, for example, I get a lot of traffic from people using the Google UK and Google Denmark. Not sure why! As I got better at writing and learned more about SEO, I found ways to improve my rankings in searches. Now I show up in the top 5 results if you search for ""[product name] review"". 

Amazon Associates and Google Adsense both have rules against asking people to click your links deliberately or trying to trick people into click your links (for example, by including a picture link so close to another element that people mis-click onto it), so that’s something to be aware of. For example, I would break the terms of service if I asked you to click an Amazon link on my page. I am not sure about grey areas here. For example, if a friend of mine asked me what my favorite videogame is, would it be breaking the terms of service for me to reply with an associate’s referral link to the game in question?  Feel free to chime in if you are familiar with this stuff. 

**What have I learned from all this?** 

First of all, writing high quality content is time-consuming and not rewarding in the short run. In 6 months of writing, I have probably generated about $40.00 from a combination of Google Adsense and Amazon Associates. I have probably spent 200+ hours on the project so far.  I find the writing personally rewarding given my hobby of rock climbing, so it did not really feel like work. However, if I had dedicated myself to something else in that time, I could have made a lot more money. That said, my old blog posts are still getting page views from Google searches and generating advertising and affiliate sales revenue. This means that as I write more articles I will generate revenue non-linearly.  I started making about 5-20 cents a month, and now I am making about $20 per month.  As of writing, I have received one Amazon Payments disbursement for $11.23. It’s not easy, fast, or particularly lucrative. It has been fairly fun to write about something I love and generate a small amount of revenue from it. As I continue to write, I will generate increasing amounts of revenue. Old posts are a source of “passive income” in that they do not require my input to make me money. I can forget about this blog for 6 months and still be making money from it. 

**What’s the next step?**

I’ve started being contacted by outdoor PR companies and have started talking to them. Their business model involves forming relationships with equipment manufacturers who send them trial products. The PR companies then distribute these trials to reviewers and bloggers who talk about the products and try to generate grassroots sales. I’ll update this post if any of those relationships with PR companies work out. I am not sure if my having a relationship with a PR company creates a conflict of interest as far as my neutrality towards products, but I think most people handle this by offering a statement of full disclosure on their page. I’ll have to think about that if the issue ever arises.

While we’re on the topic of full disclosure: by writing this post I will probably get a few hundred page views on my website and probably generate a small amount of advertising revenue; in any event, my experience with Reddit traffic and posts of this nature is that it will not generate more than 40-50 cents.  This post has taken roughly 3 hours to write.  You can do some quick math to see this has not been a particularly lucrative afternoon for me. Nonetheless, I have learned a lot from /r/entrepreneur and /r/smallbusiness and I would like to give back in a small way. 

So there you have it, guys. 

I am happy to answer any questions or provide specific instruction if there’s anything I can help you guys with!

If you have any feedback about my site or any suggestions about how to improve it and make more money, I’d love to hear them! Once again, here's my site: http://www.ruggedinnovations.com. I am always looking for ways to improve.

We use to be ""big"" (good revenue) and have around 15 employees. Today we have around 5 employees, we are struggling to survive and they hate us.

My mom talks to them as if they were her friend, laugh with them, we treat them well, spoil them by giving them company freebies. We always encourage and say that their poorly made work is okay, and go on to teach them how to do even better (then they go and leave us for a better company). Sometimes my dad had to work on New Years because the employees didn't even care to finish the work.


It's not the first time that we've had this issue, one of them starts revolting agains't us for some reason that is completely mysterious to us. Recently we put keyloggers on computers and started monitoring what they were doing. Turns our they were saying really bad things about us on facebook to each other. Like how they have the superior knowledge to save us and transform the business into a really profitable one, but we don't deserve it. Or how my dad or my brother are a joke. That the company is going down and that we were dragging them down with us. How this one employee was proud that he stole the company's laptop and was using it for his own business (we recovered it). They laughed as they told each other how they almost never work and what idiots we are.


It hurts to know things like this when you do nothing but treat them kindly. 


We never had a manager and to be honest we don't invest properly. We were paying three figures for a woman who was doing virtually nothing but laughing her ass off about how dumb we are.

****

How do you manage employees properly? Should we invest in a manager?

Should we inform them that we're monitoring them closely and even install a camera on the room to see what they do?

How would you approach this?

Made it all into one list, so it's easier to remind myself of what I want to become/be.

- Wake up early. Do something you love.- Eat a healthy breakfast. 

- Be positive and keep a positive attitude. Just try to stay focused on the positive and be optimistic about what the future has in store for you.

- Exercise. Get in shape. 

- Simplify. Minimize the material distractions of your life so you have more time to focus on what you really value.

- Turn off the TV. And the computer. And your cell phone. Disconnect from the imaginary world of pixels and binary. Disconnect and reconnect.

- Surround Yourself with Successful People. You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.

- Don't procrastinate. You'll never know if there is a tomorrow. Get it done now!

- Expose yourself daily to visual pictures of your goals. Every night before you sleep, take a look at pictures of your goals seeing these dreams already being achieved in your mind.

- Achieve your goals by keeping your mouth shut. Psychology tests have proven that when you tell someone your goal, and they acknowledge it, you are less likely to do the work to realize that goal. 

- Smile to improve your mood. Try this the next time you are in a bad mood: Instead of frowning, which reinforces a negative mood, consider smiling. Research has shown that by doing so, you are likely to experience a more positive mood.

- Be Worldly. The successful man makes the effort to know what's happening in the world around him. He has informed opinions about current events and can engage intelligent people in friendly discussions.

- Know About Life's Finer Things. Your knowledge of the finer things shows class and culture. It shows that you can be a peer among statesmen and business leaders. I recommend that you familiarize yourself with food, wine, cigars, art, and literature.

- Have good manners. People do notice these little things and will give you the props you deserve.

- Make public speeches. A good speaker is rare, and therefore always admired for his confidence and ease.

- Keep a network of contacts. The more people you know, the more good opportunities will present themselves.

- Travel. This is about broadening your horizons by going someplace different. When you travel, it shows that you're curious about the world and that you want to soak in other cultures.

- Dress well. Here are the basics: Dress sharply in contemporary styles. Groom yourself well and have a clean shave. Smell nice, but not too strong.

- Reality spin. When habitually put a negative emotional spin on objective facts, it's like piling weights on your shoulder before a footrace. By contrast, if you put a positive emotion spin on those same facts, you'll be freer to see opportunities and possibilities that others might miss.

- Get your priorities right. Its all about making intelligent choices, deciding what goals to pursue in which order, which takes vision and foresight.

- Use your resources wisely. While shopping, think: Do I need this piece of merchandise? Is the price right? Is this merchandise the best use of my money?

- Examine life, engage life with vengeance; always search for new pleasures and new destines to reach with your mind. 

- Worry only about the things that are in your control. The things that can be influenced and changed by your actions, not about the things that are beyond your capacity to direct or alter. 

- Be a responsible human being. Approach yourself with honesty and thoroughness; maintain a kind of spiritual hygiene; stop the blame-shifting for your errors and shortcomings.

- Go for it. There will never be a better time in your life to live your dream of entrepreneurship.  Swing for the fences with a goal to add your name to the prestigious list above. If you fail, it will have been one of the best learning experiences of your life.

- Dream big, act bigger. Your dreams are yours to make a reality, and not for others to live, so why allow anyone to ever stop you from anything you believe you can do? Your dreams are only as good as the actions you are going to take to make them a reality. Remember to dream big no matter what others have to say or believe, and ensure you work each and every day to live the life you want, not the one you have to.

Forget the business plan, the inspirational movies, favorite books, LLC vs Corp debate, etc.  They're excuses for inaction.  Unless you're already out there hitting the payment these things are just mental masturbation.  Don't ask me if I think your business idea will work.  My opinion doesn't matter.  Get the hell out there and sell--you'll get your answer.  

Being an entrepreneur is about putting your ass on the line and risking failure.  You will make countless mistakes and will fail over and over again.  You learn and you move on.  Eventually you start making more right choices than wrong ones.  This is a painful, stressful, and sometimes heart-wrenching process--but ultimately it's a necessary one.  You cannot navel-gaze from behind a keyboard and expect to anticipate the challenges that you'll face.  Don't fall into the trap of believing that your intelligence will allow you to formulate an impeccable plan that ensures your success.  It doesn't work that way.

Every morning that I wake up, my only goal is to a) survive until tomorrow and b) be a little bit smarter than I was yesterday.

**Prequel**

I was in between student jobs in April this year, and decided to use the free month I had to do something useful: Learn how to code, more specifically, learn how to build iOS applications. I'm not going go to into to much technical depth here, but when starting, I knew some PHP (and of course the usual HMTL/CSS stuff), and had a general idea of how programming worked - but no idea about Objective-C whatsoever. And it looked extremely hard. I was always fascinated with apps and decided that if other people can build them, why shouldn't I. Also, I had already paid some money for others to built an app for me, and was kind of pissed I wasn't able to work on it any further. The great thing now was, I already had an idea what (real) problem my app should solve: Making Instagram fashion-content shoppable easily. I always find it way easier to work on a project when learning something, sure that's not the optimal way, but it tends to keep me going. So here I was, ready to dedicate a whole month to building fashion.gram - the app that would allow 14-20 year old girls to shop popular fashion from Instagram.

**Coding the app**

I first started my journey by watching some free tutorials on YouTube, but quickly realized those come with a couple of problems. They aren't structured in any way, some of them are old and use deprecated code, or outdated versions of XCode. So that did not help. At all. I had heard about Treehouse before and checked out some of their free stuff, so I decided to sign up for a paid account, which turned out to be a great decision. Luckily for me, they have a tutorial which teaches you to build a blog reader, an (very very simple) app which pretty much has the same core functionality than what I tried to build. I don't want to turn this into an advertorial for them, but I found their videos to be extremely helpful and well structured. 

So there I was, spending my days and nights coding, Googling error messages, reading solutions on StackOverflow, or stopping myself from punching my screen after my build crashed in the simulator once again (it always happened for no reason obviously). After about 15 days, I had built what I considered my MVP. From a technical standpoint, it included the Instagram API, my own - simply structured - MySQL database + JSON-representation of it, a PHP backend for adding content manually, as well as the app front end. That's it. If you do not count in StackOverflow answers, I did all the coding and designing work myself. I knew some features were missing, but that did not really matter too much, I wanted to get this thing out as quickly as possible - and so I did.

[Here are some early screenshots of the app](http://imgur.com/a/jaGpQ#0). Not sure if this is version 1.0 or 1.1, but I don't think that really matters.

**First days in the app store**

I had previously launched an app in the app store (the one I paid someone else to build it), but it was only available in the DACH region (Which is Germany, Austria and Switzerland), and only received a couple of downloads, maybe about 30-50 a month. I just checked iTunes Connect - fashion.gram got 881 downloads in its first month. 881. With no marketing efforts whatsoever. I had a couple of reporting metrics built in, and they were showing real numbers. People were clicking on products. People were actually using what I had built. Sure, it wasn't the greatest app ever, but it did what it was designed to. I was super excited. On top of that, a week after, I received my first review. 5 stars. And it wasn't even one of my friends. It read ""Seriously, anytime I see something on IG that I want, it's hard to go fishing for the product"". So not only did someone like what I had built, they also validated I was solving a real problem. Sure, that's only one person speaking, but then again, it got me motivated to continue.

In the next couple of weeks, I added more features, like showing related products (here's a secret for you: it just shows 6 more products from the same category - but don't tell anyone), double-tap to shop (I don't think anyone uses this, but since Instagram is ""double tap to like"", I wanted to make my app ""double tap to shop"" - it's actually my favourite feature), added some more metrics (stream-views, CTR to shops), and optimized some things here and there. I was still looking not to add to much stuff, since I wanted to keep the core user experience clean and extremely simple.


**Marketing &amp; PR**

Up to this point, I still haven't done any marketing (as in ""spent money to promote my application""). The app has sharing features built in (Twitter, FB, Mail), but I rarely see one of my pre-set tweets on Twitter. I actually got lucky and found an Android developer through a friend of a friend who is currently coding a version for Android phones and tablets (simply because he liked me, and he liked the product). After he finishes his work - which should be some time next week - I will start spending money on advertisement, and I think I have figured out a channel where this is money spent well. Sorry reader, I will keep this secret for now.

In terms of PR. Well. I got a great review from thehighlow.com, but it was kind of hard getting in touch with other sites. I actually Googled similar apps, checked which outlets wrote articles about them, and then contacted them with my product/story. While I still think this is somewhat of a clever hack, the reality of limited media coverage tells me it isn't. But maybe this will work for you. I will try this again in the near future though. 

**TechCrunch Frontpage**

Speaking of hacks, here's the story about making the TechCrunch frontpage. It's kind of funny, a couple of days earlier I wrote a message to one of my friends (someone I consider a mentor) saying ""I want this on TechCrunch for vanity reasons"". I was pretty much kidding, since I'm really not the type of guy who needs ego boosts like that. So a couple of nights ago, I was about to go to sleep and decided to send out a tweet to Alexia Tsotsis. I knew she was the one writing articles on Instagram and apps for TC, and I kind of remembered she used to be a fashion blogger. So before turning off the lights (and my phone), I typed a tweet that goes ""@alexia as an ex fashion blogger, you should check out our app."", but clearly decided it needs to be a (tad) bit more edgy. Here's what I ended up tweeting: ""@alexia you might be a tad bit older than our regular users, but as an ex fashion blogger, you should check out our app."". Edgy yes, but to this point, I don't really think that's something someone (not even a woman) should take offence in. So a couple of minutes later, my phone vibrates, after @alexia responded to my tweet saying "".@fashiongram Worst pitch ever"". FYI, the ""."" in front of the @username means the tweet will not be considered part of a conversation and reach more people. And it did. The following minutes I received a ton of replies (mostly women), along the lines of ""PR you're doing it wrong."", ""#socialmediafail"", ""who tweets for fashiongram? #clueless"". I was amused, especially someone tweeting ""@alexia @fashiongramapp that's one way to get someone to totally ignore your app..."". If my app was being ignored, why are you and others talking about it? I would answer a couple of replies, and enjoy myself during my 15 minutes of internet fame.

I had gotten the attention I was looking for, by writing a single tweet. All these people telling me how horrible my PR was, while they were talking about my product. The product I had built a couple of days ago in order to learn how to code. Pretty ironic. A couple of minutes later, I saw that @alexia had written an article named [Startups, I Give Up On You For Today""](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/17/startups-i-give-up-on-you-for-today/) on TechCrunch. I clicked it on my phone - boom - a screenshot of my tweet made the TC frontpage. Please tell me again how I'm doing PR wrong, pretty girl on Twitter. As a sidenote, the article is in fact pretty horrible and should have never been published.

Of course (unfortunately) the article did not link to my app at all, and on top of that is somewhat negative, but I don't really understand, how people would consider it bad press. I had my personal triumph. I set out to having my logo on the TechCrunch front-page, and achieved that within a couple of days. I set a goal and achieved it. This is the way I am looking at it. ""Bad press"" - funny. As if someone is going to remember about this the next day, or even 10 minutes later. Maybe putting it into the headline baited you into reading this article, maybe I can use the story somewhere else. Who knows? Additionally, a start-up from the valley contacted me and wants to work with me after seeing my app, I might fly out to SF to meet with them in September. #socialmediawin!

In terms of numbers, nothing really happened. The visits to my website fashiogram.de skyrocketed from like 20 visitors a day to more than 600, but that does not really matter, since the download numbers for the actual app were not affected. I got like 5 more that day, yay me! So that's that.

**Status Quo**

I'm going to talk some numbers now. Since we started (as in ""since the tracking was added""), fashion.gram generated about 41.000 product views, with a CTR from product single view to store of &gt;6.5%. As someone who managed banner inventory on websites in the past, this is a mindblowing number. It means, we have referred more than 2500 potential customers to online stores. Until now, we have not used any affiliate links, so besides not having made a dime in revenue, we also don't know about the conversion rate, or how many leads/signups we generated for those shops. We are going to change this soon. Until yesterday morning, we had about 2,800 downloads, again, without any marketing spendings, which is decent number - at least I think it is. I have set up a company for this app - oh cool, I shall call this whole thing a ""Start-Up"" now - and the Android version is expected to be ready soon. It should have been ready a week ago, but the guy creating it told me ""weather was too nice last couple of days, did not get the finishing it"" - so that's pretty much how we look at this thing still.

**Learnings (no particular order and somewhat unrelated)**

1. It's super hard to actually get your app onto your phone to test it. Provisioning profiles and code-signing are terrible things.
2. Go do. Seriously. I see a lot of posts in this sub-reddit saying ""I got this idea"", ""I need a developer"" - go fucking do it yourself. The internet holds an insane amount of wisdom and Google will answer all your coding questions. If you really want it, you can get there. I can't stress this enough.
3. App Store marketing: Use plain screenshots of your app, using screens with marketing copy does not work. My organic downloads dropped significantly when I tried it.
4. Everybody will tell you this: Get something out quickly and reiterate after.

I have some experience on this (10 years online, a little more offline) so I thought I'd share. You can buy my eBook in... kidding!!!

**Is a long post (you may want to save it for later). You can TLDR at the end.** 


**Disclosure:** I have no affiliation with any of the tools I mention. I use them and I like them. Thats it. Read on:

This first post deals with **how to reach your market**.

If you're interested in a post about how to obtain basic market numbers (**S**ize of **T**otal **M**arket, **S**ize of **A**ddressable **M**arket and **S**hare **O**f **M**arket) let me know in the comments.

First: IMHO **the questions you want to answer are about 3 main subjects:**

- Your target market

- Your competitors

- The ""influencers"" of that market

And the questions are the same for all of them:

- Who

- What

- Where

(You can add How and When, but I want to keep this short and actionable)

**The best place to start are your competitors.** Why? *Because they already did the grunt work for you.*  

They are reaching the target market and they are already been discussed (knowingly or not) by the influencers of that market. 

**So, lets use a practical example.** Say you want to sell some funny t shirts. You want know: 

- **Who: Exactly who your biggest competitor are, ordered by traffic.** This also gives you insight on good design and usability practices, pricing, features (free shipping? one day delivery? your own designs? etc.)

- **What exactly are they doing to get that traffic:** Paid advertising? SEO? Social Media? Content Marketing? Is not the same for every industry. Ideally you want to do everything, but you have to start somewhere. **[As the guy who sold a piece of his company valuated in U$S 300.000.000 said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1fuege/after_7_years_of_hard_work_just_sold_our_company/):** 

&gt;The most important lesson we learned early on was to be very focused on the tactics that we decided to execute. In other words, my advice for a startup is to do fewer things and do them often enough that you get good at them...rather than doing a lot of things once in a row

- **Exactly Where are they doing that:**

       **Paid Advertising:** Text ads in google search results? Banners? where? which Adnetworks? Are they paying affiliates? How much? In which affiliate networks? Paid post? where? You get the idea. 

      
  **SEO:** Where the backlinks are coming from? Which keywords bring the traffic?

 **Social Media:** Which Social Network works better for them? Facebook? Twitter? Youtube? Pinterest? Niche forums? 
      
      
 **Content Marketing**: They have a blog? Are they guest blogging? Where? Are they doing videos?  

So, how you get this info? 

Sign up here for my email list... Come on! You can't take a joke  eh? **Here is how:**

**Who your main competitors are:** 

Search in google for your main keywords. In this example we can search for ""Funny T Shirts"", ""Original T Shirts"", ""Geek T Shirts"". You can use the [Adwords Keyword Tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool) to find which keywords are more relevant for your product. 

If you do 3 searches, you will get aprox. 60 results (10 organic and 11 paid for every search)

Put in a spreadsheet every url. Paid and Organic. (Tip: Do not click the ads, you will cost money to this guys and is better to generate good karma. Just copy and paste the urls.)

If you see a lot of paid ads is a good signal, it validates the market. If people pay for ads that means the are getting money back.

Eliminate the duplicates. 

**Now order them by traffic volume.** I used to manually go to Quantcast, Compete and Alexa, to get an approximate idea. 10 days ago I discover a little tool and I falled in love:

[Follow.net](http://follow.net/) Not only gives you the traffic data, but also data on ""what"" and ""where"" (more on that in a moment) 

You use that, or go the manual way. 

If you installed this app, visit every one of the websites of your list and get data from the "" traffic"" tab. Focus only on the traffic data now. You want to boil down you list before doing the rest.

**The good thing is that here you start to answer questions about your market too: because you start to see nice demographic data for every site (age, sex, etc).** 

Put the data on the spreadsheet and order them by traffic volume. 

Now you can work with your main ones (depends on the market, but 5 to 10 is a good rule of thumb). 

**Now, to answer the ""what are they doing and where"" questions**, before discovering [Follow.net](http://follow.net/) I used to work with this tools: [KeywordSpy](http://www.keywordspy.com/), [SpyFu](http://www.spyfu.com/), [MixRank](http://mixrank.com/), [OpenSiteExplorer](http://www.opensiteexplorer.org), and search in every affiliate network manually. You can use Follow or those (I think you have free trials on all of them).  
 
This will give you data on Paid Advertising (Search, Display and affiliates), Top referrers, and SEO. 

**You still need data on social media.** This is easy. Every site in you list have buttons that show in which Social Networks they are present. Visit them and note down how many fans, followers or subscribers they have. 

While you're looking at the facebook page of one competitor click in the tab displaying the number of fans. **More demographic data!** This will give you age groups and geographical influence. 

You want to study what are they publishing, and what work best for them (Pictures, Links, Videos, etc.) use [FanPageKarma.com](http://www.fanpagekarma.com).


**And last, you want to know where they are been mentioned.** AKA, the influencers of the market. 

Search in google for ""mycompetitorname"" and ""mycompetitorname.com"" and you get a nice list of media oulets, blogs and forums who have mention them. 

The assumption is that if somebody mentions them is because they think that kind of content is valuable for their readership. **So they have an inclination to mention you too.** 


**TLDR;** 

**Google your main keywords and list every url in the results, install the extension [Follow](http://follow.net/) and visit each one of those urls. Sort by traffic. Grab the main ones and check where they are getting the traffic from (SEO, SEM, Affiliates, Social Media, etc.), use [Fanpagekarma](http://www.fanpagekarma.com/) for more social media info, and do searchs for your competitors name to see wich blogs/media outlets mention them.** 

I hope this was useful. It took longer that I thought. I left out some things because I wanted to keep it short (and failed miserably). English is not my first language so apologies for any mistake.

The school of hard knocks is fine and dandy, but learning about the industry firsthand from someone who already accomplished what you're setting out to do is going to save you headaches.

I've had a lot of people give me the excuse that they can't find someone or that they don't know who to ask. My first summer from college, I opened up the phone book and started calling every company listed *(EDIT: every company in the general category of what I was interested in, not the whole phone book)*, starting at the A's. By the B's, I had my paid mentorship. From that mentorship, the things I learned and the people I met moved me into a career I didn't have a clue I would have back then.

Plus, if you're planning on picking up and leaving your business 3 months into operation, your chances of earning money are much greater if you got a part-time job somewhere else.

Hello /r/Entrepreneur,

I've really enjoyed this community since finding it a couple months ago.  I just completed the sale of my business last week, and am now in search of my next opportunity.  Figured I'd offer some of this ""free time"" doing an AMAA if anyone's interested.

Since leaving school 6 years ago, I've started numerous companies ranging from software, to selling marketing services, to wholesaling and distributing various products.

At times I've marketed through knocking on doors, cold calling, email, SEO, PPC, Affiliate programs, and mail.

I've gone into boardrooms face to face with executives at Fortune 500 companies.  I've also started online companies, selling hundreds of thousands without ever meeting a customer or supplier.

I've created brands, found manufacturers, set up distribution channels, and negotiated partnerships with major companies.

I've had 80 hour work weeks, and I've also automated companies to the point that there's almost nothing for me to do.

I've had some successes such as growing a company from zero to $1 million in sales within 11 months.  I've grown 3 other companies into the 6 figure sales range.  I've sold two companies.  

I've also failed numerous times.  In the beginning, I almost went bankrupt before I started having any real success.  I've battled serious self doubt, hopelessness, and almost quit (ie got a job) on a couple occasions.

Due to some NDA's and general respect for those that are now running my companies, I can't share specific websites and company names, but I'm happy to answer any other questions.

Last summer, I posted here asking “how can I take my invention idea from concept to reality?” I was met with an overwhelming amount of enthusiasm and support. My initial post caught the eye of another redditor, who messaged me to tell me that he was a professional product developer and would love to help. I was skeptical at first asking myself “What’s in it for him? Maybe he just wants to steal my idea?” He explained that he simply loved invention/engineering and also wanted to build his resume in order to one day start his own product development firm. My faith in humanity restored and my ego humbled by this man’s selfless passion, development of Wheel Shields began.

Prototyping Wheel Shields was a long and arduous process. We ran into a TON of engineering challenges, none of which were easy to solve by email (the primary way I communicated with my engineer since we live hundreds of miles apart). During this time, my business needs evolved and I found myself often coming back to this subreddit for advice. 

When I needed general business advice very early on, I found a consultant on here who helped me learn some very fundamental elements of entrepreneurship.

When I needed a logo done, I connected with a free-lance digital artist on a different subreddit.

When I needed shirts done, I posted here and got a PM from a guy who runs a shirt company who gave me a great deal.

When I needed business cards, I posted here and was flooded with discount codes and coupons.

Reddit has connected me with my engineer, business consultant, digital artist, and shirt/business card manufacturers. I’m still floored by the amount of help I received from this community and want to thank all of you for treating my dreams as if they were your own. Wheel Shields wouldn’t even be close to where they are today without all the help I’ve received.

We’ve finalized the product, established a massive fan base on Facebook (70,000+ likes) and have endorsements from two Guinness World Record-holding longboarders. Now that we are ready to launch and have manufacturing lined up, we’ve launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the mold need for mass production. I’m not asking you to pledge/donate, I just want to show you what is achievable with a year of work with the backing of this subreddit:

Thanks again for all your support and never stop believing in your dreams! I'm happy to answer any questions, but may be slow replying as I try to get the Kickstarter into as many blogs as possible. 

edit: Hey guys thanks for all the awesome questions and input! I'm super swamped right now trying to get Wheel Shields into online blogs/publications, but I'll try to reply to ya'll later tonight. Please PM me if you know of any writers you think might be interested in Wheel Shields/Kickstarter!

I bootstrapped the crap out of the site, so it doesn't look amazing, but I'm starting to get sales. Before I launched the website, it used to be a newsletter site for people to get notified of new software releases. I had about 300 people on the subscriber list but I didn't make any money out of it and people weren't really that interested. Since re-launching it as this type of site, its now at 530 subscribers and still growing.

In week 1 I had 5 sales, week 2 I had 22 sales, and now in week 3 I have 42 sales. I like how well sales are growing, but I'm only taking a 10% cut from each sale (from the net amount after processing fees etc.). 

I'm pretty new to all of this, so where exactly should I go from here? I was advised to spend money on advertising and get my subscriber list as large as possible so as to keep increasing sales? Is this a good idea to be spending money on advertising so soon?

**Validate Your Skill Level**

Are you currently a web programmer? If no, please do not attempt to become one to code your own dynamic website as security is a huge issue and it will take you years to catch up. It is not a reasonable effort to put forth if you want to keep your sanity, not burn your spare time, etc. Not saying you can't learn it, just saying it takes a lot of work and time that most entrepreneurs don't have to use and in some cases waste.

Focus on content instead of all the code. You will get a better product in the end.

You can learn how to do html and css within a few months but using a CMS system is much cleaner and easier and if you need something dynamic, you will probably need a developer. 

You generally need to know at least php and mysql for dynamic websites unless you want to get into the confusing worlds of joomla and drupal. I hear decent things about Ruby on Rails though on par with php and mysql learning curve I think.

**Want to Learn Web Programming Anyway?**

Try [CodeCademy](http://www.codecademy.com) for interactive programming learning.

**No Coding Skills Start Here**

Get / Use the following:

* **Hosting:** [Bluehost.com](https://www.bluehost.com/)
* **Domain name:** Buy through Bluehost and get a privacy option on it
* **Web Platform to one click install:** WordPress a CMS platform
* **Find an appropriate responsive wordpress theme here:** [Themeforest.net](http://themeforest.net/)
* **Install and configure these free plugins in order:** [Better WP Security](http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/), [BackWPup](http://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup/), [Akismet](http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/), [Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/), [Broken Link Checker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/), [Growmap Anti Spambot Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/growmap-anti-spambot-plugin/), [Date/Time Now Button](http://wordpress.org/plugins/datetime-now-button/), and [Advanced Responsive Video Embedder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/)
* **Buy other plugins you need here:** [CodeCanyon.net](http://codecanyon.net/)
* **Need an affiliate manager?:** Use [Linksert.net](https://www.linksert.net/) and it's free [WordPress plugin](https://www.linksert.net/plugin).

**Need Something More Dynamic?**

You have a few options. This list goes from least expensive to most expensive. Just know that most things you want to do already have a plugin or theme designed for them for WordPress. There are however a lot of exceptions to that guideline and that is why you look at the following options.

* Least Expensive end
* Hire someone to develop a WordPress plugin to do that dynamic stuff (cheaper than second option)
* Hire someone to build you a custom WordPress theme that has the functionality you need. 
* Hire someone to develop the site from the ground up. 
* Most expensive end

The reason why WordPress is mentioned a lot is because it is a CMS aka Content Management System which allows you to manage a ton of the pages and posts and various other aspects of the website. If a developer really needs to, they can modify the core parts of WordPress. Rarely will you need someone to build you a brand new website and honestly you really do want a CMS or you are going to have a hard time.

Some developers can be found here: [Elance](https://www.elance.com/) (freelancers), [Matchist](http://matchist.com/) (freelancers), and [Glowtouch](http://www.glowtouch.com/) (dev company vetted by Bluehost)

**Things to remember with website development**

* Try to use a responsive website themes and plugins so that it can fit any screen size including tablets and phones.
* Get familiar with what they call ""sticky footer"" so that your footers don't end up halfway up the screen on low content pages. [Example and info.](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/using-sticky-footer-code.html)
* Get familiar with the concept of having a fixed header as it will promote a lot of use of your website. [Example and info.](http://lifeinthegrid.com/simple-css-fixed-header/)
* Design is important. You have ~2.6 seconds to capture their attention before they bounce. Read this book to learn about it: ""[Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)""

1359983427.0,104,self.Entrepreneur,17v514,What many of you have wrong about outsourcing,itchyouch,145,41,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17v514/what_many_of_you_have_wrong_about_outsourcing/,"Off and on, I see random success/failure stories about outsourcing.  Finally reading about things like [$800 on 99 designs...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17t37i/ive_just_spent_800_on_99designs_and_designcrowd/) have shown a thorough misunderstanding by the OP and many of the commenters about the point of outsourcing.

**To be as clear as possible:**

**Outsourcing is currency arbitrage &amp; currency arbitrage only.**

This has many ramifications for what out sourcing is NOT and what is does NOT accomplish.

* **Outsourcing does not decrease the amount of work that needs to be done.**  A worker in India, South America or even on Mars must do the same amount of work (billable hours @ hourly rate) to accomplish the same goal. The point being made here is that depending on what one is looking for, it should take roughly a similar amount of billable hours to accomplish.  If you're looking for a job that takes 10 hours in the U.S., then with similar tools, it should also take 10 hours in Chile.  
   * If the market rate for designers of roughly equal quality is $120/hr in the US and $20/hour elsewhere, then expect that a 100 hour job will cost you $12k in the US and still cost $2k elsewhere.  Trying to find $12k worth of work for $100 only works if the currency arbitration works out to that rate.  As most have experienced, when attempting to purchase a $12k job for $100, either the equivalent amount of work has not been done (quality suffers), or you're getting work with shortcuts that were made that may or may not be acceptable to you (forgery, copy/paste).
* **Design competitions are not outsourcing.**  Competitions are competitions.  Design competitions abroad with USD as the prize is just putting out a sufficiently large enough carrot to attract participants.  If Martians outsourced work to the earth and put out a $5k prize for a winning design for their needs, do you think any respected designer with an established business would participate?  Nope, the amateurs (diamonds in the rough) and scammy people out to make a quick buck would participate (e.g. logos that are just a font).

* **Outsourcing does not replace proper &amp; good process.**  This is perhaps the most important for any build project.  Things like work quotes, time estimates, preliminary sketches, sign offs, project management don't go away with outsourcing.  The way you work with someone abroad is EXACTLY the same as how you should be working with someone local.  The only difference is that you're using different methods of collaboration (in-person vs remote) to follow those practices.

* **All quality work HAS value.** As the saying goes, good help is hard to find.  An excellent worker will most-of-the-time/always demand their countries respective top compensation.  Since outsourcing is currency arbitrage, top work will still cost you top dollar minus the effective rates after currency exchange.

* **Outsourcing is not cheap labor.**  A similar point to the prior point.  Paradoxically, the more attractive a destination is for outsourcing, the more value their country gains and starts to effectively eliminate the currency arbitrage opportunity.

* **Outsourcing does not necessarily come with the same value added customer services as local firms.**  This is a similar point to following good process.  Things like being in the same time zone, being able to hash out an idea on a napkin over lunch, vetting out honesty/portfolio (via body language), cultural similarity &amp; tastes, cultural compatibility,  proper/accepted U.S. English grammar and many others are value add-ons that we almost never think about.  Currency arbitrage is purely currency arbitrage and the pros/cons of the value-added services need to be weighed.  This is the wisdom behind having a good project manager, to let someone else alleviate the communication overhead and be a task master to achieve the desired results.

* **Outsourcing only for currency arbitration is a short-sighted recipe for failure** The reality is that most people are looking for lower-cost employees that work remotely or they are looking for a freelance/consulting firm to provide deliverables at a lower cost.  It always makes sense to also consider outsourcing projects locally, getting multiple quotes, reviewing the prior work/portfolio of jobs done before hand, etc.  This is also redundant advice on following good process.

So in summary, if I haven't drilled it into your heads enough.  Outsourcing is not a magic 5-dollar bullet.  It's only function is currency arbitrage.  The world economy is uncertain and as more time passes by, the opportunities for currency arbitrage get slimmer and slimmer. (Think, India's best programmers now command pretty close to U.S counterparts anyway)  As far as outsourcing goes, Google recognizes the value-adds that are given up to take advantage of the arbitrage.  I remember reading about how they outsource to India for programmers, but since Goog realizes that programming is an art, they built out their own facilities to train programmers to be the best at a lower price point.

Anyway, I'm rambling on.  Happy outsourcing.

***EDIT***
Some have pointed out some discrepancies of which I whole heartedly agree with.

* The better terminology should be *salary arbitrage* not currency arbitrage.

http://www.designcrowd.com/vote/logo-design-for-flightfishingcom

Site 2: Travel videos and audio content focusing on education (better tourist)
http://99designs.com/logo-design/vote-onqrmb

So, like many, I was looking for some logo and branding help.  I turned to reddit and found out about crowd sourcing design.  People basically seemed to have two opinions about it.  Some reported success, lots of graphic designers hated it (which it's basically in their best interest to do having worked with it).

What I didn't find was anyone who said that using it was a mistake.  Hopefully the next person who looks will find this to give them more context.

My budget for a design was about $300 each.  Not too cheap (IMO), not top-of-the-line.  I wrote a creative brief and sent it out. Fast forward five days later and I had about 20 designs for each and almost all of them were really bad.  Many of them used clip-art, and most of them were completely unusable (this was more true from designcrowd than 99designs).   A percentage were from designers who had submitted hundreds of designs and who had never won a single award.

""Okay,"" I thought, ""there are good designers here, they just aren't working for me"".  

DesignCrowd and 99 designs both suggested guaranteeing my prize, advertising my post, and increasing my amount  

So I increased my award amount to $400 and added three participation awards of $20 each in DesignCrowd and did something similar for 99 designs.  Add that to the fees and we're at around $800 for both.  

We all know that I could have hired a decent graphic designer for this amount of money;  I could have posted it here on reddit and had some designs by the end of the day.  But I was a victim of sunk cost and I didn't want to give up on the hours I spent giving feedback and eliminating designs.  

Now, about two days later, I have the designs you see above.  Some of them are better than others (please take some time to rate them if you're able) but I'm not committed to any of the designers at this point so I don't get any of their full attention.  They would be crazy to spend much time on revision there's a good chance I won't choose their design.

As I finish the process, I've come to these conclusions:
-More choice don't equate to better choices
-Good designers generally only work for good money, no matter where they are located. 
-99designs and designcrowd require very active participation, mostly just to filter out the crap but also to provide feedback.
-You will almost certainly spend more than you expect

TL;DR
I wasted a ton of time and probably didn't save any money.  I got some decent designs but may have done better with a talented freelancer from Craigslist or Reddit.  When my budget was low, the work was bad.

**TL:DR I got the idea to import hair extensions from Asia via this subreddit in August, started with $300 now ordering about $1,000 a week. Profit margins varying from 20% to 75%.** 

**BACK STORY**
Back in August 2011 when I was still unemployed and down to my last $300 I see a post on here asking about importing products someone post an article about an Australian Kid who imported MP3 players from China and over time made $100,000+. [LINK TO THE REDDIT POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/is5ev/how_could_one_enter_the_business_of_importsexports/c267osz) I should give revolved some reddit gold or something.

I stayed up all night thinking what could I import and sell. I came to the idea of importing hair extensions which in my city has hundreds of retails stores near salons but the retail stores never work B2B with the salons. I ordered a sample and received my first order paid in advance and made a nice $30 profit.

**CURRENTLY**

* I work 8 to 5, M - F in a job near my home and customers. Lunch break is sales time!
* Ordering about $2000 at a time.
* I am working directly with 3 salons.
* Turning over my inventory about every 2 weeks.
* I secured a line of credit with my banks for $600 I pay off the card in full about twice a month.
* Moved all my personal money, bills, and direct deposit to my credit union.
* Still live at home with parents so no Life overhead to eat at profits.
* Outside a few hundred from my initial orders all the money being used is the profits.
* I got charged my first customs bill because my last order $3200 had to come in a box the looked like it went through middle earth to get here.

On a typical sale I am making $40 - $95 profit, the salons then make profit of $25 - $100 selling to their customer. I give to salons on account (my only risk) so I usually give them 8 pieces of hair (it takes 2 pieces to do a client). Which can be $500 - $800 of outstanding inventory. I only here from them Thursday, Friday, and Saturday when clients get their hair styled for the weekend. I am paid as soon as they sell product I get the call to pick up my money. This works now but I would like to grow this hustle into a business.

My #1 HIGH VOLUME customer wants me only to sell to her salon, my extensions is a cash cow for them. Actually that salon was the third one I approached but I have a since of loyalty to the smaller salon that allowed me to walk in and helped educate me on what I had. They aren't ordering $500 - $1000 a week like the large one but do indeed order.

**Operating Equipment**

*  My Android cell phone with a Google Voice # I only give to clients and put on my business card.
*  My 2009 MacBook Pro
*  My 1993 Camry

**Closing**
I am nothing more than a middle man and I humble in the fact that if any of my salons decided to actually do their own research they could import on their own. I am not allowing myself to get *comfortable* with my new stream of entrepreneurial income. Hopefully I can grind this into a business or make enough to start a new business. I do want to fly to Asia to meet my supplier in person and for the experience as I never been on a plane or outside my Tri-state area.",,False,self,t5_2qldo,False,,,True,t3_ncend,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ncend/i_started_a_business_from_a_reddit_post_help_me/,

[Selling Used or Unwanted Books on Amazon for 20-50 bucks a week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAgt5exBLyc)

I have been selling books on Amazon for about 2 years now.  I usually get the books for super cheap (thousands of books for 50-100 bucks) and I spend probably an hour of my free time every week once the books are listed, making anywhere from 20-50 bucks a week. Which could be increased if it was something i actually wanted to pursue.  I personally know a guy who employes 5 people and makes 100k a year for himself doing this.

*I had a lot of people ask me where to buy shipping envelopes, So i posted a link in the video description where you can get those in bulk. 

*Also people want to know where to get books.  I usually just post in my local classifieds that i am interested in picking up large quantity of books for free.  And i usually get a few calls a month from people who are just clearing out their library. And all i have to do is go pick it up.  Thats the best way.  The last person who called me wanted 100 bucks, but it was worth it to pay for a couple thousand books. 

[Using my Amazon Affiliate Account to monetize a website or YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q8lKs84gQQ)

I use Amazon hyper links in the description of the videos on my YouTube channel [JerryRigEverything](http://www.youtube.com/user/JerryRigEverything/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0) to  generate a passive income.  That channel deals mostly with auto repair and fixing stuff, so I place links relating to the part I am replacing in the video description and I get a percentage of whatever sells on amazon.
You can use these links to make money on Pintrest or your own websites as well.

[Aeration helped me have $10,000 in the bank by the time I was 19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRb_EnPPXm0)

I'm going to start a business without any of my own money, or my own ideas.  Those of you who are interested can follow the twitter account I've made for it [@nomoneynoideas](https://twitter.com/nomoneynoideas) and I'll post occasional updates here.  I'm going to try to post as much info as I can about what I'm doing so that anyone can follow along and see what goes on behind the scenes of a fledgeling company.

I'll be making a few safe assumptions, which should allow anyone to repeat what I'm doing.

* You have internet access, a computer, and a phone.
* You have little technical expertise in any given field
* You have no money
* You have no usable idea

What do I need from everyone else?  I need you to keep me motivated!  I need people watching and asking questions, I need people to network with in case I need some specific talents, and I need people to give me instructions on how to do business better!

Asking why?

I've lurked here, occasionally posting, for a long while now.  I've seen many a post asking ""What's a good business to start with no startup funds?""  and  ""What's the best business to start for me?"".  While people try to answer, no one really shows how it all comes together - I want to fix that.  It is my sincere hope that this goes well enough to be linked often - maybe even slapped on the sidebar for those wanting an in depth look into the nitty gritty.

Most recently, I have graduated from college - freeing up tons of time to do whatever I want.  During college I worked at a small company where the founder did exactly this, so I do have a slightly unfair advantage in having seen his methods - but all will be revealed!",,False,self,t5_2qldo,False,,,True,t3_1cbdqc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1cbdqc/how_to_start_a_business_with_no_money_and_no_idea/,

1349897541.0,84,self.Entrepreneur,119ned,Why do so many employers shit on employees?,yourjoboffersucks,97,13,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/119ned/why_do_so_many_employers_shit_on_employees/,"I've been a consultant for a little over a year.  

When I left my last job, union positions and other non-management staff took a collective 8% pay cut.  The unions also agreed to basically get no increases for 4 years.  Shortly afterword’s management salaries increases by 25% (low and middle managers got 5 to 8% increase and top managers got 25%+). 

I applied for a management position.  That job went to my boss’s friend.  A week later I told my manager that I was resigning; but that I'd stay for $100,000.  They were pissed that I was leaving and felt betrayed.  But they also said it was too much money to pay me to stay (I made $85k when I left).

Since that time I've billed them, as a consultant, for 160 hours of work at the rate of $250/hour.  And, the year is not over.  They have hired two people to replace me, both making mid-70’s.  Neither of the two people can do the actual job that I did, and so we are working on another contract for me to do more work. 
  
I’ve consulted for about 15 other clients and my finding is this:  Companies don’t want to hire and pay people.  The good people they do have tend to get burned out after a year or two because they’re overworking.  They get dumped on.  

There is an attitude at the top about the employees they have.   Employees are essentially disposable and not valued assets.  The top also believes their success is a direct credit to how deserving and wonderful they are.   Of course they are wrong.  In fact, often times the top is so disconnected from what really is happening in their organization that they add obstacles to their own success.  

But what amazes me is how they are willing to pay me $250/hour to do a job as a consultant instead of hiring me as a fulltime employee for $50/hour.  It’s the same job.  It’s a job that never ends.  It’s a job where they’ll still need more of me.  They could get me or someone like me for 1/5 the price.  

Why?

I think it’s because they are lazy and have no fucking clue.  They just make the shit up as they go.  

Several times I’ve said, “Look, see Joe/Sally over there?  That’s a critical person.  If they leave your f’d.  They are overworked and underpaid.  If you dump this project on them without support they’ll leave.”  Guess what they do?  They dump.  I warned them and because I warned them they’re mad at me now.  But I don’t give a fuck because they’ll pay me $250/hour to do the job Joe/Sally was doing for $40/hour.  This happens over and over again.

If you own a company, my advice to you is this:  Find your critical people and treat them well.  Otherwise you’ll end up paying for it.

1373491276.0,79,self.Entrepreneur,1i1a8y,"Sharing my small victory - It's been one year since I pursued the goal of financial freedom and today I made my first $1,000 in real sales",Thehealthygamer,96,17,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1a8y/sharing_my_small_victory_its_been_one_year_since/,"I graduated from college in May of 2012 and had that ""oh shit"" moment. My degree is in accounting. I HATED accounting work. Now I faced the prospect of a bleak future of loathing work and slaving away at the 9-5 until I could finally retire, fat, unhappy, and likely an alcoholic(fact 7.878/10 accountants are alcoholics).

Then I discovered an internet marketing thread on a bodybuilding forum I frequented. I dove in. Tried it all. First I was going to design free websites for journalism students and get paid by bluehost commissions. Then I was going to start a SEO business. Then I was going to rank up for dentist and doctor keywords and sell ad space.

Can you see where I went wrong? I was focusing on the MONEY and not on the VALUE generation.

The idea that finally worked for me was when I sat down and thought ""what is unique about myself that is rare and valuable?"" And the answer: I'm a 200lb Asian bodybuilder who was a World of Warcraft addict for 5 years. There's a real need for health, fitness, and self-esteem for hardcore gamers. Then I started creating content to fill that niche and created http://www.thehealthygamer.com

It's now been over a year. I have 11,644 subscribers on YouTube(http://www.youtube.com/user/HappyJacksChannel) and the website does well. I'm still slogging through it, learning, and improving every day. But I am convinced that it was my change in philosophy of ""how do I make money"" to ""how can I best provide value to people"" that then lead to my content being successful.

I released a paid member's section on June 13th and released T-Shirts two days ago. Between those two products I've managed to make over $1,000 in sales and I consider this my first ""real"" money(because anyone can throw ads up on a video - to get people to open their wallets for you demonstrates a much higher level of trust).

And really my take-away from this whole last year is to just keep going. Focus on making small incremental improvements every day. Don't expect perfection and you won't be disappointed. Failures are nothing but signs that you need to make course corrections. I had high hopes of capping out my paid member's section in a week. Well that hasn't happened at all. So I see I have two choices - give up, OR figure out how I can provide more value for the membership and how to better communicate that value to my audience. And in that process I develop the valuable skillset of sales which will benefit me for the rest of my life.

So don't look at your venture as something that will make or break you. Look at your venture for all of the skills you're gaining - becoming a better writer, salesman, leader, thinker. Becoming more confident in yourself, becoming a better risk taker, becoming better at managing stress. Monetary success from your venture is a bonus.

We're a very successful school, and it pays me pretty well, but for the work I'm doing I'd like more. I started full time last July with one of my friends (who had gone to 35 hours a week 11 months earlier), who ended up making 40k his first year, which I thought would be a GREAT deal for me because. He was just a full time instructor, where I would be a full time instructor and office manager. He and another employee (who was part time) did a few stupid things and got fired so I absorbed their whole positions, making me worth 2 full time instructors and 1.5 office managers, roughly. Great, right? 

Not so. My hours jumped from that initial 30-35 to 50-55 a week (with, says my boss, ""weeks coming where you'll be working 9AM-9PM with an hour for lunch, Monday through Saturday"") , doing more than any single person has done at one time for the business, at awful hours for having a social life, and I'm STILL not making as much as my friend who worked half as much as me and was stoned out of his mind for 75% of it. I'll be pushing 27k this year which I, with one year of college under my belt, am definitely not complaining about, but because of feeling inadequate and kind of taken advantage of at my work place, I've been losing wind for a few months. 

Fast forward to yesterday, where my boss (the owner) says to one of his friends after discussing local young entrepreneurs, ""anyone who works for somebody else is a complete sucker"".

 That drained my battery almost immediately. For the 55 hours of weekly work I've been doing, sure I might not make 27k the first year, but I feel like with my skill set I could do well in the online information business. I think I'm gonna start making ebooks and videos about something I know about and charge like $5 or $10 a copy and market them on relevant interest websites, and see how that goes.

It is a business. You should always find out if you can monetize. You don't have to right from the beginning but you should have a really good plan of how it will happen. Being aquired is NOT a monetization plan. 

Twitter wasn't monetized for a long time but you can see how easy it was to do. Facebook took a while to get ads but they do have them now. 

You must have a way to monetize or you are esentially running a charity.

If you are a blogger you probably have in mind some ways you want to make money or you have ways you are making money. If you don't have the plan, then you are just running a hobby or charity.

Figure out how to charge people.

Do you have this problem? Let's solve it right now. Put your situation down and why you don't have an idea for monetizing your product or service and we can all pick at it and figure out some ideas.

The course is at https://www.udemy.com/develop-iphone-and-ipad-apps-with-no-programming-experience/ and use the coupon code: learnforfree (which will apply a 100% off and make it free)

Here is more detail about it:

The course covers how to develop an iOS app through outsourcing. It's geared towards beginners who have no idea where to begin when it comes to developing an app and hiring someone overseas to do it. I was once there and have learned a lot in two years. I've developed four apps and have hired teams all overseas. The course will take beginners from how to get an idea, validate it, prepare your idea, and all the steps when it comes to hiring a team to work on it. It also covers what you'll need to prepare to upload it to the App store. Will admit it's light on the marketing cause it's not my strong point. But it covers everything before. 

I've developed four apps like I said and never had any one run off with my money, or delivered what I didn't ask for. So just sharing my experience to help others. 

Hope it can help you get that idea you've had in your mind become a reality, but you don't know how to code at all. It could start a new business for you, or earn you some money on the side. Again the code is ""learnforfree"".

Thanks and I hope you guys find this useful. Any thoughts or feedback is welcome!

Edit: Wow over 400+ people have joined cause of this thread! Hope many of you will have an app soon. That coupon has expired so I created a new one that'll get you access to the course for only $49. Just use the coupon REDDIT.

What I don't understand is all the pessimism and the put-downs of others ideas.

As entrepreneurs it's almost our job to go against the odds and prevail.. isn't that the one thing we all have in common?  Sure we calculate our risks but when all is said and done we're still all risking something.  Whether buying a bar, starting a furniture company, developing an app or starting a forum, every single one of us is taking a risk.

So how come I'll (very) often see someone visiting r/entrepreneur asking for advice on how to get their idea off the ground only to be bombarded by comments like ""that will never work"" or "" it seems like you know nothing about your idea, why bother pursue it?"".

It's one thing to shoot an idea down when someone asks what we think of it, but it's a whole other thing when they need advice on where to go to find resources.. and we just tell them their idea is stupid when we have no idea how well they could deliver.

I don't know, maybe I'm just to positive.



**UPDATE:** I'm lovin' the feedback guys (even you bastards calling me a cheerleader hahaha) and many of you have made phenomenal points.  

I want to say that I may have come off as unclear -  I'm not advocating motivational speaking or making a person feel like a god for their idea..  As a matter of fact constructive criticism is ideal and one of the primary reasons why someone looking to start a business should come here.  But.  Even though constructive criticism is great, simply being a jerk-off for the sake of being a jerk-off is not.  We should all strive to help one another the best we can.  If someone doesn't want to talk about their idea, we should tell them were not really going to be able to help but point them in some sort of direction to educate themselves.

I do however agree with a handful of you that said if they can't take the criticism on here, then they wont be able to make it in the real world.

1363796154.0,75,self.Entrepreneur,1ao4du,I made an iPhone app that's I'm somewhat proud of.  It's called Fridge Pal and is a shopping list / home inventory / recipe tool.  Looking for advice on how to promote it and build a larger customer base.  Sales data and history inside for those making apps and who are interested.,nazbot,108,33,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ao4du/i_made_an_iphone_app_thats_im_somewhat_proud_of/,"Hey all,

Posted this on /r/cooking and someone messaged me to say I should post the app here.

Basically I made an iPhone app in my spare time.  The impetus for making the app was that I had some code to scan barcodes and wanted to find an interesting use for it.  I often had the problem that I'd put food in my fridge and sometimes forget to use it before it went bad or just forget how old it was (sauces and long term items like that).

I figured I could make an app that would let you scan barcodes when you put stuff in the fridge and then have it remind you to use items when they might be going bad.

When I got that working I realized it would be great to also add in a shopping list component.  As well, I had looked at other shopping list apps in the app store and was not really very impressed with what I saw.  I figured I could do better.

In addition, since I had a ton of items that were in my fridge it seemed to make sense to be able to search for recipes using combinations of those items.  Tap a few groceries and then search for recipes that use those combinations - good for when you have an expiring item and aren't quiet sure what to do with it.

I went with a paid upgrade approach to monetization - I made the app free to download and then put in an in app purchase of $2.99 to unlock features.

I average bout 70-100 downloads a day and from that get around 3-4 paid upgrades.  In total I've made about $3000 from about 6 month's of sales.  I split the profits with the designer (another redditor).  I didn't do any advertising or send the app in to review sites to promote it.  It was not really at the point where I could feel comfortable with it until very recently.  I think I have a conversion rate of about 5% which seems decent from what I've heard.

I upgraded the app yesterday and got about 3,500 people who upgraded so that seems to be my user base.  Pretty damn small at the moment. :)  That's from about 21,000 people who have downloaded the app over the course of time.

It sits about 800 in the US productivity app store and just recently I changed it to Food and Drink where it debuted at around 300 in the US app store.

One comment on this approach that other app developers may find interesting - I'm not sure if doing the in app purchase  is the best way to drive sales.  Free apps need a LO of downloads in order to rise in the ranks and if you're making an app that's limited I'm not sure it provides enough value to become a hit.  If I had made a purely paid option (with the lite version opening the link to the paid version) I wonder if I would have had much better visibility in the app store itself.

I'm asking you guys if you could review the app and let me know whether there's anything in it that you think is poorly made.  Likewise, I'd really like to get advice on what I can do to help promote the app and try to get it to become more visible in the app store.  The current model is that the app is free to use but there is a 10 item limit in the shopping list and 10 item limit in the home inventory.  My thought was to let people use all the features of the app and see if they liked it and then upgrade if it seemed good.  I'm contemplating going to a more segmented approach where you can use the app fully but limit features - so only let users create 2 shopping lists and only 1 storage area.  Or alternatively only let users create multiple shopping lists if they upgrade. The thought is that maybe if the app is actually useful as a free download people will use it long enough that they eventually want to unlock the full features of the app.  On the other hand I wanted users to be able to use the app fully and see all the features which would hopefully entice them to upgrade.

Star Ratings and reviews all seem pretty good - mostly 4 and 5 star reviews with people saying that it's well designed and easy to use.  No major bugs or crashes.

Just as some feature bullet points which separate this from other shopping list apps:

- Dropbox support so the app can add text files of your shopping list / home inventory / recipe lists
- Syncing and push notifications when you have multiple devices or people in your home using the app
- Notifications to remind you to use food when it goes bad without needing to open the app
- Shopping Lists are GPS aware so when you leave a store without buying everything it will remind you
- Some fairly nice art and design compared to other shopping list apps

As well, in terms of /r/Entrepreneur I have had thoughts of possibly taking this to an incubator or shopping it around.  I sort of see some potential to monetize this by partnering with a coupon site or a grocery store.  Since users are adding their home inventory there seems like some interesting possibilities to get customer data and usage patterns which might allow for some interesting possibilities - e.g. if your ketchup is about to go bad it might be reasonable to target a coupon for ketchup at that user with a push notification.  Likewise shopping habits and things like that could be interesting data to use.  I'm strongly against exploiting user data and privacy etc but if there's a way to make that kind of data useful to users then I think there are some interesting possibilities.  I wouldn't even know where to begin looking into that possibility, though, and would love feedback in that regard.

I would say the hardest part was finding a good supplier that didn't charge outrageous dropship fees.  There were some suppliers charging $10 per order to dropship.

The next phase was the layout and design.  While I do have some experience with html and photoshop, shopify made it really easy.  I've read around here that some people say it's pretty expensive, but if I had to hire a programmer to build a site from the ground up, it would have been a lot more money.

It's not like I'm confusing it with being tough, no, it's simply being a jerk. For instance Jobs would sometimes throw pages of code in the faces of his engineers (without looking at them) and say ""it's the stupidest shit ever"", even during interviews would ask the candidates if they're virgins, even ignored his daughter for a year. Gates was the same, often insulting people and calling them stupid, even tried diluting Paul Allen's shares when he was suffering from cancer and going through radiation.
  
 It's not just techies either...for example David Geffen would manipulate and use underhanded tactics to screw people over.

I already own a business that is not related to e-commerce at all (service), but I was always curious about it. I really wanted to start something.

After reading the article about importing from China, I would like to share my experience.

Basically I wanted to import Bows to sell. I found a supplier, talk to him for a week, I tried to get as much information and I then bought 2 bows  (different models) as sample. The total cost was around 100$.  I paid via Escrow, I was charged on my credit card at the moment of the transaction but I had to confirm the reception of the item for the supplier to be able to receive the money.

First bow: 18$

Second bow: 26$

The shipping for each was 23$. 

The package was sent via FedEx with a tracking number and I was not charged custom fees, so that is good. The packaging was ok, not wow but ok.

I was excited and I was really motivated to sell on different site like Ebay in my country. So I took nice picture and I did put the product on theses different site.

I calculated and my profit margin was 40%. But my mistake was to really not test the product extensively. Because when I did, a week after putting the product online, I realize that some part (the arrow support) is completely junk. So I am obviously not going to sell the product and I did contact the supplier about my issue. But I really doubt he is going to do something about it. 

I am learning from my mistakes and I hope you will not do the same mistakes as me.

My advice would be to buy:

1) A product with little moving part as possible

2) Really test the product, again, again and again.

3) Always order sample! 

Thank you for reading

**Apparently yes!!**

**Now that we have an awesome amount of people to form teams lets hear some ideas! Please post any ideas you want a team to tackle and post them as a top level comment to this thread or in the new startup subreddit /r/startupcompetition**

**Keep it going strong!!**

**Also, if you want to get involved earlier register at http://www.restartupcomp.com/**


The idea is this: 

1. We form X teams (maybe 2 to start out), each with maybe 3-5 people of varying skill sets: Graphic design, marketing, sales, etc. Both teams would have similar total skills to make things more interesting.

1. Start a new post asking the community for any and all ideas for an entrepreneurial startup. These ideas would be limited to low-cost startups. i.e. dropshipping via online store, software subscriptions, tech support, whatever as long as it does not need any angels/venture capitals.

1. The top X ideas (respective of the # of teams) are then each given to a team and the clock starts!

1. The first team to earn $1,000 of profit wins!

This is all for fun, and there won't be any prizes (although, a cut of the profit is a nice prize!) but it also can hopefully get some folks around here more excited to see that it can be done. Specifically, those that are on the edge about starting something themselves and hesitant to take the first step. It can show that success can be made with little capital, and the entrepreneurial game is loads of fun!

I joined the Army National Guard out of high school when I was 17, and I don't know what to do with my life.

I've worked a few minimum wage jobs, the longest I've stayed with one was about 8 months. I can't stand going to work to make a small amount of money knowing that all it is going to do is sustain me until the next paycheck.

Every day that I go in for my shift at work, I feel like I am dying, like I am just wasting my life, but I feel stuck because I can't give up my financial security.

Now, I have a few ideas for businesses I would like to start up, but I seem to just lack the motivation to take the first step. I don't know if ""motivation"" really is the right word, but honestly I'm just scared. Entrepreneurship is a new world I've never explored and I don't know where to start, what's the right path.

My question to you, if you would be so kind to take the time to help me out, is have any of you been in a situation similar to mine? What finally got you to take the first step? How did you develop your first plan and finally go through with it? This is all so new to me.

That when it hit me. there's dancing, or drinking, but what if we added gaming to the mix? Gaming, in all forms from board games to consoles, cards, and more. Imagine a place where you could go inside, order a shot and a burger, and sit down to play some smash brothers, or maybe play a game of magic, or even a place to bring your Dungeons and dragons group where you can get drunk in a bar while you get drunk in a bar.

I envision a place, where instead of inviting your buds to your apartment or house for a halo gamenight, you first head down to the bar, and game it up there, get your dinner and a drink, and go head to head with not only your friends, but anyone who thinks they can take you on. 

Don't like to game? No problem, you can still sit at the bar, enjoy some grub and chat with those there. Don't want to drink or eat? Pay a fee and join in on the games. Diners/drinkers get to play free, and anyone in their group as well, even if they don't buy anything.

I want a place that's fun to hang out at, where people can go and play the games we all know and love. Gaming isn't a kid thing anymore, it was maybe twenty years ago when some of us picked up our first controller or card, But it's clear to see that even adults, and especially adults, considering almost every major non Nintendo game in the past few years has been geared towards us. Dave and Busters already does this with arcade games and ticket booths, but what if we removed the pay per play environment and just introduced it to a true bar environment, that won't cost you and arm, a leg, and a 50 bucks per person just to enjoy yourselves?

I think it will work, and from talking with some of the people in my local community here, it's an idea I think will definitely blossom where I live.

What's the best food angle?",redpistachios,85,16,269,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gnz9d/200000_oil_roughnecks_whats_the_best_food_angle/,"I am up in Oil Country (North Dakota) several times per month and believe there is an opportunity to feed the oil workers.


Here are some quick Points:

Dozens of cities with 10's of thousands of full time out of state employees living in man camps making 6 figures per year.

All cities are usually 30 to 60 minute drive from each-other.

Most current restaurants/fast food chains have lines that go around the block.

Employees are almost impossible to come by.

Logistics related to supplies is tough, but I have constant transportation up to this area and can bring (from Utah) supplies when they are in short supply.


Land is tough to get (and very very expensive) but there are buildings for rent and lease usually (but also expensive).




My question is, what would be a good way to tap into this opportunity?  Lunch Truck? Brick and mortar building? What would be something quick and easy vs a long drawn out construction build. 

I would really like to walk in with a ""new food thing""... not another McDonalds, Not another sandwich place.

*Edit- I completely mixed up my vocab when I wrote this. I am not going for craft beer, I am going for home brewers. Sorry guys I'm not sure what I was thinking. I want to market towards the average guy brewing beer in his garage not a company brewing large amounts for retail. Also I will be posting in /r/stagglabels twice weekly, Tuesdays and Thursdays. There might be more posts in between but that is going to be the regular schedule for updates. Thanks for reading!      

I just quit my factory job to start my first business. I decided that the best time to follow my dreams is now. I'm 19 living with my parents for a couple more months before I move out. I am going to be applying for college in the fall of 2013. The thing is, my high school GPA was terrible (though my test score were higher than average). Starting a small business on my own is going to look much better than just working in a factory for a year. But let me be clear, that is only a small part of why I am doing this. I am doing this because I have a passion for small business, because I want to learn, to do, and to create, to follow my passions. I don't know if my ideas are good, and I know they are going to be horribly executed because I just don't know enough yet. But I have to start. So I’m diving in, for better or for worse. 

So about my startup, I wanted something small, something that would have a niche audience. I decided on designing and selling craft beer labels. Craft beer is big here in America, when I starting thinking about this I googled craft beer labels and found a bunch of sites that allowed people to design labels themselves. I think there is a bit of a hole in the market though. I want to offer people premium labels. Something classy, these labels would not be something that you would buy for every batch you brew, these are for special occasions. Your buddy’s birthday, a wedding gift, or just to show off to your friends when you brew that perfect batch. 
 
The site is called stagglabels.com. 

So Reddit, I am very excited about this. You have inspired me. I want this so bad and I don’t think I can fail because even if the business does, the knowledge I will gain will mark it a success. My first account is slim2n0ne so you know that I’ve been staring into the matrix for a couple months. So please upvote this, help a fellow redditor out. And follow me on /r/stagglabels . This is going to be awesome.

P.s. feel free to ask me questions in the comments and give any advice you want. Thank you so much for reading this!

*Edit- I wanted to talk more about what I want the site to look like. I am inspired by sites like jackthreads.com and fab.com. I like the layout of these sites. I like how they cycle products and have sales. They give you a sense of urgency because you know that everything is limited time offers. Eventually I could see the site moving to a what I call a ""collection"" format. Instead of having 15 to 20 labels on the homepage to buy I would have maybe ten cycling ""collections"" with 15 to 20 labels each. 

Also what do you think you would pay for say... 14 labels, enough for a 12 pack and a couple if you messed up application.     ",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1344984437.0,,,True,t3_y5s9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/y5s9h/today_is_the_day_i_quit_my_job_to_start_a_small/,

1. Do things get easier (because a parent company is there to help you out on the essentials), or is it tougher?

2.

At the beginning, I was doing $7000 per month, which is a good result for a 20 year old I think, but as the online stuff goes, it started dropping to $0. Basically, over a year, I went from $7k to 0$ per month ( not a crash but a steady decline ).

I felt dead, burned out and unmotivated - full of anxiety. I seriously didn't know what to do. I was like an animal forced into a corner. I've had $20k in the bank but I didn't know what to do with it.

Then, I don't remember exactly why, something clicked for me and I started to force myself against those challenges. I've started doing high intensity cardio, stopped eating carbs. I've lost 30 pounds in a few months. 

And I started working on my company again. It was all-in. I've had a ""business partner"" who scammed me in the past. I've severed the ties but he reappeared and maybe he gave me the motivation to fight. To show that I am better.

I've had no income yet I hired my brother full-time (burning on my money)

After a few months my income started reappearing, it was $3k per month, then $5k per month, then $10k per month and then it peaked at $30k per month. I was MANIC. It was really a great turnaround.

Then, the business landscape changed again and the fall was inevitable. The income started declining again - and again - in August 2012 felt to almost $0.

The scammer, which I wanted to beat, met with me and was generally unimpressed with my performance. Even though I was earning 10 times more than him, hiring people(while he still works part-time in a SEO agency) and doing better he acted like he is better and I am not able to do anything. He reads into this whole NLP/PUA bullshit and is pretty delusional but this meeting affected me somehow. He copied my business model inch-by-inch, tried to steal my customers and yet acted like he was better. After it, I felt helpless. Like if all my achievements were for nothing. 

I feel destroyed, unable to act. I can't force myself to invest any money and I really don't know what to do right now. 

I am posting it here to get an outsiders perspective because I really can't see clear paths now.

I am now almost 21yo. - running the business for 2 years, my brother is still working for me and I have $70k in the bank. The income is now below the monthly costs.

How do I regain that will to fight and invest money? How to invest without being afraid?

And guess what? If you don't have a host OR a domain, they're having a sale and will toss in a domain for free. Do it now, cheap-o.

How will you know what changes you need to make or what your most popular clicks are? If you do have GA, check it every month and think of ways to improve your metrics.
* Do you know what SEO is, and do you always use your alt tags? Do you integrate key words into your copy? Do your header tags contain valuable search engine terms, or are they things like 'Welcome' or 'About Us'? Web crawlers care about headers - use that to your advantage.

1333960556.0,62,self.Entrepreneur,s0jn9,"I made 40k working 10 weeks a summer for 6 summers, on my own hours, in my backyard.  Here is what I have learned.  (AMA?)",AcademicPandemic,86,24,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/s0jn9/i_made_40k_working_10_weeks_a_summer_for_6/,"WARNING LONG, TL;DR at end.

Background:I have commented about this story a lot, but I think it is worth sharing details.  I taught swim lessons from ages 14-21 and committed 40 hours a week(max) if I had to do all the scheduling myself(THANKS MOM!).  If I would have done more advertising, expanded to other neighborhoods and hired more teachers than I had, I could have moved from making 10k a summer to at least 20k pretty easily.  Do this year round with multiple teachers in the summer, I could have made 100k a year with the knowledge of a teenager.  After 3 years I had hired 3 extra teachers, filled a 30hr a week schedule and increased my prices 100%.  I made this in response to the post about how long you entrepreneurs work so it might focus on helping you relax a bit.  Also, if you are looking to expand by hiring professionals you may have to tweak this advice so it applies to your scenario.  This is a bit of what I learned.

* Minimize financial overhead.  I spent maybe $20 a year on a clock, toys for the kids, and goggles for myself.  I know this near impossible for a typical business, but not if you put your mind to it.
* If you need help, hire the smartest teenager you can find.  They can do degree worthy work for $12/hr if you teach them the process.  They will be at school so they won't work many hours but they will be able to take care of work that you don't have time for like organizing, stocking, or writing.  Talk to AP(advanced placement) teachers at your local high school if possible.
* Pay them well and include them in your operations.  Kids have great ideas before they get to college and are told they will not work.  They will be eager to help and will cost nothing compared to an experienced professional
* If you need a college degree to do the job, freelance it.  If you know a bit about doing the job yourself, find somebody young and cheap, they will work hard for you.  If you have no idea, find a cheap professional
* If it is repetitive, automate it.  I would schedule lessons by posting the master schedule online, where my clients could access it and modify it as they saw fit.  First come, first serve, somebody showing up at the wrong time was never my fault after the first couple years.
* Make everything as flexible as possible for the customers.  I could have clients pay for every lesson up front, at the end of the summer, or $52.41 at a time.
* I cannot stress this enough, make a product to serve the market not the other way around.  
* Word of mouth will be your best advertiser and it is free.  A family from Korea contacted me 2 weeks before moving to America because of word of mouth.
* Treat your customers like your parents.  Free repairs, advise, coffee, whatever make them remember you and come back for more.  If it doesn't cost you too much and it isn't your main product/service, it should be free.
* If you have public space, give your clients a reason to stay around your store, even if they are not going to buy anything.  You can get to know them if the time is right and they will see you enjoying your work.
* You might have a product, but your selling that product is a service and it can always be improved for free, you just have to be creative.
* Do something unique and helpful and do not expect anything in return.  Articles in the newspaper got me business willing to drive 30 minutes for lessons

Thanks for reading.  Like I said, I love helping people so feel free to ask me any questions you have about your business or mine.  This is an on going offer if you ever want advice about your business I would love to brainstorm with you.  Think of it as free consulting that you don't have to pay for.


**TL:DR** Don't spend a lot on one thing. Hire very young, pay well (for them).  Automate as much as possible.  Make your customers remember you as a person not a product.  Meet an unmet demand, don't create a demand.  Word-of-mouth is the best advertisement.  Don't just smile, be genuinely happy about what you do.  If possible, donate your service on weekends to those in need.


**EDIT: Blanket answer of questions asked to me.  No i didn't have insurance, no I didn't set up an LLC and no i didn't rent my own pool or pay taxes (I suggested all of this to my parents at 16).  I wanted to keep living with my parents during high school, and as long as we had a pool I was going to use it.  Also, I apologize if I sound stuck up, I am simply trying to use some decent grammar.  I thank the people who took the time to explain why some of the things I learned would not hold up in the real world.  I am surprised how rude many of you were, but understand if it was because I came off with a similar tone.  Also, yes, I did spend my money very quickly on what many of you may consider stupid things.  However, spreading the wealth to my less fortunate friends so they could partake in the adventures of childhood with me continues to bring me a lot of pleasure.  I now understand that this is a subreddit for adult entrepreneurs that does not seem to welcome the money making opportunities utilized by young entrepreneurs.  I wish we could have spoken more of the entrepreneurial aspect of my experience instead of just the fact that my parents were willing to take the risk to let me have this awesome experience.  I am glad it went swimmingly and everybody got what they wanted from it.**",,False,self,t5_2qldo,True,,,True,t3_s0jn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/s0jn9/i_made_40k_working_10_weeks_a_summer_for_6/,

that said, I sort of want to use the down time to get started on something that I have an interest in, but did not actively pursue: crafting trinkets (charm bracelets and the like, very suitable for etsy)

that said, I feel scared about the future and unsure of my next steps. should I try to do this full time since I don't have a full time job and if things move real slow, supplement with a part time job OR get a full time job where I have a background in and do crafts part time? my only worry is I will start feeling tired from my day job, give excuses to not start and drop off.

as it is, with a free day today, I feel lost. I realized its probably helpful to set up a routine daily of things to do so as to feel productive and better but all I can bring myself to do is to wallow in my own misery.

the other concern is I have very limited savings to sustain myself and this makes me feel inclined to bury myself in another 9-5 job. 

what should I do?

tl;dr - probably needs a stern boot up my bum and some help to decide if to start doing my own thing or get another 9-5 after getting laid off.

[edit]
thanks for all the very insightful, helpful, thoughtful and constructive comments! it gives me a better idea of what to plan for realistically. and also how to position my craft ideas (less trinkets, more higher end insert-name item) which i haven't actively given much thought to. i appreciate those who have taken time out to leave their comments here. it has helped me. :)",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1362538948.0,,,True,t3_19pca5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/19pca5/just_got_laid_off_feeling_scared_and_bummed_out/,

1357350369.0,62,self.Entrepreneur,15zg51,I'm the Noteboard guy -- I run a business full-time that started only thanks to Reddit and keeps going viral. I could really use some advice!,robertgfthomas,76,14,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/15zg51/im_the_noteboard_guy_i_run_a_business_fulltime/,"I sell [Noteboards through RGFT.net](http://www.rgft.net). They're whiteboards/dry-erase calendars/RPG battlemats/a bunch of other stuff all in one neat little $10 doohickey that folds up to fit in your pocket.

I've sold about 12,000 of these since last March without having to do any marketing whatsoever because these keep going viral on the internet (TechCrunch, HuffPo, Gizmodo, Entrepreneur, etc.).

12,000 units isn't as much money as it sounds like it should be -- I'm a really frugal person, and am making exactly enough for me to pay rent and live more-or-less contentedly. I'm the sole employee and run this schtick out of the basement in the house I share with three other dudes.

All along, I've been super, super, super paranoid about the legality of everything -- especially now that I've started to try to do international shipping and that tax season is coming up. My business experience is pretty much zero, so I've been learning all this stuff on the fly.

It's fun on the one hand, but on the other hand with such a tiny budget, I'm terrified of two big things:

* I'm forgetting to file (or am incorrectly filing) some tax form, and am going to get saddled with a bigass penalty that I can't afford to pay.

* I'm using the US Postal Service to mail things internationally since it's the least expensive service, but my shipments aren't getting to their destinations because the USPS isn't reliable or because I'm missing the proper paperwork.

*That said*, I have yet to have to pay any sort of tax penalty and I've only had one report of an order not getting to its destination -- from a guy in Canada who placed the order two weeks ago, so I suspect the package just got held up around Christmas.

But when you're living by the seat of your pants and spend all day thinking about your business and sole source of income, you tend to worry a lot. And while I've read the snot out of pretty much every online publication on taxes and shipping, I'm still not sure of the right answers (which could mean I'm just overthinking everything, but is still worrisome).

So here are my big questions:

* How can I be positive of what taxes I need to file? As a tiny-ass single-person wholesale/retail business I'm a ""disregarded entity"", and have this list so far (not including state taxes/sales tax):
  * **Annually:**
  * 1040 (Fed Tax Return)
  * 1040, Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business)
  * 1040, Schedule SE (Fed Self-Employment Tax)
  * 940 (Federal Unemployment Tax Return)
  * **Less-than-annually:**
  * 1040-ES (Estimated Income Tax)
  * 941 (Social Security &amp; Medicare Deposits)

* Are there any inexpensive alternatives to the USPS for international shipping? I *love* the Postal Service, but I also really love that FedEx and UPS have tracking numbers for every single package from point-to-point, regardless of size.

* I'm having a lot of fun doing this in spite of my complaining, but I'd love for some big established business to come along and buy my trademark, patent, and customer base so they can help Noteboards reach their potential better than I ever could. Who should I contact and how?

Thanks!

1348126983.0,59,self.Entrepreneur,106lcf,"I had an idea for improving the /r/entrepreneur subreddit, what do you guys think?",sesteele,78,19,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/106lcf/i_had_an_idea_for_improving_the_rentrepreneur/,"I just had a really fun conversation with a fellow /r/entrepreneur reader. I initially thought I would spend a few minutes with them and give them some idea of what's going on in my industry. The call lasted more than two hours and was really awesome. I probably talked way more than he wanted, but I enjoy the act of sharing what I do in a more real time interactive manner. 

So that leads me to what my idea was. Would /r/entrepreneur be interested in a regular webcast/google+ group hang/conference call where one person presented a topic and their insight and then had a Q&amp;A session. 

I just like the idea of keeping it fairly informal, but allow us to share insight and information in a more natural way than through a forum. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but it lacks a certain linear progression that you get with a group discussion. 

So what does everyone think, what topics would people be interested in?

**Edit 1** Okay, so there seems to be a good response to this here. After thinking about it over night and trying to come up with the best way to do this, I think I have figured it out. I don't want this to be a chat free for all. it's going to get obnoxious. What I'm looking for is a few people presenting on what they are passionate about, their business.

So with that all in mind, this is my thought.

1. The discussion will be a panel type presentation. I think three people would be perfect to be the panel. The reason for this is fairly simple. I want there to be enough content to get people to be involved, but I don't want there to be a need for someone to put together an hour long presentation. Also, when there are questions, there will be multiple sources for the answer, alternative view points and possibly multiple insights. 

2. The presentation will be scheduled out. I'm not sure how frequently to do this. If I manage it, it can't take away from what I normally do. So I can't see doing it any more frequently than once every other week. However, that may be pushing. Once a month is probably good for everyone involved. 

3. I like the idea of video chat. I want there to be face to face discussion. The way people talk about things when they aren't casually typing it out in a chat room is so much more natural. Sorry, that means not IRC (yes IRC for the win and all). Really, you can't give a presentation in IRC anyway. 

4. The format I see is this. I think we can give control to the panel members and the moderator for who has video. I would hope there is a chat function also, so people who don't have web cams can still participate. Each panel member will be given 10-15 minutes to talk about their topic. Once the panel has presented, then we will have a Q&amp;A period. You must sign up for the Q&amp;A and the moderator will keep track of that. The person will either ask their question via the chat, or via video. They have the opportunity for a follow up question, but it must be related to the first question directly. In other words, one topic at a time so you can't hog the discussion. Then we will offer breakout sessions with the presenters after say 30 minutes of Q&amp;A. Those can be conducted however, even in IRC (IRC for the WIN). 

5. As a side, I think it's only fair that we offer the presenters something. So since I'm leaning toward having a page facebook and google+ page for this discussion, I guess we can offer them one free link to their website. Hey, SEO bonuses are always nice. Maybe we can also supliment it with a company bio as well. That way they can get the word out. 

That's my thoughts so far. I'll flesh it out more as I work on it. ",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1348166385.0,,,True,t3_106lcf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/106lcf/i_had_an_idea_for_improving_the_rentrepreneur/,

Long time silent up-voter here. Do you want to help choose and build a startup here through Reddit?

[Well then it's nice to meet you!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC3FwVJj9kk)

**Upvote your choice:** It could be a number of things - preferably something that requires minimal startup capital, can be replicated by other Redditors, and is something I am able to do.

What I can do:

- I'm a member at [Techshop](http://youtu.be/-IJn8C2xY0A) and can use or know people that can use the prototyping tools there.
- I'm part of the [Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge) community, and can or know people that can hack most electronics.
- I've got access to Arduino supplies through my [Danish company](http://mememaker.com/)
- For storage/larger projects, there is also my [father in law's garage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JutNcDzDfOk). 
- For 3D printing, there is [Type A Machines](http://typeamachines.com/), where I work.
- I used to work as a teacher, teaching creative project, process, leadership and business design at the [KaosPilots](http://www.kaospilot.dk/in-brief_cp.aspx) in Denmark. 

There are lots of things I can't do. But maybe you can help or teach us as we progress?

**TL;DW Upvote the idea below you think is best, submit your own, discuss, give advice and help as we do it. If it works, do the same in your area!**
 

   

UPDATE: WOW - thanks for all the feedback! Great ideas all round here: really makes me glad I did this. I'm going to give this a day or so over the weekend so everyone has a chance to see/ comment, and then get started. Ultimately I would love to do all the projects, though I do need to prioritize my time, and will do so following your (upvoted) recommendations. One question: do you guys think I should create a new post when I start, or continue posting here?

The original idea was to instantly connect information seekers with information sources (teachers and students). Imagine a knowledge ebay where you can find, review and take classes with teachers instantly via a virtual classroom. We wanted video chat, slide sharing, screen casting and whiteboards, a true virtual classroom. Teachers could teach classes for cash or for free, 1 on 1 or groups.. it was going to be great!  

We failed. It took 4 months and bunch of money to finally admit defeat, but one day my Co-Founder and I just looked at each other and knew we had to make a change. So we reorganized our team, changed our business model and came up with a lean MVP. The new model was an engagement platform where influencers could easily connect with their audience via secure video chat or phone. Influencers could still charge for their time and hold multi person class. We defined influencers as anyone with an audience. After 8 months we finally finished.

I'm not an expert on building startups and have a long way to go, but I know how scary that first step can be. It was for me. I'd like to offer help and motivation to anyone trying to take that first step. Having access to mentors/advisors got me to this point. I'd be happy to talk about my experiences here or via phone/web chat at www.snapclass.com (my site).

I am currently trying to get a restraining order for the threats and include my clients in the ""stay away order"" (kicking her out of east county) but because I can't prove that she has broken in to my home and car in 2010, or that she will act on the threats (I have installed a video system at my home and have a call recorder on my cell if she calls or tries to break in again). Because of the lack of proof, of ""Imminent Threat"", I am having trouble getting a judge to even get a court date. I have had a TRO from 2010, on her for 3 months, after she broke in to my house, the county sheriff's where unable to serve her as she runs do to warrants and lawsuits against her. I was left with little choice but to let it laps. From Jan 2011 to Feb 2012 she was in jail. I also have contacted her probation officer with no forward progress.

___________________________

I have been well and truly addicted to the internet for years. My willpower to resist it is a sad joke. I waste way too much time online as it is, and now that I'm running a business from home, it's even easier to blow entire days on a bunch of stupid useless web browsing, with reddit as the very worst bottomless pit offender. 

I knew I could edit the hosts file to block a site, but it's just as easy to unblock it and annoying to keep up with, so I was looking for something that would let me spend a little time each day on my time-wasting sites, because let's not get crazy here, we need breaks, but would cut it off for the rest of the day after a set threshold was reached. Found it!

Not new, but new to me, is a Firefox extension called [**LeechBlock**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/). I installed it this morning to test it out. You enter the offending site domains, say whether you want to block them during certain time periods or after a certain threshold is reached in a period you select (hour, 12 hours, 24 hours, week, etc.) or both, pick the days of the week you want the rule applied, and then tell it whether you want to be able to fiddle with those settings while you are being blocked. (Say no, of course). 

If you go to visit a culprit site while it's on lockdown, you see a default LeechBlock page. But you can change that to a blank or to any other page.  So I chose [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/ypVPa.jpg) (credit: the internet). Very effective! I was typing away just now, making another unnecessary comment in a favorite sub and WHAM, as I'm typing, my four open reddit tabs all reload to show the above image and I can't reddit anymore until this time tomorrow. It really was just what I needed. I had chosen an hourlong time limit for a group of my favorite sites and hadn't realized it had been anywhere near that long. But that's how it works, doesn't it? You wake up and get on reddit and before you know it it's 4pm and the day is gone and you've done nothing but fuck off on the internet. And your deadline jumps closer and the job isn't any closer to being done. So this is perfect. I can't wait to see what this does for my productivity and for stuff like making time to exercise and cook proper meals and all instead of obsessively clicking around for new content on reddit.

Note that you can have different sites or groups of sites that have different limits and rules. I put all of my worst sites in one basket together and figured out the hard way that my hourlong visit to reddit used up all the time I was allowed to spend on any of those sites in this 24 hour period. If you wanted more flexibility, like say an hour on reddit per day and an hour on facebook or whatever, you would just set them up in different groups. That way redditing doesn't count against facebooking etc. Or just go hardcore and say ""all I get is 1 hour of bullshit per day no matter what it is"" or ""absolutely no bullshit timewasting sites from 8-12am and from 1-9pm"" or whatever.

You may ask, ""How are you here telling us this if you're being blocked right now and can't edit the settings?"" Well... I'm on my other computer. Shame shame, I know. But I use two at once side by side. So I'm about to install LeechBlocker on this one too. I guess what I'll do is block one computer entirely and give the other an hour per day. Or maybe I'll go half and half. But either way I don't want the ability to cheat. There's always my phone to cheat with but I know I won't do that except on the toilet or on a meal break. I don't get on my phone here at my desk except for calls/texts. We'll see if that lasts when the computers are both blocking my crack.

Anyway, I hope this helps you other addicted wretches who are watching yourselves piss away too much time that you need to be using to keep yourself in business (or school, or whatever).",,False,self,t5_2qldo,True,,,True,t3_soi5l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/soi5l/get_back_to_work_an_excellent_way_to_keep/,

The bottom line is that I want to be successful and for money to no longer be an issue (as I'm sure most people do). I tell myself I would give anything to be in that situation - work as hard as I need for as long as necessary - but one thing always holds me back - my self-belief.

As much as I believe it's the way my life should be, I don't have any confidence in myself so I can never take the first step or trust my decisions on what kind of business to start up. I'm so convinced I'll mess it up that even thinking about it makes me anxious and I give up straight away.

I know I'm not lazy - I work like a beast on things I believe in... but I fear I'll never be confident enough to go ahead with any entrepreneurial pursuits.

Does anyone else feel like this? Is there any hope for me at all? How do I overcome this debilitating lack of self-confidence?

So, since it seemed people [found my link-collecting habit useful](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/tb8v6/rentrepreneur_new_site_collecting_the_most_useful/), I thought I'd share a few of the best entrepreneurship-focused links I've found over the last week. 

Let me know if this sort of thing's helpful, and if it is I can consider making it a weekly/bi-weekly feature or something. 

BTW - none of these links are affiliate links, and I'm not being paid to promote them. A couple of them link to IM Gourmet, my site, but only for roundup posts where I'd otherwise have to spam 5 or more additional links in here. 

###General Entrepreneurship Focus

* [Ever have trouble making business decisions?](http://blog.asmartbear.com/business-tiebreaker.html?) Jason Cohen writes a fantastic article focusing on a metric that he says (and I agree) should get much more attention than it does. 
* [It's Income Report time for May](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com/roundup-income-reports-for-may-from-around-the-web/). I love the tradition that Pat Flynn started and several other entrepreneurs now do too - breaking down *exactly* how much money they earned each month and through what channels. Really useful hard data. 
* [Can Tim Ferriss's ""Muse"" idea actually work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/tczzw/is_anyone_here_making_a_musestyle_business_ala/) Tim ""Four Hour Work Week"" Ferriss gets a pretty hard time in the entrepreneurial world, but this discussion of his ""muse"" passive income idea - from some site called ""Reddit"" :) - had tons of interesting data and success stories. 

###Traffic-building

* [Google says that negative SEO almost never works](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com/google-says-negative-seo-almost-never-works-plus-penguin-advice-from-the-source/) - plus a whole bunch of other useful information on Penguin, straight from the source, Matt Cutts himself. 
* [Introduction to mobile app marketing](http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/05/10/the-beginners-guide-to-mobile-app-marketing/?) - Neil Patel of Quicksprout (who has had more than a bit of success in this field) writes a massive article covering absolutely everything you need to know about marketing apps. Introductory-level, but tremendously complete. 
* [HOWTO blog controversially without being flamed to death](http://pushingsocial.com/flag-planting-content?) - interesting piece about how to take controversial stances in blogging without getting the hate-mail that follows - but still getting the traffic. 
* [Are you using Twitter Chats yet?](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/twitter-chat-guide/) - if you're in an  appropriate market, Twitter chats kick ass as a way to build a community. This article provides a really complete look at running them and getting the most out of them. 

###Making Sales

* [Want to make more money out of the same customers?](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/boost-average-order-value/?) - A great piece on increasing Average Order Value per customer - goes a fair way beyond ""upsell something!"". 
* [An excellent practical example of benefit-focused sales copy](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/11/build-blog-products-that-sell-6-tell-the-world/?) - This one is pretty introduction-level in many ways, but features a really superb example of taking boring sales copy for a mundane product and turning it into something awesome. Filed under ""swipe file"" for me. 

###Why are you doing this again?

Excellent question. I run a site called [Internet Marketing Gourmet](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com), where I sift through hundreds of blog posts on all things entrepreneur, every week (last week I read more than 800 posts), and summarise the best ones I find for anyone who needs good ideas and advice, but doesn't have time to spend hours reading the Interwebs. 

Last week we ended up featuring 39 of those articles, each with explanatory text - some list posts like this one, some full feature articles with additional commentary and facts - so that you can immediately find the articles that will be useful to you, using a bit more information than just a Twitter retweet or a headline alone. 

**TL:DR** - we're kinda BoingBoing for internet entrepreneurs.

1356990706.0,56,self.Entrepreneur,15qs5w,What are the best-kept secrets about startups? 2012 Edition.,andrewbellay,67,11,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/15qs5w/what_are_the_bestkept_secrets_about_startups_2012/,"First off - there's no magic to start-ups.

The best kept secret about start-ups (especially for first time entrepreneurs) is that you don't have to re-invent the wheel to be successful.

It's a secret because, in my experience, young entrepreneurs don't want to hear the advice that someone has already solved 98% of the problem you want to tackle and that they should focus on the remaining 2% to increase their odds of success.

2 Quick Examples:
1) Website - every start-up wants a super flashy website (even if they're not a web company) and so they invest tens or hundreds of hours into making the ""perfect"" website (which they typically don't have the in house skills to make). The end result is that they have a mediocre website and wasted tens/hundreds  of hours instead of doing customer development. Time and money would have been better spent on a $50 Wordpress theme (that doesn't even look like Wordpress) and 2 hours to setup the site. You can, literally, launch a Wordpress site on a brand new domain and get basic content on it in 20 minutes.

2) Fundraising - same tune here. Every start-up's dream is to raise money. Why? Primarily, pride. If more start-ups spent their time focused on adding value to their customers, more would get funding! Investors want a return on their investment, not another cool sticker for their MacBook Air!

I hear this all the time: ""How will I know if my customers will like it until I've built it?"" The answer is ""rapid-prototyping"" (aka ""just fake it""). Do you really want to invest all the time and effort it takes to make a product only to find out no one wants it? Well you may want to, but I wouldn't invest in that entrepreneurial process. Savvy founders find ways to demonstrate demand before they build.

Examples include:
Man Behind the Machine (aka artificial artificial intelligence): You hypothesize that you can grow your customer base by give existing users rewards for tweeting at your Twitter account when they achieve the next level? (or whatever, just an example) Go manually give rewards to the users instead building a complex feature with many moving parts (back end integration, API integration, cron jobs...etc). Sure, it's hard work, but it's smarter than building a feature based on your gut.

Fake Landing Pages: You want to test your price point, product descriptions, images, names. Make a quick and dirty page with the info you're testing and then force the user to click a well-defined call to action (""Buy now"", ""Subscribe""). Collect their info and then send them to a ""product not available"" or ""out of stock"" page.

Mock-ups (aka looks-like, feels-like): Did you know that the very first Palm Pilot was a block of wood? Jeff Hawkins walked around for a full month with a hunk of wood in his pocket, literally stopping on street corners, imagining what his life would be like if he actually built one. Cost: A BLOCK OF WOOD.

Focus on high ROI experiments. 
Hypothesize, predict, test, analyze, repeat.

**Bottom Line:** The best generic piece of advice I can give to the founders of a start-up is to focus on adding value to their customers in such a way that the start-up can capture a piece of that value (aka monetize). 
If you spend your time and energy seeking out something customers will pay for (instead of on your website, wasting your lawyer's time, premature fundraising, over-engineering your product, etc), then I can guarantee that you'll learn a hell of a lot and be much more likely to be successful.

Categories: Basics, Planning &amp; Tracking, Strategies &amp; Channels, Sales, Analysis, Other

1. Branding - Develop a crisp, memorable brand with your logo, motto (based on USP), website, colors, tone and other marketing materials. Defining your USP is crucial to this process. Important graphics such as the logo should be vectorized. Research and pay attention to discover if your industry's customers want a fun, professional image or something else. Create letterheads, business cards, uniforms, debrief/thank you packets and other paraphernalia to build your credibility. Distribute business cards to every employee. Consider magnetic signs for the main company vehicles. Use photos of employees and management to build personality and trust. Obtain a local or 800 contact phone number and email address. Free phone numbers for receiving calls are available from Google Voice. Based on this branding, you should have streamlined materials to give your clients at different stages throughout the relationship. 

2. Online Presence - List your website and contact information across free locations and register useful free products. These include: Yelp, Yellow Pages, Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter (at least register name), Facebook (at least register name), Bing, Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Flickr, YouTube, LinkedIn. Connect the Analytics account to your website immediately to begin tracking all traffic. Join networks and forums related to your customers and begin contributing genuinely valuable content. Make sure your website collects emails through some mechanism.

3. Physical Presence - List your information in the local service or business directory. Join networks or clubs related to your customers and begin contributing genuinely valuable content.

4. Referrals - Plan/execute a referral strategy for your customers. This may include business cards, personal notes, special repeat-purchase deals, thank you notes, gifts, gift cards, a ""referral program"", continuous contact drips, birthday cards etc. Develop a relationship with important customers. High-quality work performance is obviously necessary. Be sure to repeat and emphasize that ""we rely on referrals for our new clients"".

5. SEO - Follow technical procedures, produce relevant content, promote connections and link-building. .......

6. Farmers Markets - A good stepping stone during the early development phase. Cheap (especially with DIY-labor), low entry barrier, offers customer interaction, repeated exposure to regular visitors, acts as an early feedback mechanism and is useful for developing a record of sales receipts or general traction. Generally requires a tent, table, chair, tablecloth and presentation/sales display. Ask customers to fill out questionnaires with valuable information such as grocery store shopping habits, email addresses and packaging or pricing preferences. Use this information for product development and to convince distributors.

7. Direct Mail -

8. Email Marketing - Constant contact, Mailchimp, [Mailchimp Resource Center](http://mailchimp.com/resources/)

9. Adwords -

        * Use Google Keyword tool and target keywords with traffic
        * If you use broad match, be prepared to have a large amount of bad traffic 
        * Use the search query report to find out what people actually typed to trigger your keyword
        * Make negative keyword lists based on all the bad keywords from the step above
        * If budget is less than $1000/month it might be a good idea to use phrase match targeting 
        * See which keywords get good CTR's or conversions and change those to phrase match
        * Use tightly grouped ad groups tied to landing pages with matching features
        * Try to match title, url, heading tags, bold/italics/underline when possible (do not overkill)
        * Find load speed on Google's Page Speed tool; it affects Quality Score and thus price for positions
        * Use Google Analytics and link it to your Adwords account without delay
        * Use Analytics goal tracking to track signups or sales or any goal
        * Use Adwords Conversion tracking
        * Click through rate affects Quality Score so periodically remove ads that don't convert
        * Don't make the mistake of making a small campaign. Make a ton of variations on an ad 
        * Tweak and test headlines, ad copy and display url all affect CTR. Test variations and optimize
        * In the beginning you may not get conversions, so...
        * Optimize Ad CTR, keyword CTR, and Quality Score to lower costs and increase potential success
        * If a keyword does not bring enough traffic, scrap it in favor of getting useful data 
        * Act on numbers, not on emotion. Don't get attached to ads and refuse to scrap them
        * For small budgets, focus on one type of campaign to provide enough data (search *or* display)
        * Find out keywords used by competitors and consider bidding on their brand or trademark names

Over the years I've noticed a lot of scary stories about accounts being suspended without much reason but have come to the conclusion that most of these stories end with the site having legitimate breaches of ToS (it's still kind of shitty of Google to give them no prior notice and not tell them why they're suspended).

I've since been VERY meticulously reading terms of service and have always been sure to follow them 100% but last week my account was suspended without reason and today my appeal was denied without reason and Google has stated they will not communicate with me any further on this issue.

I've made thousands of dollars with Google AdSense and have been very loyal to them and it's just pretty shitty that they would do this to me with no explanation.  I'm truly baffled as to why my account was suspended.

I run a couple community forums and the only guess I have is that one of our angry users purposely clicked a bunch of our ads to get our account suspended (we recently had a bunch of drama where a few users very angrily left and wanted our forum shut down).  I mentioned that in the appeal but Google ignored it and wouldn't even tell me if that was the reason.

I understand they have to look out for their advertisers, but their opaqueness in this situation to someone who has put so much effort into following their terms, has used their services for years, and has made them tens of thousands of dollars is honestly just very hurtful and insulting :(

I was about to relaunch our site too and run a $1000 AdWords campaign but I'm too upset with Google to use their Ad services ever again I think.

Anyway this is just a warning.  Even if you think you're following the ToS and even if you're a well above average user, Google can and will still suspend your account permanently without warning and will be very rude/impersonal and opaque about it.  Have a backup plan just in case (e.g. accounts with several different advertisers).

1363806321.0,52,self.Entrepreneur,1aoi1r,r/entrepreneur - Don't be Afraid of the IRS (a primer on small business taxes),engmama,59,7,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1aoi1r/rentrepreneur_dont_be_afraid_of_the_irs_a_primer/,"It seems like every week, someone is getting or giving advice about how scary and mean the IRS is.  I'm here to tell you that at the level most of us are working at (my sales are less than $3M a year), the IRS is a very friendly place.  

The best thing you can do, if you're nervous about the paperwork surrounding taxes, is to take 2 hours and read the [IRS Small Business Tax Guide.](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/index.html)

Know what you need to pay, when you need to pay it, and make sure you are signed up for e-filing. If you don't understand something, call their help line.  They are surprisingly helpful.  

If you find yourself in a bind and can't pay what you owe, call them.  They are surprisingly willing to work with you on payment plans.  Yes, you'll have penalties and interest.  But it's more reasonable than any bank. 

If you make a mistake, fix it.  You might have to pay a penalty if you underpaid taxes, but not ""end of the world"" penalties. 

If you are politically inclined to not pay taxes, you are hiding a lot of income, and breaking all the laws, then the IRS can be a scary thing. If you are a small business owner trying to do right, the IRS is just another bureaucracy.  Their agents are people like you and me doing a job.  Make their job easy by keeping good records and showing intent to follow the rules, and they will be easy to work with.

Source: Personally was audited twice because of making mistakes in my business return (and then got smart and started using an accountant).  Went on a 2 year payment plan in the 5-digits.  Survived.


**Edit:** I would just like to emphasize that this advice is for new businesses.  If you can afford an accountant (or if you have a complex situation), by all means, that is the best route.  However, as the audit rate for people making under $100K annually is less than 1%, I stand by the idea that you, as a beginning businessperson, can put forward a reasonable amount of effort and do your own taxes.  **Rather, don't let the fear of taxes or the inability to hire an accountant paralyze you from action.** It's not rocket science.  I also believe that you get what you give.  If you approach another human being with annoyance and disrespect, or go into a situation expecting a confrontation, you are far less likely to get a positive outcome.

Some background:

As big GoT fans, we were excited to see [throne toilet seat](http://www.etsy.com/listing/104356743/game-of-thrones-inspired-toilet-decal) become successful fan art, and decided to go ahead and design/ produce our own Iron Throne inspired phone dock. In order to emphasize our ‘Do-It-Yourself’ process, we posted a high level [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Iron-Throne-Dock-for-your-Iphone-and-your-mobi/) detailing each step.

That tutorial garnered some bloggers’ attention ([Mary Sue](http://www.themarysue.com/iron-throne-phone-dock/), [nerdapproved](http://nerdapproved.com/cellphones/an-iron-throne-to-dock-your-phone/), etc links), which snowballed until [Wired.com](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/01/game-of-thrones-smartphone-dock/) featured our phone dock in January. We were ecstatic and continued refining the phone dock design, while simultaneously accepting pre-orders.

Yesterday we received this cease and desist[letter](http://imgur.com/x6gkbzB), which brings us back to the fork in the road.. we thought by labeling it as ‘inspired’ it was clearly not attempting to dupe potential customers into thinking this was officially licensed merchandise. Is there any room for negotiations, or is this project canned?

I have a yardwork business and a few weeks ago I decided to make some fancy flyers to get the word out. I spent a while designing [them](http://i.imgur.com/Gi8rn.jpg) and spent $30 or so getting 100 printed up on glossy 100lb cardstock. I then spent a few hours distributing 50 of them in mailboxes of a nearby neighborhood (don't do the mailbox thing, apparently it's a federal crime.) Result of these flyers: not a single call. Nothing. I was bummed.

Today I had another idea and decided to try a similar tactic. I spent around 10 minutes designing [these](http://i.imgur.com/nk1Bp.png). I ran to my local craft store, bought a package of [colorful cardstock](http://www.joann.com/images/11/26/6/xprd11266780_z.jpg) for $4 and printed out 30 on my crappy home laser printer. I cut holes and the top and went around putting them on the doorhandles of houses around another neighborhood. Just a few hours later I had already netted 3 jobs.

Moral of the story: Don't beat around the bush. In a situation like mine people don't care about ""professional yardwork services"" and setting up appointments. They want ""a good looking lawn"". Sure it might not work for everyone, but it worked for me. Secondary moral: try different things even if you're not sure about it and especially if it isn't a high investment.

None of its true. But they have the resources to drag it out forever. It's just motion after motion at this point to try and drain me. I have no idea why. 

Currently nothing has been leaked to the press, and really I can't see that doing much for me either way. My issue is cashflow. I can't keep fighting this without any resources. The only way to get resources is to start nailing some sales.

Alright Reddit, I need your help.

My company launched to the public in December in the midst of a lawsuit - check it out online here: [Inklyo.com](http://www.inklyo.com) (would love to hear any feedback!). I won't get into details since the case is ongoing, but the basics are I'm essentially a one-woman company and I'm being bullied by a multi-million dollar company. They're bleeding my bank account dry.

At this point, my legal fees have completely annihilated my marketing budget, so that even though I'm now live and operational, I can't finance any direct marketing campaigns to get the ball rolling and to start building market share. I'm also a 27 year old Canadian female... I have little to no klout in the online marketing world and no real reputable contacts to leverage. As such, I'm looking for any advice, lead, or ideas as to how I can either connect with some notable folks in my target market (more on that below) or get some much needed coverage from some reputable blogs. I need some serious uplift, and I need it asap.

I'm hoping that's where you guys can help me out.

About Inklyo: My company is designed to provide content development and copywriting outsourcing support specifically to marketing agencies and consultants - English only at this point. We are NOT a content farm - I've developed a system that enables me to employ and manage top notch writers, and makes it easy for those in the marketing industry to find writing support (minus the headaches normally associated with freelance). 

We produce high quality content, and I pay my writers fairly. We don't write student essays, and we won't revamp your resume - we only create legitimate marketing content. I oversee all orders at this point, and we have some pretty stringent quality assurance measures in place.

About me: I'm a 27 year old female entrepreneur in Canada. I've bootstrapped this puppy from the ground up and am quite proud of the results. Without the lawsuit, I would have launched without debt and without angel funding. Now that I'm in a lawsuit, getting financing is hard, and since I don't have a lot of sales, seeking investment is impossible - unless you considering giving the company away a fair trade.

I'm stuck, but I don't want to give up. I'm confident we'll eventually win the lawsuit, but I have no idea how long that will take, and even when we win, I'm worried that I'll be left with a pile of debt and a company that missed its window.

Anyone out there have any thoughts on ways to get some uplift?",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1362524967.0,,,True,t3_19pyg0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/19pyg0/so_my_startup_is_getting_sued_need_to_scale_and/,

2) Are you making obstacles or finding solutions? There's always problems, deal with them. Perfectionism CAN hurt you. You got the whole future for developments and making things better.

3) Time. The most important factor. Doesn't matter how big or how small, or how fricken awesome or how big a need. Even when you have gold in your hands it will take time and a lot of work before it gets anywhere. 

Don't get discouraged. Keep at it, stick to something you're passionate about, and by all means don't quit the day job until AFTER your success!

AMA.,I2GConsulting,58,9,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/132jnj/iama_an_external_funding_specialist_i_have/,"I am an external funding specialist, and I have negotiated business incentive deals worth millions of dollars on behalf of large and small companies all around the world. 

In a nutshell, when a company builds a new factory, hires new employees, refurbishes an existing office, launches a new product, carries out R&amp;D, all these activities are eligible for funding from public authorities at different levels (Federal, State, county, municipal)...I negotiated these deals with the relevant authorities: in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, Asia. 

This involved a lot of negotiations with different countries at the same time: you wanted to get the best offer from one country so as to obtain more money from the country you really wanted to invest in.

I don't know what type of verification I can provide, but perhaps the MODs can suggest something. 

**Edit:** clarification. 

**Edit 2:** since I received a few private messages and comments about what are the company activities that most commonly receive funding, and what is the funding available, [here you will find two documents to download](http://i2gconsulting.com/downloads/): the first is a two-pager explaining what activities can be funded, and what are the conditions that normally apply; the second document is a presentation that explains how funding works, what is the process, and it also has an annex with more detailed info on a number of US States: as of slide No. 6 (I have similar slides for other countries/States, so let me know if you have specific questions).

",friendlyfire,56,9,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ton3e/how_a_local_entrepreneur_crashed_and_burned_aka_a/,"I know this is common sense, but apparently everyone doesn't know this: If your loss prevention techniques make your legitimate customers feel uncomfortable or even afraid, you are doing something seriously wrong.  
 
There was a dollar pizza place that opened up right by my work. If you're not familiar with the model they rent very small spaces, sell $1 slices, $2.75 for two slices and a soda and rely on HIGH volume (and cheap ingredients) for their profits. 
 
It was an excellent area for it. No other low cost competitors. Very high foot traffic. I started going there for the cheap pizza. The owner was friendly and he had some of his family working there with him. I kept going back over the next two weeks even though it was pretty busy (lines 10+ deep out the door) because it was a) cheap, b) friendly, c) pretty fast even with the lines and d) I wanted to promote cheaper food alternatives in my area. 
 
The place was doing really well. 
 
Unfortunately, they were hit by a string of counterfeit $20 bills. The owner was pretty upset. 
 
So what did he do? 
 
Reasonable response: Get one of those markers that detects counterfeits. Check all large currency bills and continue with business as usual.  
 
Completely unreasonable response: Get one of those markers that detects counterfeits. Put up multiple signs stating that if you were caught passing a counterfeit bill you would be physically detained until the cops arrived. Stop being friendly and start treating all your customers with suspicion, especially when they pay with a $10 or $20 bill. Tell everyone who will listen that you're itching to catch someone paying with a counterfeit bill because you want to beat them up.
 
Now, I have personally never been in the possession of a counterfeit $20 but my brother has gotten them a couple times in his change and I've known other people who have received them. It sucks. The idea the guy would beat up a legitimate customer because THEY were the victims of counterfeiting pissed me off.  
 
I never went there again because I didn't like being treated like a criminal when I had done nothing wrong. And apparently other people felt the same day because within three days of this they went from having a line out the door every single day at lunch time to being a ghost town. Every time I walked past there was maybe 1-2 people inside.  
 
I have rarely been happy to see a place shut down, but I was so glad when that place did less than two months later. 
 
Several months after that a new dollar pizza place opened with a new owner and has been doing quite well. 
 
If that first dollar slice pizza entrepreneur is out there: Yes, counterfeiters killed your business - but only because of your response to the situation which completely alienated your legitimate customers.

I started a fashion line nearly 2 years ago under the name ""B:UNIQ Clothing"" (be unique). I had started with a partner and we had an investor (his friend, Matt) a marketer and someone to run the operations. 

Over time, we gained some traction in popularity, locally. We were in XXL magazine twice (very famous hip hop magazine). One of our shirts was featured in the spotlight section, and we had an ad in another issue. 

Over time, things started falling apart mainly because we ran the business like chickens with our heads cut off. My partner and I never saw eye to eye, and we'd always clash due to our creative differences. So now, a year later, I started the brand back up again under a new, altered name, BUNYC (be unique, but with a NYC focus) 

I released a few logo bracelets made out of wood, made in china, which I thought would sell tremendously, considering when I had released logo chains in the past, they sold out right away. 

But they didn't. I still have a shit ton of stock left over. I've done the whole facebook ads thing, have an instagram, twitter, facebook page, you name it. I even have an Etsy store which is my current storefront at the moment because I don't really have much web designing skills anymore. 

This company has never gained any profit, mainly due to having a lazy partner who never saw things my way, and stuff never getting done. I run the company by myself now. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/SntYDhY.jpg) these are my logo bracelets.

To explain the logo a bit, the hand gesture spells a U in sign language while the palm is a B. Hence, saying ""B-U"".

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/N94f47k.jpg) this is another shirt which I had released in the past.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ztm7Dc6.jpg) and this. 

There are plenty of others but I assume you get the point. 

Marketing has always been a major issue, as is with any start up company these days. I can't even raise capital at this point in the game.

Even with this, I'm starting up a sub brand under BUNYC. 

My goal is to turn BUNYC into a cloud showcasing other brands, ala a boutique. 

My second brand, ""Finesee &amp;amp;amp; Felice"" is more of a high fashion brand. For example:

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/XIIYvK5.jpg)

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/xfOEOcX.jpg)

This is just one shirt I designed.

I live in Staten Island, NY. A ferry ride away from NYC. 

I may have left out a bunch of details, so feel free to fire away and ask me anything. I need as much criticism, and helpful advice as possible.

EDIT: To speak a little more on my sub brand, ""Finesse &amp;amp;amp; Felice"", it's mainly a high fashion brand which is affordable. It's targeted to those people who are going out on weekends and shop at places such as Express, Armani and etc to get an outfit for the evening. Instead of always spending nearly $60 or more on a dress shirt, they can get quality clothing from my brand that looks good, and unique.

When I first started there he say you can spend up to $20 at day to make a customer happy.'
What he meant was that I could, without asking his permission, give any number of customers something free up to what equaled $20 every single day. 
'Oh I forgot stamps' here you go.
'Oh I forgot this photocopy' no problem.
The goodwill that those small (less than $20) gestures show far out weights any 'costs' in actual lost income.
It seems like small and obvious advice but I have carried that little bit of customer service on with me ever since and thought I would share.

I've always dreamt about working for myself. Something about flexibility and working in my underwear, I'm not sure :) Besides, I don't really care for benefits (not right now anyway) and the pay is potentially nicer.


Anyway, I was employed by a design firm, whose clients range local to nationwide (now international—Canada), where I had the pleasure of working closely with local and State Gov clients alike. It was fun and the experience was invaluable. But the available work was dwindling down..


A month and a half ago I was let go. Despite the lack of work, I was surprised as I was the only experienced UI guy in the building. I brushed off the poor decisions of the (then) manager and knew that this is the perfect time to sieze the opportunity to chase my dream of becoming a freelance designer.


I went to work immediately. Within the past month and a half, I created the concept, wireframes, tested, wrote copy, designed, rewrote the copy, tested some more, coded, optimized, and on top of that managed to build and launch another website during that project cycle. I was working overtime for my self. I loved it.


Yesterday, I am proud to say that I finally launched the site for my creative services:

http://hire.vg


I should also mention that I've been a redditor for a few years, but wanted to make an account that isn't tied to my personal posts.


I'm happy to have my story be the first post on this awesome subreddit.

Like many of the posters in this subreddit, it has always been a dream to start and run my own business. In high school/college I ran a web design company with a friend... which was nice, not having to have a regular job in college. After planning for the past 2 years, writing my business plan, and rewriting it hundreds of times (which I need to update again this week), took the advice of many, and ignored the advice of some. 


We are [Oval Brewing Company](http://ovalbrewing.com), named after the central green space on Ohio State's campus (where the 2 of us were roommates). We are planning a production brewery with a tasting room in Columbus Ohio. Like most of the Midwest (and country for that matter) the craft beer market is exploding in Columbus, it was 9th largest growth market for craft beer last year, yet only has a handful of breweries with very little output.

I started my obsession with beer when I started homebrewing 2 years ago. From the beginning I started researching what it would take to start a brewery... which is not easy, very expensive, and very time consuming. That didn't deter me, I have been educating myself on all aspects I can from the business side to the brewing side. I have partnered with a friend of mine who is an extremely talented graphic designer and have been building our branding as we work towards building the rest of the business. I am taking classes on the technical aspects of brewing from the Siebel Institute, which is one of the top brewing schools in the world.

We started a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ovalbrewing/the-oval-brewing-company-the-best-damn-beer-in-the) at the beginning of February, that ends March 31.  The campaign is going great so far, we have 3 weeks left and are 74% funded. The goal is a small part of what we need, and have some traditional investors as well... but we have gotten some great exposure because of the campaign, and it will help us with a lot of the up front costs during the first few months.

If any of you are interested in backing, we put together a special Reddit reward. 

http://vimeo.com/37571657

[This page](http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/) goes into more detail, with an explainer video.

One of the cool things about Kickstarter is it can track where backers originate from… and we thought it would be a great idea to keep track of and thank Reddit backers in a special way. If the total pledges originating from Reddit are $10,000 or over, we will brew and can a beer created by Reddit! You will still get the awesome rewards as non-redditor backers, but you will get the opportunity to help crowd-source one of our first beers. You will get to vote on the label design, style, strength, and name! And regardless of your pledge level, your Reddit username will be displayed on the can*!

You send me an e-mail with details about whatever, or whoever, and I write the tune. I wrote 175 songs last year for other people, and I'm coming close to 100 or so already this year. I've done songs for birthdays, anniversaries, sympathy, funny songs, all sorts of stuff. I even wrote an album of songs based on comments from Reddit users.

www.songsforreddit.bandcamp.com

The music and the lyrics are all from scratch/made to order. I don't use templates or pre-existing material. (I've started to accidentally repeat parts of melodies and progressions and stuff, but I guess that's to be expected at least a little.) 

I can write and record 5-6 tunes a day (2-3 if I'm doing a full production) and with my current living situation, if I can pull in 1-2 orders a day consistently, I can charge right around $100 for each song, and live very comfortably. (an incredible value in my opinion and the opinion of my clients!) 

I have a website, but it's not really helping. I feel like there is something I'm missing. This could be a really cool service that a lot of people could take advantage of. Anyone have any ideas on how I can turn this ""skill"" into a sustainable entity? I feel like if ""Sure_Ill_Draw_That"" can support himself with a traffic'd website, personalized songs should be able to do something similar? Or am I way off base?

Advice, suggestions, comments and reality checks, all welcome!

I am David, just turned 23, and have been an aspiring entrepreneur since high school.  My internship and subsequent full-time work in a small-business environment have confirmed what I knew all along - I can do this!

The problem is, I have no idea where to start.  I am poking around the reddit page here but it seems everyone either has capital or has a loan.  I would like some advice on how someone as young and (relatively) inexperienced as myself can take the plunge and not instantly sink.

My idea involves integrating web development with database management, helping small/medium businesses drastically improve organizational efficiency by getting data in the cloud.  Basically, bringing companies to Web 2.0 (where online content is added/edited/removed primarily through DBMS rather than hard-editing HTML).  My degree is in Computer Information Systems, and I am in Charlotte, NC.  You will find most major web development firms here focus on design, development, SEO, and online marketing and are not helping businesses get in the cloud.

If anyone has any advice for me at all, please let me know.  I am at a point in my life where I know that this (cloud integration and web development) is what I want to do.  I would just a whole lot rather do it for myself than someone else.

I just launched my first startup yesterday called [Chatalyst](http://chatalyst.co).

**What I'm doing:** Chatalyst gives you the functionality of Omegle/Chatroulette by matching you up with other users to chat with but goes one step further. We allow users to save each other to private message later, incentivize them to treat each other well with a reputation system that rewards users for good conversation, and offer a forum for users to share their experiences with others.

The eventual goal is to monetize users by using the main site as a conversion funnel to a subscription based dating site with similar functionality. I'll probably have ads and some purchasable add-ons as well.

**How it was done**
Chatalyst was built in 3 months time with no funding other than my own savings. I did all the development work myself which I had to learn as I went. I had a designer friend craft the logo for me. Chatalyst was pretty extensively user tested and QA'ed prior to launch which I'm pretty thankful for since the market I'm targeting (18-26, bored, looking for novelty and new people to interact with) wasn't something I knew much about in the beginning.

**What I would have done better**

* I should have thought about press and presence months in advance. I originally spent 100% of my time on building the site, which was a very productive time, but I spent very little time thinking about customer acquisition. I was comforted by the fact that competitors in my space didn't really know what they were doing in this area either and figured things would work themselves out.

* I should have had a splash page to capture user signups/emails months before the site went live. The idea came way too late, and the splash page went up a week before launch. Instead of capturing a few hundred users over that period of time, I signed up 40.

* I should have user tested consistently throughout the development process. Since I was confident in the assumptions I made off some early testing prior to development, I didn't user test again until the product was built. This was a mistake as I got some really good insight that would have changed the way I built Chatalyst.

1366463846.0,38,self.Entrepreneur,1cqmgm,My experience with Doba after 48 hours.,schnit,51,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1cqmgm/my_experience_with_doba_after_48_hours/,"So it was suggested of me in a previous thread to try and use Doba as a dropshipping service.  It was said the margins aren't great, but that it's still a good service.   They have a free 1 week trial, and like the free credit report sites you need to call them up and cancel before it's over if you don't like it.

For those who aren't familiar, doba is a paid subscription site ($60/month) with a huge catalog they claim is + 1 million individual items.

Here's what I found.

There are a LOT of items, unfortunately their catalog/search feature is absolutely terrible.  If I type in ""Canon"" under the search I'm presented with what initially appears to be 2 pages of products (24 on each page).  When I click to page 2, suddenly page 3 appears.  Clicking page 3 suddenly makes page 4 appear and this goes on and on and on.  One thing I noticed is that the further you go, the more times products are repeated to make the catalog appear bigger.

Another thing Doba is chalked full of is books.  Anytime you search for any widget, hundreds or thousands of books become displayed.   There is no way (that I see) to filter out just books.  You must go into a specific sub category like ""Home Garden &amp; Living"".  The problem is that there may be 30 sub categories you want to look at because who knows what you might find.

On top of it, a large percentage of items under any category are ""junk"" trinkets with brands nobody has ever heard of.

If you do manage to find an item which appears to be priced well, you click on it and typically see a ""dropship fee"" and what is typically an outrageous shipping fee.   Widget A - Initial price $19.99.  Click on it and see it has a $3 dropship fee and a $10 shipping estimate (it probably fits in an envelope).   Check e-bay/amazon and you see Widget A selling for $36.00 shipped.  Hell, you are lucky to find it making a potential profit because many times you find it online selling regularly for much cheaper.

Yesterday I received a phone call from Doba, guy welcomed me and said he was my personal sales agent to help me with any questions.  I informed him I was frustrated because the profit margins were very very slim.   I was hoping he would tell me I was doing something wrong, or there was a way to improve my searches.  Unfortunately he had no suggestions and sounded like he's heard the same thing from hundreds of other people.

In summary.  Yes, there is *some* money to be made off doba.com, I have found a few niche markets where there's a $5-10 profit after all fees on a $30-40 item.  The problem is that it takes a long time to find these and they aren't selling daily on the other sites.  You then need to find more pictures of the product (doba includes 1 photo, typically not very good quality), and write a good description.   Just to recoup the $60 monthly fee will likely take more than a few hours of work...Especially if you are only making $1-3 profit off each item.

If you just want to list a bunch of stuff, and have a huge store full of random garbage Doba might work well for you.   If you want to work smart, have a reputable product line and maximize your income:effort ratio I would strongly suggest you don't even bother.

Even though we earn about $2500 each plus some ""bonuses"", we usually have more month at the end of the bills.

I think the problem really is that we treat our company's income as our paycheck. I recently have thought about creating a system where we set a monthly ""paycheck"" for us (say $400/week) and leave the rest in the company's account.

The other problem is that we work with a finance company. If they determine that the customer's credit can be financed then we get paid for that sale (they pay 100% of the sales price, so the profit is immediate). If not, the finance company will service (send bills to the customer) for us for a monthly fee (this cuts into our profits since it takes about 6 months in order for us to get back from the customer our initial investment in the merchandise).

I think a lot of you spend too much time watching cnbc and reading forbes and tech businss news websites.

[this commenter:](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/yq93i/flipping_businessesbasic_concept_behind_flipping/c5xw9y5)

&gt;It's an interesting idea. I suspect there are a large number of small businesses that could be massively improved via modern systems and processes.
That said, it will likely be really capital intensive. Do you have access to millions of dollars?

It's thinking like this that keeps people from going out on their own.

Check out that www.loopnet.com and see how many business right down the street from you are selling at 2-6 times NOI.

You don't need millions of dollars to make millions of dollars.

After graduating three years ago with a degree in digital video and cinema studies I obtained a job as a video producer for a marketing company. After twelve months my company was purchased and I got a pink slip. I freelanced my video work for 3 months and made a good bit of money. I loved the freedom and the pay wasn't half bad. Fast forward and I landed a job (I don't know why I stopped freelancing in the first place) at one of the greatest companies in the US. It didn't pay a lot but I thought I'd love it forever. Six months in I realized it wasn't where I should be. Today I am proud to say I handed in my two weeks notice and will be freelancing full-time.

How can I secure my financial future now that I've taken the huge leap? How can I make money online and what are some good tips for doing so?

Recently our uni's student entrepreneur organization brought in a guest speaker with a history of successful business startups. Most of his advice was money/bus/marketing related, and quickly shifted into giving direct advice to business majors about their studies (so as an engineer it was hard to ask questions). He mentioned a few times that business people like him rely on ""idea guys"" like me to keep them from sitting around a table waiting for someone to come up with something. The problem is that I'm not sure what I need to contribute beyond the initial product idea, or how to work with them effectively in general. Unfortunately he rushed out to to meet grad students (the business school discussions lasted a while) before I could ask.

So if you're the ""business"" guy, and I just come up with solutions or other means of doing things then what do you need from me? How do I help you to help me and vice versa? How do I do my part to make the team work?

I've been struggling with this in our company.

Feedback good or bad would be amazing. Looking to know what we are doing right as well as wrong.    



Our old site was put together by a ""web guy"" with a good reputation and an amazing portfolio. He set up the shopping cart system and ""designed"" the frame of the website for us to go in and place all the products on our own. We ended up paying him $6,000. The site was extremely difficult to work with and any edits to the front page had to be done by the ""web guy"".    

We hated waiting for him to update the site and it costs money every time we needed something changed or added. We decided to leave him and redo the site with Shopify. It is by far the smartest decision we have made as a business so far. If you are looking for a simple eCommerce solution that offers great support I would highly recommend Shopify.    
- Shopify template = $150    
- Shopify Monthly Plan = $59    

If you know how to use a site like facebook or have edited a myspace profile, you should have no problem setting up a shopify.    

We later found out that Magento was free and our ""web guy"" just purchased a template. Costs for him was probably around $300 and he turned around and charged us $6,000.

My wife and I run a photobooth company. I designed and programmed the machine we use.  Tonight was our 4th paid event, so we're still very new to the whole thing.

Everything had been going well for the first 45 minutes.  People were taking photos and having fun and all of a sudden the machine just stopped working.  I get my laptop out to start diagnosing the problem and, long story short, turns out my [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) has completely died.  (Sidenote: Arduinos are a very cool, programmable microcontroller.)  The Arduino is the core of my machine;  It controls the Easy Button presses and triggers the camera shutter, without it I'm dead in the water.  

My stress level shoots through the roof.  The bride has paid for a 3 hour session and I have 30 people standing in line waiting to take photos.  What the hell am I going to do?

The DJ saw me struggling and came over to offer help.  He asks if I have any spare parts, which I didn't.  But that reminded me that Radio Shack just started selling Arduinos in their stores.  The DJ, the bad ass that he is, said me he'd take care of the crowd while I headed to the mall for a new Arduino.  He announced that dinner was ready and the photobooth would resume operation afterwards.

I managed to get to Radio Shack 10 minutes before they closed.  I sped back to the reception and configured the new Arduino.  Plugged it in, crossed my fingers and powered the machine back up.

It worked flawlessly.

I don't think I've ever been so relieved in my life.  People came back over and started taking pictures again.  Nobody was even aware that the whole thing had just blown up on me.

A friend and myself live in a highly populated suburb in the U.K. There is a crazy amount of dirty takeaways on the main street however it is extremely hard to get a good burger after 4 PM. We are just finishing university so we are strapped for cash. 

**Our Idea**

Create a burger company that delivers a high quality/gourmet burger to your door within 45 mins with fries for five pound.

* We will be doing this from home.

* There are two of us.

* Open from 4/5-12ish

* Prep everything before opening

* If it works and we start making money apply for grants and open a shop.

* Prices will increase to cover additional overheads of opening a shop.

We are having problems figuring out what certificates or licenses we may need to begin trading. We'd also like to hear of any ideas or setbacks you can think of that we may encounter. We hope to post our progress through this month as we are hoping to have our first opening on the 7th of June.

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback so far guys!! A number of people have commented on the bun going soggy and the burger losing heat through transit. I'm actually going to test now how effective it is at keeping heat by wrapping it in tin foil after cooking and letting it sit for twenty minutes.

Without giving out too many details it is an item of clothing with a unique design, specifically for girls/women who do water sports. So it is a niche but a pretty large one.

They have no distribution in the EU and through several conversations, offered me to become their distributer if I wanted. (They also have no distributor in the US but that's another story).

So here we are, I thought maybe r/Entrepreneur may be able to help me understand what's involved and whether it's likely to be worth it. A few questions:

1. Typically what would my responsibilities be and what would I have to do in the role of Distributer?
2. Could it potentially be fully automated? Effectively allowing me to position myself between the producer and an already established distributer.

sure, there may be disagreements -- but we could do something awesome. 

Surely, someone has a great product that we can sell. I know there are web-designers. I know that we have graphic designers. SEO is covered. Software is covered. And if it was a physical operation, we could build a brand nationally if everyone was on board.

Due to that level of support however, I'm buying more industrial equipment that should make everything faster. I adapted. 

Here are some tips from what I learned:

* Promote the project on reddit, specifically an appropriate subreddit (I used [/r/rpg](/r/rpg))
* **When Kickstarter makes a suggestion, listen**: They said the average reward is $25, so I had 3 different rewards at that level and they are by far the most popular making up 56% of funding and 64% of backers
* **Increase rewards to spur further donations**, but make it a goal: **move people to the next level up** (by moving from $15 to $25, backers would get into the 'bonus' and get 3 sets rather than 1, for less than the original reward level)
* **Not all rewards have to cost you** (I gave away a copy of my book to backers, but you could include a handwritten thank you card). Make backers feel special!
* **Make the story personal.** They are not only backing an interesting project, but also backing the person behind it. CONNECT WITH THEM and with the story of WHY.
* Search twitter, G+, and the web for mentions of the project and **interact with backers**, even with a simple Thank You or +1. It will encourage them to continue to share and let them feel connected again to the individual, not the project
* **Don't be greedy.** Decide what your project needs and set that as your goal. You can also find good uses of more money, but with less you won't succeed.
* **Remember fees and shipping!** When you set your rewards, remember that 8-10% will go to fees, and ~$5 (~$10 international) will go to shipping. Consider this when you set your reward amount!

Am I getting played? How can I persuade these factories to choose air shipping? I don't want to burn $50 on shipping to product test material that could end up being crap.

A few things to clear stuff up...

* I have 4 machines that produce 3 sizes (1"", 1.25"", 2.25""). And yes, they are the by-hand machines, however anybody can knock out 200-250 buttons per hour after getting the hang of it.
* I have a single supplier in America that makes the raw materials, but I do all the production (printing art, cutting, producing pins) in-house at my apartment. No overhead!
* You can DEFINITELY operate this remotely. My local customers will surely pay a few bucks for shipping since they also won't have to pay local sales tax (8%) if you live out of town. Or free shipping can be used as a bargaining chip for larger orders. 
* Yes, by a typical definition I've definitely UNDER-valued the business. I'm pricing it based off the inventory/equipment alone. All other intangibles like profit trends / customers / relationships / websites / IP are totally free. I just want to help someone out. :)
* I print art @ 300dpi on a high-end (but not commercial) laser printer. I'm not including mine in this sale but can recommend the exact model for ~$350

Hey entrepreneurs!

For the past year I've been running a small company, [Mylar Designs](http://mylardesigns.com). 

We make pin-back buttons along with magnets, keychains, etc, for brands and organizations. We also do some graphic design (outsourced to a couple trustworthy people). About 90% of our work, however, is just the pin-back buttons.

Buttons are super popular these days... they are used everywhere from political campaigns to even JC Penny's newest shopping scheme. They fall in the ""non-traditional marketing collateral"" category. I've done orders for customers like Nordstrom, Tupperware, and local college sports teams.

**Quick nuts/bolts**

* 100+ customers
* 20+ active customers (recurring orders)
* ~5 leads weekly, 60% conversion (extremely high)

I haven't put forth a single marketing effort in 6 months because word of mouth for this service is phenomenal. When I used to 'try,' I got a LOT more business and you could too.

**More nuts/bolts**

* 73% profit margin
* $300-1,500 /monthly profit (pending effort)

Anybody interested in an easy side business? I'm looking to get $2,000, which just about covers the equipment. All customers / relationships / spreadsheets / stationary / etc are pro bono.

Feel free to PM any questions!

1350482264.0,36,self.Entrepreneur,11mo93,I launched my start up a month ago but things are slow. I’m looking for advice.,moscadesnuda,44,8,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/11mo93/i_launched_my_start_up_a_month_ago_but_things_are/,"Hello entrepreneurs, I am Felipe, the creator of *La Ville Nue* (The Naked City, in french).    
This is my [webpage](http://www.lavillenue.fr). We are a small startup located in Lyon, France that makes city maps targeted at foreigners and/or newcomers to the city. 


This all started 3 years ago when I arrived from Chile to Lyon and didn’t know where to go or what to do? Where to find places that were truly genuine and not tourist traps. So my partner and I decided to make a map (first in print and later [web/phone app](http://www.lavillenue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/phone-app.jpg)) that could show these places. 


This is the result. We’ve made a beautiful (if I may say so about my own creation) [map that shows bars, bookstores, cinemas, theaters, music and strange curiosities of Lyon](http://www.lavillenue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/plie002.jpg). 
We’ve been inspired by [Situationist maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International) where we don’t show everything in the city, just the places we think are relevant to the persons looking for something to do. 


We believe this concept can take off, and we’d like to have our map in other cities once our brand makes a name of itself. 


As for the business part of all this; we’re [selling our maps](http://www.lavillenue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-04-16.52.05.jpg) in several stores throughout Lyon right now, and we have a couple of meetings with people from the tourist office this and next week. But those meeting have never ended very well for us.     
We also try to participate as much as we can in student reunions- this night for example we’re going to a polyglot club (language club) with around 70 people and we’ll have a stand in a corner showing off our maps. 


We have a facebook page and blog in which we post (not very often I should admit) but that has given us some traffic and we’ve got around 70 likes on our page. I’m not sure if that a lot or not, but it seems low to me.


The launch week, we sold a few maps through our [webpage](http://www.lavillenue.fr) and in person to friends, but we feel that it hasn’t really taken off the way we would’ve liked it to.     
At this moment we’re planning to make a video to market the brand a bit and post it on facebook. We had a [good experience with videos on facebook before](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=393440587359447), with high “[viral](http://i.imgur.com/wYKYW.png)” sharing compared to photos or text.

Have a haunted house where individuals go in one at a time, (about 5 min intervals).

Once in the room, a rubber dummy on wheels with it's head made of a laxex zombie mask on a watermelon, ""attacks"" the participant and they have to kill it by smashing its deliciously refreshing head in. The carnage is filmed for later purchase. A cleanup crew squeegees the mess up and glues the mask on a new watermelon and sets it up for the next guy. Admission would be about 29.99. Have at it.

I'm sure many of you know right where I am at. Past efforts have brought both epic failure and a few reasonable successes. This time though things are very different and I wanted to share the things that REALLY mattered (to me) when starting a business:

* **Find/Build A Team You Can Trust**- This has been one of the hardest things for me to accomplish as an entrepreneur. Finding people that have true drive, good communication and that you can rely on take a long time to find. Solid communication is KEY. ALSO- people say ""don't go into business with your friends"" I dont agree with that. I think if there is nothing wrong with it as long as you have a solid contract.

* **There is NOTHING more important that Passion and Persistence** - Doing what you love both pushes you through the tough times and improves the quality of your (business) life like nothing else. If you don't love it you will either fail, be unsatisfied or both. 

* **ASK And Ye Shall Receive** - Perhaps the most recent lesson learned is once you know what you want don't be afraid to ASK. Ask for help, ask for funding, ask for advice, ask for things you don't think are possible.

* **Aim Higher** - One thing past successes have taught me is to aim higher. I'm sure you have been there- you set a goal, achieve it, look back and realize ""shit... that was easy."" Success is a little bittersweet to me because it always makes me wonder how much more I could have accomplished if I would have set a higher goal.

I know a lot of this is common sense, but I also think it helps to hear things over again. Would you add/change anything?

I have been pouring every ounce of my energy and nearly every second of free time since March into the biggest business venture I have ever embarked on.

On the fence between using Magento and Shopify.,PokerInTheBrain,37,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1cc4z9/starting_up_my_first_ecommerce_site_on_the_fence/,"I have looked at both sites and asked around on what platform would be most beneficial for someone new to Ecommerce who has little to no experience in this area.

I have spent the past month doing extensive research into a niche market and have finally selected what I want to focus on. I have contacted suppliers and got all the information I need (basically all of the off web stuff is going smoothly). The only thing that I dont have is experience in website management / design.

Numerous sources have said I should use Shopify. I have heard it is much easier to use and there is no need to worry about servers and code customisation. There is also no additional costs for hosting on Shopify and you can get your domain name through them as well. With regards to Magento on this, I am not sure if it is the same or different.
Plans I'm looking at are similar in price, (£38-£39) with 1% transaction fee on Shopify and 0% on Magento. You get more SKUs on Shopify however this is quite irrelevant as they are both quite large. Storage is also larger on the Shopfiy plan.

So basically I am a website ""Noob"" who is looking for any information at all on comparison between these two platforms. Are there any readers who did not know much about web design but were successful is designing one? One question I do have though is whether or not I am able to select a Theme on Magento and then incorporate it onto Shopify's platform? I ask this because I think there is not many decent themes in the Shopify store for what I want to sell and I am willing to pay a little more for a decent design.

Sorry if all these questions are very basic but everyone has got to start learning somewhere. Later on once I get my website up and running I will be looking for SEO and website design consultation but I will cross that bridge when I come to it.

Unfortunately, I think they are under the impression I have a fisherman who is setting out to catch/kill these fish in particular. Which isn't the case. The only reason Marlin is available is because it's a by-catch of other fish the commercial boats are after.

So, it's more purchasing a product that is a by product of something else. These fish are taken in regardless because the boats don't have the capabilities of 'releasing them' like a non-commercial boat does. 

Obviously, people have their own opinions on this. Just as I'm sure people don't think I should sell chicken, or beef, or pork (although that's what business I'm in). This product is very cheap and we see mostly lower-income customers purchasing it. So, I would have to tell regular customers with families that they now have to buy a more expensive fish.

Aside from personal beliefs, what would you do as a business owner in this situation? 

A lot of the people in this association are customers, and I don't want to piss them off on an issue they care about. But, I can't help but think that I'm being strong-armed and it's hard to have someone tell you what items you should/shouldn't sell.

Any direction about how to validate one of these would be appreciated.",campreneur,47,10,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1icryr/okay_so_i_am_an_acknowledged_wantrepreneur_i_have/,"As the title states, I get ideas for business opportunities, but do not have a business background to validate the ideas. One thing I have learned from /r/Entrepreneur is that ideas are meaningless without execution, and my ideas are most likely not going to be stolen just by talking about them. 

So here are some ideas:

1. In my current line of work, we manufacture a product that many other companies manufacture--lets say a musical instrument. This musical instrument uses a plastic part that comes to us (and I believe every other manufacturer) in a very raw shape that we then have to spend a considerable amount of time fine tuning to be ready to use. It also comes in strips that are just long enough for one product. I am new to this industry, and the first thing I asked was why are we spending all of this time doing non-value added work to prepare the part before it can be assembled. And why do we buy it in single strips instead of on large rolls? 

  Idea: Get specs for the part, find a manufacturer and offer rolls of prepared pieces that the instrument manufacturer just has to cut to length. 

2. In my previous job, I was sent to several multi-day industry conventions. I met many people who ran out of business cards. 

  Idea:Set up a booth at conventions where you can print cards on demand. Eventually have an app that allows the user to scan or upload their card so it is printed exactly as the original. 

3. I love to camp with a hammock and have come up with a simple way to sling a tarp over the hammock without having to tie it to stakes in the ground--allowing for easier setup, rocking w/o hitting the tarp, etc.

4. Related to the above, but targeted at international travelers--a towel/hammock/beach blanket all in one.

5. For car camping, I have designed and built a basic shade structure that attaches to vehicle roof racks. I have seen one other product of this type, but it is &gt;$400. I think I could cut that price in half by making the product a lot simpler than the other that I have found on the market.

How do I validate one or more of these ideas and potentially make them real?

I built this site on a whim I had while on vacation for the holidays. Ever find good porn but can't *get* to it right away? What about stuff you really enjoyed, where do you save it? If you're like me, you don't want naughty stuff in your browsing history and especially not in your bookmarks. So I built **[http://xstashed.com/](http://xstashed.com/accounts/register/)** - a place to stash your nsfw gems.

While it's a minimal viable product, I do have a basic road map that can be viewed here http://xstashed.com/todo/. As you can see a bookmarklet is on my todo list. I'll likely get to that tomorrow. (I tend to get distracted while testing if you know what I mean.) Along with that there will be a simple API that will be open for 3rd parties. I just wanted to get this in the hands of potential users to get feedback early on.

On the tech side of things i've built this thing nimble so that I can quickly shape the site from your feedback. For those who are interested  xstashed is a custom Django (Python) application continuously deployed with Chef. MySQL for database, Celery for background task, and Redis for cache and Celery broker.

Register, try it out, use it, try to break it, show your friends, and leave feedback here.


Thanks!

Edit:

I appreciate all of the feedback from Reddit, and wanted to provide you with an update. In an effort to keep the service anonymous, email is no longer required to sign-up. I've also created a basic bookmarklet that you can find in the sidebar. Anything added from your bookmarklet will go into your ""New"" stash. Retention hasn't been great so i'm hoping the bookmarklet will vastly improve the whole experience by making it easier to utilize the service.

I've been in a struggling business for nearly 8 years. For the longest time, i've always thought it was a matter of perseverance and persistence. But in the last few weeks i've come to realise that the crux of the problem was the issues between myself and my business partner. We just seem to have differing core values and differing approach to things and ultimately, i feel like the personality compatibility/conflict issues get too much in the way.

So today, i've decided to call it quits and go it alone.

I'm behind on my commitments to my wife, to my family, to my friend. I told them that success was just around the corner, but it never materialised.

update: Truly overwhelmed by the response. I'm really grateful to you all for the encouraging words.
I have some legal trouble to deal with but want to make my exit from the business as smooth and quick as possible.

Thank you to all that responded. I will definitely be bookmarking this thread and re-visiting it when i need a reminder of why i set out to do this.



I've given a lot of business advice to others, but now feel like an idiot for doing so.

I'm feeling very much like a failure right now, and some words of encouragement would be really helpful.

I came across it in this [*New Yorker article*](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/18/100118fa_fact_gladwell) by Malcom Gladwell. 

A few of my favorite quotes from the book:

**On vision...**
""The entrepreneur is often presented as a visionary, bearing from the outset the idea, the plan, the strategy that will lead to his success.  Our careful study of career biographies suggests rather a process of improvement through trial and error, depending on opportunities, a sequence of improvised adaptations gradually assembled into a coherent course of conduct: the celebrated ""strategy"" was often only the rationalization after the fact of the conditions of success.""  Cites Sam Walton and Ingvar Kamprad as examples.

**On innovation...**
""It is often said that success in business is the reward for those who have been able to innovate, so much so that the cult of innovation became the industrial religion of the late twentieth century, celebrated in all the business schools and encouraged by government authorities.  However, when we consider closely the careers of the thirty-two businessmen in our sample, it becomes clear that innovation is not chronologically the first cause of their success.  Innovation is an expensive and risky process that is difficult to protect and takes a long time to produce profits; it requires first of all the means to pay for it and control it.  We propose to consider innovation as a means of consolidating and ensuring the duration of wealth, which, unless it is inherited, first has to be acquired by other means, in particular by what might be provocatively called ""predation""."" Cites LVHM as example--owner of Dior, Hennesey, Louis Vutton, Bvlgari, etc.

**On risk-taking...**
""In fact, businessmen in our sample often outlasted their competitors because they were able to arrange localized and temporary procedures that made them less exposed to than their competitors to the vagaries of the marketplace.""  Cites AXA as example.  

**Info about their sample set of 32 entrepreneurs who increased their wealth by a factor of 100 within 20 years**

    - 56% of the businessmen came from families that were among the 10% of the most wealthy in the country in which they were raised.
    - 62% are Europeans, 38% are North American
    - 91% enjoyed favorable conditions for the financing of their first companies, with a contribution from parents or in-laws in 53% of the cases, and friends or relations in 44% of the cases.
    - 72% had parents in an independent, non-salaried profession
    - 56% already knew their future customers or suppliers before going into business for themselves
    - 72% indicate that obtaining or holding onto exclusive information was a decisive factor at some stages of their career
    - 69% have made threats in the course of negotiations, directed towards employees (22%) or customers, suppliers, competitors (34%)
    - 63% indicate that at some point in his career, the businessman skillfully and opportunely shifted risks to others: associates, employees, government, customers, or suppliers
    - 22% -- invented their own technical innovations
    - 44% -- the innovation came from a close associate
    - 22% -- the innovation was stolen
    - 22% -- the innovation was acquired in advantageous conditions (weak negotiating position)

I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to launch our product using kickstarter. It looks like my company is going to raise some angel funding, so we don't really need the money. Also, the product itself is for an older age range who don't go on kickstarter (but their friends/family would).   

However, we do need PR, and I'm trying to see if kickstarter would be useful for that. Any thoughts would be great!  Here are my own pros/cons after talking to people who have done kickstarters:

pros:   

* Media exposure, traffic (potentially)
* Could treat as promo (discount pricing), have limited units, sell out.
* Can take donations


risks:   

* We look like we're bootstrapping...as opposed to saying we have a polished, funded product.
* May miss our goal, negative PR
* If people know we're funded they won't want to participate?
* people say backers are ""needy and entitled"", but I think this goes for any pre-ordering. People freak if product is delayed.

Hello again chaps, thanks to all the people who helped me out after I posted the last time. The first episode is ready for you guys to listen to here: http://www.entrepreneurpodcast.co.uk

Thanks to Tyler King, CEO of Less Annoying CRM for being the first guest on the show, he's a really nice guy and the interview was easy to do and he came across really well.

Now, I'm aware that there is a lot to improve for future episodes, there is definitely a couple of sections that could do with some more polish. I tried not to talk too much due to the fact that I assume listeners want to hear and learn from successful entrepreneurs and not hear my voice too much.

But one of my favorite methods of getting new business has been to attend local networking events and, when possible, present at them.

I'm somewhat introverted so the thought of talking with 50+ random strangers in a room scared me a bit at first, but I've really grown to love it. And it's by far our most effective method of getting new business since we're targeting a non-technical group of people.

I've walked out of the room with multiple cheques in hand from just having a couple minute conversation with people. But most of the time I just leave with A LOT of leads. People get to know me and I get to briefly tell them about what I do and they usually know a few people who could use what we offer and start handing me names + phone numbers.

1344133313.0,33,self.Entrepreneur,xp4b2,"I started a small business nearly by accident, and I couldn't think of a better place to document the experience.",Gawd129,48,15,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/xp4b2/i_started_a_small_business_nearly_by_accident_and/,"Hey fellow /r/entrepenuers.  Beyond documenting my experience, I'd like to put my business on display here in order to absorb the experience and wisdom of my compatriots.  Sorry this is totally super long, but I'm using this as my own personal documentation of this adventure as well.  TL;DR by request.  But first, a bit of my background.

I'm 23, have a 2 year degree from a community college. I was a pretty average student, as I was never the type to do the homework.  Luckily, since my hobbies include politics, both local and national, science, business, and of course the internet and it's ceaseless debate over the oxford comma, I can at least get across that I'm well informed.  I work as a cell phone salesman for a major company.  I wasn't getting enough hours, and after many forgotten promises from my boss, I realized I was going to have to find a source of income elsewhere.  

I put an ad up on craigslist (link by request) advertising myself and my friends as local ""under employed 20 somethings ready to work for you.""  The response was surprising.  Within a couple days I had more job requests than myself and my one friend who was in on it could handle.  I accepted all the jobs I could and put up an ad on craigslist looking for people who could be movers.  The next morning I was hiring at a nearby starbucks before an afternoon moving job.  At the interviews I stressed the business model that I believe in: do an amazing job, let your clients know they're supporting real people instead of a corporation, and do an amazing job.  

I hired 3 guys that morning.  They were the first three I interviewed, a 31 year old, a 19 year old and an 18 year old.  I realize the problems with doing this.  But as I mentioned, I work 20 hours a week as a wage slave, and as I don't think I mentioned, another 20 hours a week as a volunteer for a local environmental conservation group.  I had to get at least three guys to a job site at a time when I was scheduled to work my day job.  I made it clear the all the interviewees that I have a lot going on and I'm going to rely on them to be kick ass.  They seemed to appreciate the trust.  I explained that I would be charging 12 an hour and paying them 10, but I wouldn't be making a profit on new customers.  With the profit margin from any first job for a client, I spend it on a gift for them.  Because of the time of year, we're getting a lot of moving gigs.  I bring moving clients a vase and flowers to welcome them to their new home.  I explained how the only way I make any money is if I'm either working along side them, or they are earning my repeat business.  I explained that the ones who worked the hardest and exuded the company values the most would get a higher number of higher quality jobs.  My feeling so far has been that the more honest I am about what I'm doing and why my values are important to me, the more they care about the mission and want to do their best for me.  I've worked in management before, but never in this way.  So far, I'm a fan.

I pulled a favor with a co worker at my cell phone sales job to let me escape for an hour off the record.  I made it to the job site right as the client was scheduled to arrive.  She was late.  I took the opportunity to hand out a welcome letter I had written between the interviews and my day job.  It went over most of the basics.  What we do, how we act, why we're the right choice for the customer and so on.  I blabbed on for a while until she arrived about 20 minutes after the scheduled time.  We sprang to attention and got started.  It was here that I made a mistake.  Being the one who had arranged the deal and set the expectations, the client was under the impression I would be doing the move along side my men.  When I explained that I would soon have to leave, she seemed distraught and I felt a negative feeling come over her.  Luckily I hadn't yet deployed the secret weapon.  I grabbed the bouquet and vase I'd gotten for her -about $18.00 after tax- and placed it on her kitchen counter near one of our fliers. I helped grab a few things out of the truck, and then ran to the store to grab some water and sun screen for the guys.  When I got back I helped unload at hyperspeed for about 30 minutes, talked to the client a bit about whether there was anything else I could get going for her to make her life easier.  She explained that she had more to move than she had anticipated and that she would need us again tomorrow.  I happily agreed.  When I left to get back to work, she now seemed understanding and at peace about my leaving.  I think I was able to communicate to her that I would be there if I could, but my life is crazy just like hers.  She seemed to sympathize. 
For reasons you'll realize are important in about one line, you should know this took place on a Wednesday.  I got back to work and kept a close eye on my phone.  Of the three guys I had, I knew one was unavailable on Thursdays.  I was down to two, and I wasn't able to reach one of them to confirm the second day's work.  I had 1 confirmed for what was at least a 3 man job, and I realized I would need to hire again.  The response for my ""Movers Needed 8/1"" was so dramatic I'd taken it down, but i'd sifted through the emails and voice mails and only scheduled interviews with those that weren't clearly incompetent.  I reposted the ad, changing only the date to 8/2.  By morning I had several emails and a couple of voice mails, even though I'd noted clearly in the ad that I wouldn't be taking calls before 9 am.  Using the responses as a rough filter, I scheduled two more interviews and hired two more guys, a 16 year old (maybe someone can help me with the issues regarding age?) and a 29 year old.  I confirmed them both for the job the same day and was ready to rock.
I worked my day job at 1:00 and the gig was at 3:00.  I pulled a different co worker aside and asked them to repay a favor.  I was going to need to leave twice today.  At 2:00 I got a call from the worker I was unable to touch base with the previous night or this morning.  He told me that he was at the site but the client wasn't.  ""No shit."" I told him.  The job wasn't until 3:00, and if he'd returned my calls he would have known that.  I lightly chastised him for not returning my calls, explained to him that now I'm over staffed and that it hurts all of us, and told him he would have to wait. 
I left work to join the crew at the gig at 2:50.  While I was on the way I received a call from the client telling me she was just now departing with the uhaul, a solid 50-60 minute drive away from the destination.  I picked up a couple of Little Ceasers ready made pizzas and headed to the job site, preparing to break some shitty news to the crew.  
I got to the site, set out the pizzas, introduced the new guys, went over a couple basics, and then broke the news.  After telling them she wasn't going to be on time, I broke down the situation.  I explained that it wouldn't be sustainable for me to pay for work that I'm not getting paid for, and that at the same time it's not fair to have them be here when they aren't getting paid.  I explained that on the ride over, the best idea I'd come up with to keep this from happening agian was to remember to confirm with clients the time we're starting, and make it clear the clock starts then.  I opened the floor to the guys, asking if they had any other ideas to make sure this was a one time occurrence.  No one suggested anything, but no one complained about the situation either.  I think they genuinely understood the dilemma and agreed I was doing all I could fairly do.
I got a hold of the client at 3:30, explaining that everyone was here and had been for a while, and that we have no problem waiting and was willing to eat the first half hour, but I would have to start billing her for this time.  She agreed.  I informed the guys that they were now on the clock, to enjoy the sun and I headed back to work.  I'd put my 19 year old with a great attitiude in the team lead position.  The team lead makes 11 an hour, while regular crew makes 10.  I mix up who's team lead with every job and give everyone a chance to perform.  I'll narrow down on the superstars as they prove themselves.  I always have the team lead text me when they think they're about 20-30 minutes from finished so I can try to get out there.  I pulled yet another favor and left work once I heard they were almost done.  I got there just in time to help finish taking the last few things out of the truck.  We finished up and the client asked me to help her get the uhaul back to the station.  I thought about how we should do it for a minute and asked her if she'd be willing to drop me off back at my work which happened to be right next to the uhaul place.  She agreed.  I paid the guys out of cash I'd picked up from an ATM earlier in the day.  I realized that my estimate was about 20 bucks off, and that because of the pizza I was short.  I politely and carefully asked the client if I could snag $20 of her bill right now to help pay the guys, and she promptly agreed. 
I got the guys all paid up, gave a quick pep talk, thanked them for their efforts and set them free.  I waited a minute for the client to be ready to take the truck back.  We left, me driving her van and her in the uhaul.  We got to the uhaul station, I moved over to the passenger seat and took the quick trip to my work.  We parked as she started to write out a check.  I calculated the hours, putting down only a single one for myself.  As she was writing out the check, she shared her concerns about the state of her garden, the condition of the house, and how she would have to call the Geek Squad to get her electronics set up.  I quickly assured her that those are all things I would be thrilled to help her with for way less than others would charge and with our level of customer service and she seemed relieved.

1338989570.0,30,self.Entrepreneur,unwjk,"Had my biggest learning experience, the hard way. What I learned from start to finish.",chromiselda,36,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/unwjk/had_my_biggest_learning_experience_the_hard_way/,"**Tl;dr:** Got scammed by a fraudulent printer on my first order; learned some important lessons on risk management, lawyered up and re-did it the right way.

The details: I run a lifestyle magazine, I've posted it here once or twice before - [link](http://www.nocigarmagazine.com). Basically it's an online magazine, but since we've got a bigger following, we've decided to go into printing. The costs are big, but the profits are bigger (better advertisement and of course revenue from sales).

**What I did at first:** Put together a list of what specifications we needed to print, and contacting 10-15 printers to get quotations. After talking with them for a while, I determined who would be cheap as well as be able to walk us through the steps for first time printing. One printer seemed particularly friendly and said they'd be happy to give us testers and help us make sure that our files are the quality they need. After haggling a little bit, these guys came down a lot in price and became the cheapest on the list too! They said we'd get an extra 10% discount if we paid up front, and cause cash flow is always a problem in small businesses, I said yes.

**What happened:** They never delivered, constant delays and so I called the job off (after apologizing to other people that we owed copies to) and asked for a refund. The refund still hasn't been paid, so I had to alert a bunch of authorities and read up on criminal law (fraud) and contract law cause I was pissed at this point.

**What I did wrong:** 

- Didn't check for any reviews of the printer

- Paid everything up front to a NEW supplier. (Seriously, how dumb was I?)

- Did not do any sort of credit check on them. Even something simple such as seeing their past history would have shown that they were a mere 6 months old, had never filed returns, and that their director had made his previous company insolvent!

- Happily went along without being suspicious of their cheap prices yet good service.


**Lessons learned, and implemented with the new supplier, who delivered goods today!**

- Do a credit check on them. Go to Companies House (or wherever their company was registered) and see that they're a legitimate business that files returns on time and pays taxes.

- Check for reviews. In fact the best way to do this is using keywords on google such as ""company name + fraud"" , ""company name + problems"" before seeing the good reviews.

- Agree to better payment terms! Never give everything up front unless you are an exceptionally small fish in the pond, and the company has a very reputed history. My new printer is in fact a listed company. I also double checked their reputation with my advertising agent (who gave it a big thumbs up) and another person whom I know in the business. Because of this and my size, I was okay to give them the payment up front this time. I also negotiated to deal partly in credit next time around, which they are happy to comply with.

My father is an entrepreneur by heart. After a successful pinball machine business he ran he is now giving a go at his other passion : travel. Our website has been made but not published online yet. How can we get some visibility to our website. SEO is going to be done but what are other ways to attract the 40 - 60 age group.

The business is a personalized travel agent, really. He used to be a travel agent and plans all of our friends/relatives trips. He has been to every hotspot multiple times and is a genius at it..so naturally he wants to try and make some dinero off of it. With pinballs, we didn't really have to advertise..it was a very niche product that attracted enough people through our website. We had a warehouse and showroom floor which we did a lot of our sales in.. plus eBay as the economy tanked in the early 2000's and pinballs weren't such a hot commodity any more.

I just graduated and don't have that much marketing knowledge..I suggested making some personalized youtube videos showcasing exactly what he is offering to do.

My website has been a side project for the last three months or so, spending a few hours a week on it. Finally got my first (very small) adsense payment today, it represents about 6 weeks of revenue.

Website is in the literature niche. It provides curated public-domain literature snippets with critical commentary.

My process for starting the site looked like this:

1) Niche research with the free version of Market Samurai. Looked around niches I was interested in, found a great search phrase with relatively low competition and 20k + exact local searches per month in USA. (I'm choosing not to link to the site here).

2) Bought an exact match domain for the keyphrase. This was a HUGE mistake, about four weeks after I started the site google released a minor update nerfing EMDs. Luckily I escaped the worst of it as I had some high quality links by then, but in retrospect having a brandable domain would be much, much better for linkbuilding / guest blogging

3) Designed the site (edited a free WP theme to do what I wanted it to do: minimal php and JS/html/css knowledge required).

4) Made the content: found all the primary content in old books and wrote all the analysis myself.

5) building links: 100% guest blogging. Approached high-authority blogs with personalized pitches. Scored some great links in exchange for well-tailored content

6) Did lots of A/B testing with ad copy, styling and placement. 

That's pretty much it. 

At the moment, the site gets about 20k-30k uniques per month. I'm hoping to grow more by getting some more links. 

Obviously I'm just starting out and my revenue is pretty pathetic, but it's a fairly passive income stream.

Can anyone help?,EdgeOfTheAbyss,38,8,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ob14w/my_business_is_four_weeks_away_from_imploding_can/,"I'm a semi-regular poster here, but very active in several other subreddits, so I'm reluctantly choosing to use a throwaway. It also pains me to post something like this here, but one of the important business lessons I've learned is that you can't be afraid to ask for anything.

I run a web development company. We don't make very many cookie-cutter blog or CMS-type sites, but rather focus on complex projects that require a lot of custom software development.  I don't outsource or offshore; my staff are all full-time, highly experienced college grads who are provided full benefits.  I've spent a lot of time recruiting these guys and we have a solid team. We do some pretty amazing work, but it doesn't come cheap.

The problem: Our largest client ran out of money to fund their project and I haven't been able to line up enough additional work fast enough.  So I'm presently burning through savings to keep the lights on.  With top talent comes a very costly payroll and I just can't do it for much longer. My fallback position is to lay off my entire staff and go back to outsourcing to freelancers.  However, this would severely impair my capabilities because a cohesive team is so much more efficient.  More importantly, I'm going to have to put some very good people out of work.

How you could help:

- Web-based software development work. As much as I'd like to take on any work available, honestly speaking, small projects would only delay the inevitable.  We're structured to take on $20k+ projects.  We regularly take on both work subcontracted from agencies and direct projects.

- I'd also be receptive to providing a sales commission or ""finders fee"" for any business that is referred my way.  This could be a pretty substantial commission considering the cost of most of our long term projects.

Admittedly,  I was skeptical that LinkedIn advertising would work . I've had pretty horrible results with any content advertising network (ads based on banners, not search engine PPC like Adwords) Facebook ads being the biggest money suck of all time. Tons and tons of clicks, but never a conversion... ever. I've pretty much given up on that sort of PPC bidding and focused solely on search engine PPC. However, I'm fairly impressed with the results of Linked in so far. Here is a screen shot of my conversion report: 

http://i.imgur.com/VGKJa.png 

What you're looking at here is a google analytic report of sales, sorted by conversion rate for the past two weeks. The top result is me running a test. Then my sales from organic search, then LinkedIn. Essentially, LinkedIn ads perform at a level that's only a couple of points lower than google organic search, but with a higher average per-visit value and a higher per-sale value. 

This campaign also has never been optimized. I made four ads, chose some targeting, set it at a low daily budget and let it run for two weeks. That means (theoretically speaking), I could optimize this campaign and set the budget much higher and it would perform better than any SEO I put into this site. 

Note that google Adwords is two steps below (number 6 on the report, which is cropped out, because I start to worry about giving away too much of my income sources publicly :-P). LinkedIn ads has a conversion rate of about double of Google Adwords. Even though google adwords brought in the bulk of the revenue the past two weeks, I'm also spending almost 20 times more with google than LinkedIn. That may change if these results stay consistent. 

I see people looking for ways to get leads in for their B2B business all the time, so I just wanted to share because the results so far have been pretty damn good :-). I hope someone finds this helpful and if you're looking for a quick way to bring in some B2B leads, this seems worth the investment.

Anyone care to give a brother some advice?",goots,35,7,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/lwrim/i_need_a_pickmeup_im_slowly_getting_burnt_out_and/,"About two years ago, my father started a small [web-based training production business](http://www.workliferesources.net). When I joined him (after finishing Active Duty in the US Army), he clearly wasn't pulling in enough revenue to hire me full-time, so I got a practice management job in a local university hospital and assisted him part-time.

My goal was to take MBA classes across the street after work and eventually move full-time into my dad's company after straddling two jobs for a while (and maybe reducing to a part-time job in the hospital to help ease the transition, while still making a decent wage). I've put in a lot effort into establishing the family business; I cobbled the website together, established some adwords campaigns, and organized some free consulting and sponsorship through the business school I'm attending. Which is great, except for the fact that I feel like nothing is being accomplished and I'm at the end of my rope.

New clients are coming in so slowly that I don't see anything worthwhile on the horizon. I'm working from 7:30 to 5:30 at the hospital, 7:00 to 10:00 for my father, taking night classes one day a week, supporting a new marriage and new house, and fighting off depression caused by a lot of stress. It's been this way for about a year now -- lack of sleep, constant disappointment, light mocking from in-laws about ""having to work all the time""... to quote LOTR, I feel like butter scraped over too much bread, and I'm ready to up and leave.

I know this entrepreneurship thing is supposed to be rough, ""burn the midnight oil"" and all that, but this is just horrible. We need more clients for me to leave the hospital and make my schedule less balls-to-the-wall, but I have no idea how to get them or where to begin. Everything I try isn't working. I'm just tired, I need some new, clear insight, I can't concentrate, and I have many miles to go before I sleep.

It's a program that removes and blocks malware on Windows.  I've been in business for 14 years.  When I started business rapidly increased and I made good money.  Over the years the market has saturated and sales have fallen to where I'm thinking it's about time to pack it in.

I've always known that a lot of people were using cracked versions of my software or using stolen license keys.  I've done my best to mitigate the theft while trying not to burden paying customers.  I've lowered the price and offer incentives but nothing seems to work.

I crunched some numbers today and found that over the last 28 days there have been ~7,500 users of the retail client vs ~3000 30-day trial users (counted separately) vs ~444 active retail licenses.

I've had to infer some things.  My program is generally run once a day or less per user as it is scheduled to run nightly by default.  So there are ~7000 or 94% of all users using a cracked copy per month.  Unless my math or assumptions are horribly wrong this is really awful.  In any case sales are bad.  About 40 a month.

The idea of 48 Hour Websites is to take the hassle and cost out of setting up a website. My target customers are small business owners who generally don’t have the time to organize a website, and in a lot of cases, can’t afford it either. A few perfect examples are builders, pubs, and small local shops.

Each website starts off with 3 pages (home, about and contact) with additional pages being added on later as required. This allows me to get the sites up within 48 hours, then discuss extra additions with the customer once they are ‘in Google’. The cost for a basic site is $499 (extra pages at $100 each) which includes 12 months hosting, domain registration and the construction of the site. To order a website, the customer simply completes a questionnaire, with the answers being used to create the site content.

I construct the websites using one of 3 basic HTML templates I created. Even though they are a little plain, they allow me to have a website fully constructed within a few hours. Plus the customers I'm targeting aren't after a big site with all the bells and whistles, just something simple that’s easy to navigate and allows their customers to find them in Google.

I also decided to make website updates and changes free (for example, changing photos or text). I believe it is a very good marketing point, especially considering many of my customers won’t need to make any updates at all.

Things have actually been going very well, with around 25 signups over the last few months. My main method for contacting potential customers (so far) has been cold calling. I know many people won’t agree with that, but I've found a few ways I can make the call quick and easy for the business owner. With the intention of the cold call simply get their OK to send an email through with all the details in it, rather than waste their time on the phone explaining everything. 

I also feel the ‘small business owner to small business owner’ approach works really well when cold calling, and I doubt any of these business owners have ever had a call regarding a website.

Majority of the customers I have found so far have come from Facebook, and the rest from searching for newspaper and phone directory ads for businesses that don’t have a website (or list an @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, etc email address). With the businesses from Facebook, I will use their logo to create a draft website with one of my templates, then send a link to it along with my email. So far I have signed up 100% of the customers I have done this with.

Does this sound like an idea that could be expanded on? My short-term success has been very encouraging, but being from a small rural town in Victoria, Australia, I’d love to be able to expand and start contacting small businesses around the country.

I'm at the stage now where I'm looking into really pushing this business, but would love some thoughts and feedback! I'd also love to hear any tips I could use for marketing this idea!

**Web Dev** - We did get out of the competition with template monster (or the dozens of other web firms that pop up every day) and don't compete on smaller sites. I feel we've always differentiated ourselves by having a vested interest in our clients' success.

More on the Problem - Over the years we've tried various incentive structures, and I know we pay our people well (although I know this is relative - we pay roughly 2x median salary in our area, but definitely not as much as various markets for the same work) so unsure if the autonomy, mastery, purpose applies directly, but that's been my issue - taking money off the table (paying well to start) hasn't helped (much) and I want more ownership of everyone's tasks/projects. 

Have you found motivating people a challenging part of being an entrepreneur/owning a business? Setting goals is nice, but it seems only the rarest of individuals meets or exceeds those goals. And even the best people don't seem to need a lot of direction. ",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1363115304.0,,,True,t3_1a3xy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1a3xy7/company_stock/,

I started  [Snapclass](http://www.snapclass.com) 14 months ago and after 3 pivots have launched again. Like most entrepreneurs I thought it would be easy, I wouldn't make the same mistakes everyone else did. I wrong, but here is what I've learned...

1.) **You will make mistakes**: Everyone single one of you will make mistakes, if you think you're the exception, you're the one making the biggest mistakes of all. What truly differentiates a great entrepreneur from a bad one is how fast you release you've made a mistake and correct your course. In action is the worst mistake you can make!

2.)**Sales &amp; Marketing are king** Todd Wyder an advisor of ours had this to say, ""I think the biggest epiphany any entrepreneur gets is that at the end of the day, it's all about marketing."" This info never really sank in until recently, but I'm glad it finally did. Making a great product doesn't mean you have a great company! Plenty of mediocre products have CRUSHED better products by superior marketing. Don't get crushed, start now.

3.) **Leverage the community**: Find people in your community or online to help. Find advisors, find mentors, find people that care. DO NOT under any circumstance pay these people or give them equity. You want people who care, not people looking for a slice of the pie.

4.) **Get of out the building**: Many of you know may know this term from [Steve Blank's - Startup Owner's Manual](http://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/). You should be going to [meetups](http://www.meetup.com), [office hours](http://www.ohours.org), tech talks and whatever you can find in your community. Build your network! Listen to people especially potential customers. Surround yourself with successful people and you will become successful.

5.) **You are going wear many hats**: If you hate accounting, sorry it's part of your job now. You will need to know a little bit everything, being an expert in very few things. Don't be afraid to outsource! Here is a [list of resources](http://steveblank.com/tools-and-blogs-for-entrepreneurs/) to help.

1339496412.0,30,self.Entrepreneur,uxqes,"Reddit Entrepreneurs: I'm looking to build some great software for one or maybe even two of you rising stars, on my dime! Let's take your idea, and my software know-how, and build something cool for your business!",ILL_DO_IT,42,12,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/uxqes/reddit_entrepreneurs_im_looking_to_build_some/,"Are you a reddit entreprenuer? Is there a piece of software that would be specific to your business type / vertical that would greatly improve your business day? Is there a piece of software that you would love to own, but just cannot buy - because it doesn't exist? Does it exist, but cost way too much for what it does?

Well, today could be the day that changes all of that! I'm looking for one, maybe two entreprenuers, whose business life would flourish that much better with the perfect software solution. The best idea(s) will get their software built free, and own a 50/50 share of the intellectual property rights. Yes, you heard right: I'm going to build it for you, and give you half of the rights to it. The only rights I'll reserve are the right to sell the software myself (my real ulterior motive!), the right to name the software as I please, and of course the right to modify and customize the software as I see fit. There may be some other rights in there, but what I think is good about this situation, is that you should also have the same rights too!

My name is Jim, and I write software. I've been a software developer for almost 20 years, and I've worked for companies large and small throughout my time.

You can either list your ideas for the perfect software for your business below, or send me a PM. I'll be getting back to people ASAP, and I look forward to hearing from anyone interested. No idea is too ridiculous, but I do want to put some ground rules in-place:

1) You should either have, or be in the process of having your own business that doesn't currently ""depend"" on the software. In other words, the software that I build for you can't be what makes or breaks your business. I'm looking to build software for businesses that are successful without this software, but would be better off with that software. This rule essentially keeps the ""I have a great idea, just build my entire business for me"" folks, at bay.

2) The software will be built on my own time, at my own pace. I have a full-time position as it stands, and although I can assure folks of software quality and workmanship, I can't unfortunately also deliver free AND fast at the same time. If I could do that, I wouldn't be browsing reddit before work. Does that make sense? No? You're right, I should browse reddit all the time - oh me!

2a) Although I can assure you of quality workmanship, I cannot, absolutely cannot and will not be held liable for defects, bugs, errors, omissions, or losses to you, your business, your neighbor, or anyone else that gets damaged due to use of the software. Let's face it: I'm not out to build the next stock trading platform, nor am I going to build the next facebook for you. Chances are pretty slim that the software that I build for you will cause you a loss. In the event that it does, however, I wash my hands of any liability (but might - just might fix bugs as they come up - though I do not make that guarantee, for obvious reasons, either).

3) I'd like anyone who wishes to work with me to put some real thought into this, and if chosen, you will be expected to put in the time and effort needed on your side to make the software great! Let's face it - this is YOUR business, not mine. I'm just writing the software for you. No one knows your business like you do, and that's why I need you as much as you might need me.

4) I will ultimately be in charge of what platform(s) and language(s) the software is written in. If this software ends up requiring an expensive platform to run on, while I may develop the software to run on said plaftorm, I will not be providing that platform for you. IOW: if this software requires, for whatever reason (hypothetical here), an Oracle DB, and SAP integration, then I will not be providing Oracle, nor SAP components for your business. I, of course, will make every attempt possible to ensure that this software runs on your existing hardware and software, but cannot be held liable to provide any hardware or software for your business. That part is on you, good sir or madam.

5) I really dislike rules. They limit us, bind us, and keep us from reaching as far as we might otherwise be able to. Unfortunately, there are probably some other rules that I'm not thinking of, but what you can be sure of, is that you will always get an equal say in how these rules are implemented from here-on. IOW: the rules I've stated are probably the only ones that I will lay down, but there may be some others that we can agree upon later!

That's all folks, I really hope there's someone out there that will take me up on their offer. It's a great opportunity for both of us to build something cool!

**UPDATE**

Folks, it's been about 7 hours since I made this post, and thought I'd check to see if anyone even caught my post, and well... I've received a fair amount of replies and PMs. Keep them coming, I won't be making a choice until the posts &amp; PMs start to die down.

So far, not a lot of the requests seem as outlandish, too very specific, nor restrictively large as I thought some might be. This is a great thing to see, and all of the ideas I've read so far have so much potential. I wish I could write software for all of you! I really do!

Could use some help! I have recently been contacted by a family member from China that's trying to import cars from the USA. He is a registered car dealer in China. The cars will be registered in China, but the owners will commute to HK on a daily basis.

They are looking to import brand new luxury cars (BMW, etc) rather than your average Honda/Toyota. Apparently the cars are fairly hard to come by and sell for almost double-triple the price from the US market.

We have looked into the cost of import tax, shipping, and passing customs. We believe we might have a company that will take care of this.

We will be buying a large fleet of cars at once.

I myself am unsure of how possible and lucrative this business might be from my end. Does anyone think this is a good idea and if not, can you give me criticism on why this might be a bad idea? Also, maybe any recommendations on solid shippers? It doesn't hurt to look for more than one importer right? :)

I blog for a site called [3ChicGeeks](http://3ChicGeeks.com). It is a geek culture blog with a hipster twist, as the three of us are admitted hipster queens. We try to give our readers a classy, fashionable and insightful take on geek culture, with a current posting schedule of Monday-Wednesday-Friday. We've won a bloggie and got featured on Freshly Pressed, and have received a generally positive response to our work.

Of course, we would like to make money with our blog. Expand into the stratosphere, all that lovely stuff. And, of course, we know very little of business - only what we've picked up along the way from our families, random textbooks and various business subreddits. I tend to be the one who comes up with ideas in regards to expansion. 

Projects we currently have on the table:

3 Chic Geeks Magazine - published via MagCloud and aim to sell print copies to local cafes and bookstores in the hipster areas of NYC. Quarterly publication, main stream of revenue - advertisements. It would be coming out on our one-year anniversary, November 5th 2013.

Self-hosting and adding ads + sponsored posts - while we are currently running the wordpress.com version of AdSense, we do not expect this to be a main source of revenue although it's the easiest one to implement. We aim to make the spots for ads, sponsored posts and affiliates very limited so as to give our audience a more high-quality experience. 

&gt;Our current stats:

&gt;Total views: roughly 217k

&gt;Monthly average views: ~40k 

&gt;Subscribers: 575 (we gained 75 since April 2nd)

&gt;FB likes: 457

&gt;Twitter followers: 270

&gt;Founded: November 5th, 2012

Please note, that beyond social networking we do not use paid ads of any sort because we're poor like that. 

Our goal is, again, to make money blogging, and we are open to expanding beyond blogging with the 3 Chic Geeks brand. I am hoping to get feedback from the people who have more experience with growing a business than I do. So, if you have advice on how to expand, how to grow our follower and reader base, how to get advertisers or anything in general on how we could improve this site, I would be eternally grateful. 

Thank you for reading and I hope to hear everyone's thoughts. :)",,False,self,t5_2qldo,False,,,True,t3_1c704q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1c704q/my_friends_and_i_started_a_geek_culture_blog_just/,

I find that the only way that I commit to something is if I am obligated somehow, ie. College, A job, the military, or a girlfriend who loves me. 
I can't get my ass to sit down and complete a programming tutorial and continue to build something or learn a new skill. Starting a business goes as far as planning, building a landing page,and doing nothing with it the following morning. I am bright, motivated, opportunistic, and entrepreneurial. But I just can't make it to day 2 of any personal venture. It is by far my weakest trait and my most urgent to fix. I should say that I have a decent shot at building an ad platform with outsourced coders, but my $10k budget ran out and I gave up, this was about 6 years ago. I could be afraid of failure, but i think there is something else going on as well. 
Any thoughts on this? I'm probably not the only one like this, perhaps there are books out there that deal with this issue. I could see a therapist about it if need be, but r/entrepreneur, any advice or resources you recommend?

1348531195.0,30,self.Entrepreneur,10f5vm,Just lost what would have been the largest sale for my company,whollyhemp,39,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/10f5vm/just_lost_what_would_have_been_the_largest_sale/,"I guess this is less of a question and more of a light rant. 

I just got out of class and checked my phone to see an email from [wholesale company I submitted my products to when I first opened and subsequently forgot about] with an abnormally large number of units. I put my stuff down and double checked to make sure. Yeah. HUGE. 

I rushed home and checked the wholesaler's vendor page. That's when I remembered something: they made me sell all my products AT COST.

While this wouldn't necessarily be an issue, the fact that it was such a large order in what is a relatively slow time for sales made me begin to worry.

I started doing the math, and I could hire on two more temporary employees and ship it out at a loss with the hopes that getting my product into this many hands would ensure many future customers.

I would have to wait on raw materials which would delay shipment by one week. Not too bad, I thought. I was ecstatic. This was it. 

I contacted the wholesaler to see what the shipping time frame was. They wouldn't answer. I called, emailed, and left voicemails- no response. It was like they were all gone. 

So I waited a few hours hoping they would get back to me. Nothing.

I finally did the one thing they said I could not do- I contacted the company which purchased my products. When they answered, I thanked them for their business, explained the situation and asked if there was any possibility the order could be delayed by a week. 

They were very responsive, said they were happy to be supporting small businesses, and had heard great things about my product through a friend. One thing. They needed the order in a few days. 

OUCH. 

I told them that I was unfortunately unable to fulfill the order and they said if there is another similar need they will come back to me. 

They always say the greatest danger of owning a small business is growing too fast. 

Sending inferior product/late orders is unacceptable. I would rather begrudgingly turn down an order than lower my standards. I also could not keep that much inventory on hand 'in the hopes of receiving another hail mary order'. 

But it does pang me to think 'what if...'

Essentially the gas station, in order to entice customers will randomly move the decimal over once or twice a day for customers. Word spreads, and they get plenty of business. I haven't verified this so I dont know how much truth there is to it, but I can see how this would be successful for encouraging customers and repeat visits.

My question is are there any other avenues or businesses where a similar promotion would work? A cleaning business that randomly chooses 1 customer a day to refund a portion of their bill? A pizza shop that gives away one pizza a day?

I'm trying to get some ideas on entrepreneurship and I want to know more so I thought the best way is to ask you :)

If you've got 5 minutes I would appreciate if you could answer these questions, it would mean a lot to me.

1. What are your thoughts on taking entrepreneurship as a major in University?

1. How does your Tuesdays looks like?

1. Thinking of where you're at now, would you recommend others to try becoming an entrepreneur? How would you convince them?

1. What's your biggest frustration that your business constantly faces?

Thank you for helping me out,

The old site was terribel, just pictures of the products, no model, about 6 clicks from product page until final sale, and only paypal. I've finally gotten an actual onsite payment (shoutout to PayMill, no hassle, no merchant account, basically the european stripe), one page checkout/payment, and a much stronger backend in WooCommerce (had opencart before).

I did also pay someone to create the customized version of the theme (after having made the first myself, and kidna failed), and i personally really like it, but i'm not sure how the navigation and user friendliness is to someone else, it's quite easy to get tunnel vision when working on a project like this :/ So any comments are really appreciated (on anything other than the store as well, if you feel so inclined), before i put more oomph into my marketing efforts of the online store.

Here's the webpage:
http://www.odinfightwear.com/

Most organic traffic comes into the front page, i tend to divert the few adwords customers i have now (very geo targeted ATM), to the product pages themselves, dependent on their keywords.

I don't consider myself a professional in any of those fields, but I believe to be good enough to start earning some money (if you're interested, [here's](http://imgur.com/a/VR9QX) an album with some of my work).

I've never managed to earn much doing either of those things, partly due to the fact that I had next to no time to really focus on them while in school and I started working full time the minute I graduated; the only time I had left was during the weekends, and the people who would hire me were mostly (cheap) friends. I also saw them mainly as hobbies and didn't put much effort into promoting my skills.

Now I want to spend the next few months working every angle to turn said skills into something that I can actually live (survive?) off of.

I guess if I were to sum this all up in one question it would be: **How do I market myself as an artist?**

I scrape together freelance jobs here and there, for both IT work and web dev, but it's nowhere near enough money to live on.

Thank you everyone whom responded to my original post - I would love to do all the ideas with you guys, but will start with the most popular one.    
  

As the [top up voted idea from my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/xz5o5/choose_and_ride_along_with_a_reddit_startup/) was the Microphone Ball, I've taken the following actions:  

1) I've spent the weekend going through around 4000 patents to see if I'm infringing on anyone. So far so good! Am meeting with an attorney friend of mine a bit later this week to discuss what I need to do in terms of patents etc to protect myself. *Would you like me to film the conversation?*  

2) Based on input from Xenos345 &amp; sigmaecho, I've spent today looking into a [fully enclosed microphone-ball prototype](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoGdVLYRM_s). Its definitely doable, and I've ordered the last parts I need. More on this when I have a working microphone built into the ball.  

I also made a quick [intro video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtWhSyyUbLU) to the first prototype, to give you an idea of how it works.  

Finally, I would like to thank BrianFranklin for pointing out that KikMik might have negative connotations in some countries. As such, *I need a new name!* Any ideas?  

There are probably a bunch of other things I should be doing right now, so feel free to tell me what they are. Also, Xenos345 kicked things off by offering to beta test the ball when it is ready. I would love to have some more people do that, so let me know if you are interested!

1373211841.0,29,self.Entrepreneur,1ht0ah,Should I allow two technical cofounders to have 50% of their equity (30% each) unvested 4 months in?,vestingissues,35,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ht0ah/should_i_allow_two_technical_cofounders_to_have/,"The background:

I'm a non technical guy &amp; came up with an idea, entered pitch competition won ($500), drew up wireframes, validated it with customer feedback and made business plan, entered another entrepreneurial competition (15 min presentation) won ($5000). Met two iOS developers, we got along well and they liked the idea so they joined the team. We agreed on an equity split of (40/30/30).


We got into an incubator and have been working here full-time since after exams since may. The app is nearly done and we're planning to launch in august.


I have applied for multiple accelerators - we were even shortlisted for the best one in our country. The one developer was 100% in to join us while the other was going to go back to school. Then the one that was game for the acceleration had lots of influence from his parents and family and he decided he is going to go back to school. This makes us unable to get into that accelerator. We apply to another one that isn't as prestigious but they more likely to have us come in with just one full time founder. 


I can deal with them developing while at school. The issue is that after the one came back from a family vacation, he says he wants 50% of his equity unvested. I asked why - he said he because he believes what they've built is worth 50% of equity. The other developer hears this and obviously agrees. This is just the start of the app - an MVP.


We agreed we will have this conversation at another point in time (before we release the app) but they seem pretty keen on getting 50% of equity unvested.


Two reasons I can think they want the 50%:

* 1. they truly believe they're work is worth 50% of their equity

* 2. they are worried two of the cofounders will for whatever reason kick the other one out.


Notes on reason 1: They haven't thought out all the other features we are going to include in the app (there's a lot). They haven't realized all the other work dealing with the startup (I don't know what to expect because it's my first tech startup). Haven't taken into account that we might have a major pivot.


Notes on reason 2: With 50% equity already unvested, it will have a physiological impact on their motivation. This would likely lead them to not care so much about their work. I thought of an comparison ""If we get paid $100,000 for 3 years of work, but get $50,000 of that after 4 months of work and we can keep that even if we walk off - it's likely we would walk off before the 3 years end."" So if one us doesn't care so much about our work it's likely that the other two would want to do something about it. 

Not only will it effect our individual motivation but if one cofounder leaves with half their equity and isn't working - it will effect the motivation of the team. 

It will also effect us when trying to raise VC funds. 


At the incubator I told of the the directors (who also happens to be a partner at an Angel Network) about this issue and he said he would help have a talk with us and explain to them the issues about their request.


Also how much (if any) extra equity should I ask for because I'm going to the accelerator and not going back to school while the others are? Keep in mind I have put in about $5000 into this startup (from the winnings) which has been paying for the developers rent, commuting expense and our other expenses (currently equity split is 40/30/30).

Ideally I would like to keep paying the bills with the existing business while turning up the volume on one of the other ventures.  My problem is that I have so many ideas, I never seem to make much progress on any one thing.  Does anyone else have any experience with this problem? I would love to hear some advice / stories on how you broke out of your rut, pivoted to a new idea, or otherwise cut the chafe and made one thing REALLY happen.

Recently, I've seen an uptick in comments trying to tell new entrepreneurs to spill their idea, because execution is the only thing that matters.

While an idea is nothing without execution, some ideas can be easily developed by visionary entrepreneurs that have quick access to capital. A few years ago, when I was running three companies at a time, many people came to me with their ideas. They trusted me, so there wasn't an issue with me stealing their idea. But let me tell you something, there are people like me, and much smarter than me, that can hear an idea, and find 10 ways to improve it.

Is someone going to steal your hometown coffee bar idea? No. Will someone steal your website idea or app idea? It depends on how much information you give. 

When looking for advice, you are in a tough spot. You want help, but you also know you may have a gold mine on your hands. Please just use caution when divulging information.

I have not decided with whom to proceed yet, but I will have meetings with them very shortly.

My question is: What is reasonable to offer an angel investor? What will angel investors generally want? How many percentages of the company is reasonable to give up? Do they expect to have 51% and control of the venture or is it more rasonable to expect that they want between 10% and 30%?

Edit:wow,everyone has such great stories,i guess i should share mine too.Too bad i do not have the level of success of probably all of the redditors below.
when i was 14 i became my own third party supplier and retailer for a trading card game called duelmasters.

(this was during the japanese revival of the game after the decline and subsequent discontinuation of the english series by wizards of the coast,the japanese series was sold at a high price (300JPY/4.50SGD for most booster packs with 5 cards each,4600JPY/70SGD for most structure decks) due to indirect suppliers and a seller's market )

Made only 20% of the total cost of goods available for sale(total revenue was actually 180% of COGAS) due to a large amount of drawings by me to buy cards for my personal use

i guess it taught me that my business should not interfere with my hobby and not to pass up a good opportunity.
It has also taught me that the Internet isn't everything when it comes to retail,building a good relationship with customers offline and being a respected member of the community you serve also helps.

Is there a certain software(accounting, CRM, smartphone app, design crowdsourcing, email marketing) you find invaluable that you think everyone should look at?

Is there a service you love that you're subscribed to? (email newsletter, phone service, lead generation)

Physical product you're in love with? (specific phone, alarm clock, notebooks, pens, books, magazines etc.)

Do you do anything you find clever that helps you run your business? (virtual assistants, referral system in place)

I'll start. 

I use [evernote](http://www.evernote.com) to keep track of articles i read on the internet, my daily to-do list, and marketing ideas. I find using it and the smartphone app has been insanely good for me. I always seem to have ideas while i'm out away from my computer and the mobile app has been awesome. 

I'm looking into the different CRM software right now. I signed up for 37 Signal's [Highrise's](http://highrisehq.com/) free account just now. I'm thinking about hiring a virtual assistant on [odesk](https://www.odesk.com/) to go through some online directories and fill in some prospects to an excel sheet to import to Highrise. Never used odesk or a virtual assistant so it should be interesting. 

I have an Android phone that isn't capable of being a mobile hotspot. I downloaded an app called PdaNet that lets me hook my computer up to my phone and use my phone's internet when i'm out and about(great for hotels that want to charge you for wifi).

I'm signed up to a few of [inc.com's](http://www.inc.com/) weekly newsletters. I've also signed up to [socialtrigger's](http://socialtriggers.com/) newsletter for some marketing ideas.

I love this sub and have learned a lot.  However, I think that some of the content is pretty weak-sauce at times, most notably ""5 Tips to do X or Y"" type of articles and **super vague** questions from people.

In an effort to build a little more community, I am hoping to get some discussion going so we all know what kind of skills and talents we have in r/entrepreneur.

Here is the question set, it'd be awesome if you'd contribute!

1. Do you currently own a business?

2a.  If yes, what do you do?

2b.  If no, what are you working on?

3. What are your top 3 skillsets, and how long have you been working on them?

**My Answers**

1. Yes

2. I run an online marketing agency that primarily focuses on technical search engine optimization (site architecture, conversion optimization, page speed, etc) and what I call ""real online marketing"" (content planning/promotion, outreach, build marketing systems for clients).  I used to call this SEO, but I've grown to hate that acronym and no longer use it at all.

3. I'm pretty good at:

A. Going from idea -&gt; revenue.  I've started a bunch of mini businesses: growing and selling produce to restaurants, selling info products, selling friends and families items on ebay (back when ebay was good), etc.

B. Rapidly figuring out what sucks about a marketing strategy and how to improve it.  After being in this game for so long, I have a good knack for which of the million different ways to promote a business will work for the specific business and market that they are in.

C. Systems and process. This is what took me from basically creating a job for myself (consultant) to an agency where all of the work doesn't rely 100% on my being behind a computer working away.

D. (oops a 4th).  Strategy.  I played online poker professionally, paid for 4 years of a top 50 university, coached and invested.  I have a very strong handle on strategic though and execution.

**Hope this is helpful and I hope it starts a discussion!  Would love to meet people in all phases of the entrepreneurial journey and with all different types of skillsets!**

Setting up another online store to sell a product (I dont know what product)?  Writing blogs for other people (how do you even get into that?) something else?  Maybe this would be better posted in another forum?

Edit:  To be clear, I do make commission, but I make commission by moving large amounts of product.  I can't do that right now (and that has nothing to do with me).  I have created a marketing and selling plan that will at least triple the company's current sales figures.  Again, I can't implement this until I have something to sell.  I am constantly looking for other sales channels.  However I still do have some free time even after all of that.  To those of you thinking I am cheating the job- I am not.

TLDR: If you don't want to read the entire story, my question is: How do you go about firing a friend who became a business partner, who just isn't putting in as much work.

Backstory:

I started business with my partner about a year ago. We both went to school for the same thing, but specialized in different areas and I thought we would be fantastic business partners.

We started a Web &amp; Graphic Design company and started off well. We branded ourselves, and took on friends of family and got a good little portfolio going.

About 3 months in, I noticed that my partner couldn't do any webwork. I thought, when we started, he had as much experience as I did but apparently I was wrong. It was fine, because he was alright at logos and other small graphic projects.

I made a point to say hey, maybe read up a bit about basic html/css/webdesign and he said he would.

A month later, and I noticed I was doing ALL of the webwork. If I had to ask him to go in and do some basic changes to a site, he had no idea where to start, he didn't even know how to get the site set up through FTP.

I offered to pay for an online course, $50/month out of the business fund, to learn the basics of web, and get the most out of it that he could.

He had it for 3 months, and when I checked the progress there was little to none, and it showed in the lack of knowledge when asked to do things.

This resulted in a serious email stating that something needed to change, I wanted a partner with passion and drive to learn more, especially in the web/graphic design industry, where it's constantly changing and you need to be up to date. He said he'd change, and work really hard.

This is where we're at now, nothing has changed. I'm doing 90% of the work and only getting half the money. 

Part of it is me needing to grow some balls and tell him to take a hike, but we were friends before. Big mistake, starting business with friends. I now know that. 

So my question is has anyone had an experience where they needed to can their business partner, who was a friend before, and how did you go about it?

Turns out he is  very wealthy and if I can come up with an idea either related to strip clubs or any other bar,club and I can provide a rough business model until Wednesday, I will get the money I ask and I can run/own my business.We agreed that the the place is gonna be in London. I have a lot of ideas regarding what to do with a already running strip club, but I have never opened a venue in my life. So does anyone has any advice on where to start? I need to show him a clear vision on what I want to do, and that it will be profitable. How do I go about doing that?

In a nutshell I have a meeting with a millionaire who will give me insane amounts of money for a new business if I can convince him that it will be profitable.

About him being a fraud - as I commented on hyh123, there is 0 point of trying to cheat money out of me, if anything it is the other way around :) I wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented with great ideas and gave me enough links and ideas. I will use them to the best of my ability. I will make a rough business frame, based on our club in London, which is very profitable and will add a couple of my own ideas that I know will work. After some research I have decided that it is safer to buy an existing strip club with existing licence, otherwise it can take a year just to get it, and if I don't have any other business's running that will generate me money, it is not  worth it.  Again thank you for everything, I will work on this, and will let you know how it goes.

At this stage, my interests lean heavily to the computational side of things and I am working in a laboratory in my department this summer where such work will be my focus. 

It's also been a very long-standing goal of mine to get into programming to develop skills that will be a boon both for my work in science and outside of it: the project I'm doing this summer will allow me to start gaining exactly those skills, which I want to carry on building on long after it's over.

I've been considering my future, and I definitely want to do a PhD (three years duration in the UK) after I graduate to develop expertise in an area of chemistry I enjoy. However I've recently become very interested in self-employment/business and concerns that exploit scientific research and expertise: scientific consulting, independent laboratories, developing specialist scientific software etc. 

So I'd like to hear case studies of any scientists who've made the transition from pure academic to a combination of academic and entrepreneur - my dream really - or even to being entrepreneur alone. What was your background, where are you now, and how did you get there after acquiring what sort of skills?

I have tried elance and what not but things were hard. Since I usually have multiple contractors (2-3 at a time) per project, working on design, coding etc., it is really hard to have them work in sync as they are not physically together. Moreover, they are not experts when it comes to tools for management. Some of them don't even know how to use Github. All in all, it is painful to find the right people. I hope some of you will agree. 

This gave me an idea for a new startup. I am planning to offer ""Startup as a service"".

My idea is to help budding entrepreneurs with the right idea to execute it fast. The way it works is, we talk about your idea and if it interests me I will become an equity partner in your company. Then I will hire the team for ~~your~~ our project and provide it to you at cost price. You pay a low price for the talent you need and you get to have your entire team under one roof working on your project. Finally, after a year or two when our company and its needs grow, I help you setup your own large office with the team that has been working for you and provide you assistance setting an offshore development team.

The way I would distinguish from other outsourcing companies is that I am not after the monthly payments but my main source of revenue will be the successful startups. Therefore, you can rest assured that I am equally interested in not only delivering your product but to make it a success. 

My question is:

1. Would you pay for such a service, although it might be little expensive than the freelancers as you need to pay for overheads of running an office. If you were to think of a number, how much would you like to pay for a person per hour on average? 

2. Would you mind giving away your equity and rather pay extra to keep 100% of it? 

3. If you went this way, would you like the offer of being able to have your own offshore development team after a year? 

4. What would you like me to have that would qualify me to be able to pull this through? I currently have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from a decently ranked school in USA. I own a few startups and know the drill. I am from India and that is where I am going to start this company. I am passionate about the idea to be able to help entrepreneurs. Is that enough? 

5. Do you think it will add to my portfolio, if I was part of a startup accelerator such as y-combinator?

I have an enormous need to be my own boss and run my own business. I'm capable, smart enough(I hope) and currently don't have any disabilities other than some minor short term memory problems. Nothing a phone reminder can't sort out. I also have had some pretty good ideas on what to do and what could be profitable. But there's a problem. I've been trying to do something now for close on 7 years. Nothing ever comes of it.

I've done some deep introspection and came to realize that I'm stuck on committing to a business and doing the work that needs to be done. It could be just plain laziness but somehow I feel the word 'resistance' fits better.

Does anyone have experience with this? How can I break though this?

**Some background info to paint the picture clearer.**

* I'm currently doing a job I'm just good enough at and which doesn't pay well. I don't like it and I won't be able to do it in a few years either.(medical reasons)

* My degree(a lib arts, ha-hey...) and working experience is very specialized to my current occupation and won't be useful in almost any other field.

* I have very little money and a wife to support(she can't work). I do have access to financial resources though(rich parents) but I'm afraid of them losing money if my business goes south. I couldn't stand for that. Not after I feel I've disappointed them thus far.

* I'm in my 30s. I'm very discouraged, depressed and feel left behind by my peers. I'm also not death, disability or health insurable because of health reasons. I live paycheck to paycheck. These things keep me up at night. A lot.

* I have no passions. Could be because of stress and whatnot.

* I have no debt except for my small car.

* I don't have any friends really, not having money have caused the ones I had and I to move apart. That means anything I want to start would have to be a one-man show at first. This is terrifying. 

OK, all the mushy stuff out of the way. You get the picture. I need to sort my shit out. I'm getting older, I know I'll be facing huge health bills in the future and time is running out.

So, how do I mentally get myself to get out of my head, choose a business direction and knuckle down and do the job? How do you do that after what feels like a decade of constant failure?

I'm thinking of maybe having little packages full of snacks from different areas of the world. For example.. Banana chips from India, Crystal potato bars (something I found on alibaba, looks interesting, not sure about FDA or health concerns there though) from China, and Thai rice crackers. These could be in the Asian pack and cost maybe 20$.

Maybe I'll make a few YouTube videos about history of potato chips and snacks in different regions. Maybe I could also through in different sodas.

I enjoy reading posts here and on /r/business , and both subreddits often feature posts such as ""what do you think of my new website"" or ""do you think this is a good idea?"" - which is completely fine.  However, I thought that it may be a good idea to create a home for just posts like that, and I just created /r/elevatorpitch .

How did you raise the capital?,pawn_guy,30,4,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/usogo/what_kind_of_startup_costs_did_your_company_have/,"I'm in the process of starting my own business, and we're spending a considerable amount of money to get it off the ground. Luckily I have a partner who is able to put up enough equity for us to borrow the money through the SBA loan program.

We're starting a pawnshop, and to do this we're borrowing $670k. The basic breakdown of the start-up costs is $200k for infill (remodeling, fixtures, equipment, etc.), $225k for inventory, and $245k for working capital. The reason for such a large inventory cost is that firearms and jewelry are expensive items. Also, much of the working capital is money that we expect to loan out since we'll be starting with a $0 pawn balance and no pawn revenue.

As a very business minded person, anytime I go into a store or other business I wonder how much it cost to start that company. So I'm curious what kind of start-up cost your company had and how you raised that money.

On a side note, I know this doesn't really apply to most at-home business that were started on the side or service businesses that began with no employees.

Some trends I've been noticing in the books recommended here and elsewhere:

1. They're tech/web-based. This isn't bad, per se, I'm just not a web-savvy guy (at least in terms of design and programming).

2. The more annoying thing is that in almost every rags-to-riches book, there's some version of ""my roommate happened to go on to found this company called Google"" or ""my girlfriend's father is Bill Gates"" or ""my Dad gave me a $50,000 loan."" This doesn't help most people, and it's such a huge turning point for many of these books (yet usually gets treated as something very minor by the author).

What I'm looking for are some books that give been there, done that advice on starting a business, not necessarily web-based, and that don't have that glossed over ""I had a rich friend"" deus ex machina moment.

Thanks in advance.

I've been digging around in my notes, organising them and have realised that in an ordered format, they would make a valuable resource for anyone interested in building out simple ideas on a limited budget. For example, tools to use when you're at certain stages of your project.

It'd be great to get feedback, hear what topics you're interested in or any pain points you find with getting started e.g finding ideas, validating, hosting, naming, finding domains, outsourcing, automating, driving traffic etc

I am looking to substantiate a new startup idea I have worked on over the past few weeks. Any advice, suggestions or criticisms are welcomed.

In my experiences, note-taking in college is an extremely inefficient process. Whether you are physically writing the notes, or typing them into a personal word document, I believe the process can be improved. My idea will create a cloud-based platform where college students can share, rate and collaborate on one another’s notes. This differs from current note taking applications (Evernote, Google Drive, etc.) by forcing the user to write his/her notes in an outline format. The system can then take their notes and generate summaries, study guides, etc. per lecture/semester. 

 

Ultimately, we will provide students a platform to efficiently write and format class notes. By design, we believe this will improve overall performance and collaboration. The questions I would like to ask is…

Can you see value in this platform?

How would you see yourself using the Application?

Do you think forcing the user into a note-taking format would hinder their note taking experience or improve it?",,False,self,t5_2qldo,False,,,True,t3_1hbkk5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hbkk5/collaborative_notetaking_application_idea/,

Most of the bottles we get are from clubs here in Vegas. So a lot of the bottles are over the top or over sized dom, ace of spades, or even patron platinum bottles.

The problem is we don't sell very many. Maybe 15-25 total. maybe 23 because my mom bought 2.

We've adjusted the price, changed lamp shades, added more unique looks, but nothing seems to sell better.

Sometimes there would be several hundred views on ebay, but 0 offers.

can you help me identify the demographic of the customers?

How do we sustain and market to this very small unique customer base?

Should we focus on lowering prices and make up in larger volume? maybe adding touch on capabilities?

Anyway, I've been working on an idea for a web-based app for freelancers (project and client management, quote building, etc.) and until 15 minutes ago I thought this particular idea was *relatively* unique. However, I've been searching for marketing opportunities and I've discovered that someone else has already launched a very similar tool.

So, my question is: do I cut my losses and avoid spending more time on this or continue? I notice that they've missed a couple of features that I'm planning (and I think they're quite important) and they don't seem to have nailed their marketing (since I've never heard of them and I've been looking). On the other hand, they already have 10,000 customers (or email list subscribers according to their site) so they do have a serious head start.

I should add that I spent a quick $20 on Google adwords yesterday advertising beta invitations and got 12 clicks and 4 sign-ups before the money ran out which made me supremely confident that I had something. 

So, am I over-reacting or should I start considering the idea of dropping it and moving on? I'm about 90% sure I should continue on but maybe I'm just being *too* stubborn.

I thought i'd share the progress so far, maybe it'll help those looking to start a business, what to expect, and if anyone still had some good advice to give me as I continue onwards.

**Backstory //**

A long time now, I know i'll enjoy a job that deals with helping people learn more and play with new technology. I've always enjoyed when someone in my family is getting a phone upgrade, and they'll come to me and ask what they should get next. Some family does well with Apple, others with Android, And I just enjoy the fact that they come to me for this advice.

Long story short, My grandparents bought a TV and didn't ask my opinion (bizarre, one time where they didn't). Well when I found out, the first thing I did was look up the tv on Amazon to see the price difference. To no surprise, the television was cheaper on Amazon, by a couple hundred dollars.

It occurred to me that my grandparents didn't even think to price check online. My grandpa is 100% offline and my grandmother has only managed to master email, even then she was using explorer until I told her about google chrome.

There's an entire generation out there that just doesn't know you can buy things online.
And it just so happens that Amazon doesn't have a physical showroom, and Best Buy's prices are marginally higher than Amazon's. So those who stay offline and want technology are stuck with higher prices and don't even know it.

My answer to this problem is to open a physical showroom at the mall in my town (I live in the U.S.)

I would display and allow people to demo everything, from Televisions, to Gaming consoles (new games), Mobile Devices, Laptops, and Cameras.

Go on and find a place where you can physically demo the Apple tv, Roku Box, or any other media box in a store. And a majority of the offline population don't know what netflix or amazon instant is, So they continue paying for overpriced cable subscriptions just because it's all they know.

___________________________________________________________________________

**My progress so far //**

My initial post about this on Reddit got a lot of really good advice and opinions. 
And I went on to make a [Business Plan] (https://plus.google.com/photos/104043119146057910218/albums/5800311728482256353?authkey=CMf5gI-JgNKAfA)

I had to edit the personal information. You understand. I also had trouble making a PDF pretty to look at online. Not the Nerd I thought I was.
Also I'd like to note I personally designed everything about this plan. (I'm a self proclaimed artist, take that as you will.)

I talked with the Local SBA representative in my area, and he did an excellent job at helping me finish the financial parts of the business plan.
After I had my plan together, I went out attempted to get funding.
My first stop was at Chase Bank, and It turns out you have to have credit to borrow money. (I'm young and naive, haha.) Gotta have a credit score higher than 650 before they even look at your business plan. (my credit score was 501), obviously I wouldn't qualify, So i went to a couple of other banks, and they all said the same thing. 

&gt;You need better credit son, what are you stupid?

Alright, so I had to find another way of getting the initial $15,000 I needed to open.
The SBA rep advised me to find an investor or a cosigner for a bank loan.

I found an investor and for privacy reasons I can't tell you who they are, but this is where the business plan played it's most important role. Explaining that I can payback the loan within two years, plus interest, and after explaining my idea and letting them mull it over, I got the OK, and was now $15,000 richer.

In order to open a business checking account you need a DBA.
So, I google my County Clerk and on their website I was able to search if the business name I wanted was available. It was. Which is surprisingly awesome.
So, I went down to the courthouse, asked where the County Clerk was, and applied for a DBA.
Literally took less than 10 minutes, cost about $15 bucks.

So I opened my business checking, money deposited.

Now to get leasing in order.
Went to the Mall, talked with leasing, picked a spot in the mall. (The best spot ever, right in the center of everything, unbelievable.)

Paperwork for that has been completed.

Well after reading around and asking more questions for clarity, I found out about the Affiliate program participation requirements and a particular clause that read...


&gt; // 6. You will not engage in any promotional, marketing, or other advertising activities on behalf of us or our affiliates, or in connection with the Amazon Site or the Program, that are not expressly permitted under the Operating Agreement.  For example, **you will not engage in any promotional, marketing, or other advertising activities in any offline manner**, including by using any of our or our affiliates’ trademarks or logos (including any Amazon Mark), any Content, or any Special Link in connection with an offline promotion or in any other offline manner (e.g., in any printed material, mailing, email or attachment to email, or other document, **or any oral solicitation**).


Here are the [Participation Requirements](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/operating/participation/)

Up until then, I had only been reading through the operating agreement, which didn't even use the word ""offline"".
I figured I might have a little trouble with using the same computers around my showroom to ""check"" people out, But I would try and use their personal phones, or give them my business card and explain as much as I could and hope they go through my site to earn the commission.

This obviously threw me off my streak. I had that terrible sinking feeling in my stomach.

I went into problem solving mode, and contacted Amazon every possible way I could think of.
I called customer support, but the department I needed to reach was only available mon-fri and I found out about the offline clause saturday morning.

So I try the email routine. It takes 24 hours for a response. So I send, and I wait all day.
I couldn't eat. Or move.

I had finally gotten over my fear of talking with people, and I was actually pursuing opening a business! If you knew me on a personal level, you'd understand that this is HUGE for me. I freak out when I have to talk to people on the phone! Haha, it's much worse meeting professional strangers and asking about my business.

Anyways, Monday came, I called the main Headquarters, and They won't send you to the Business Development department unless you ask for someone by name. That department only does contact by snail mail or email. And I wasn't given an email. So I contact the Affiliate Customer Support via Email, and they respond with a physical mailing address and what to send.

So I mail a copy of my business plan along with a cover letter explaining my situation.
I did this a week and half ago on priority shipping.
I contact everyone again trying to get some kind of faster contact, but no one has the info.

The only way I can talk to someone with Amazon is for them to Contact me.
The waiting is killing me. And as big and as busy as Amazon is, I doubt they'll ever get to me.

So, this is story of a big dream.
And I'm hoping this is just the part of the movie where everything bad that can happen does, and in the end, the dream gets achieved.

That's my progress so far on my venture.
Take it as you well. Thank you for reading this ungodly long post. My goodness I went way overboard.

**TLDR; TRYING TO OPEN AMAZON ELECTRONICS SHOWROOM. THINGS GOING GOOD AT FIRST, THEN RAN INTO A LEGAL WALL OF DEATH, AND NO ONE AT AMAZON CAN HELP ME CONTACT THE PEOPLE I NEED TO CONTACT IN ORDER TO PROCEED.**

First off, I am not yet an entrepreneur, but I plan to be in the near future.

Here is my current situation.
-I am in St. Louis Missouri.
- I have $20,000 in my savings.
- I own my own house.
- I am 24
- I am making $40,000 per year at my job.
- My car is paid off.

Now, what I have been pondering hard for about 3 months is: I want to sell my current house (market value is around $100,000), and I want to invest in a 3-4 family townhome. I figure if I find one for $170,000 (which is reasonable around here) I can rent the other three units for $700/mo. That is $2,100 per month minus the mortgage which will be about $1,200 monthly. This leaves me with $900 profit barring any repairs or emergencies that come up.

My question to you guys is:

What are the caveats I should be aware of with this plan? 

I'm sure there are many factors I am overlooking as I have never done this before. 
My 3 year goal would be to stash most if not all of the profit from the units, and invest in another, similar property and be able to quit working my normal job.

What specifics do I need to be weary/aware of?

Been a subscriber of r/investing and r/entrepreneur for some time, and I have noticed that many never talk about marijuana cultivation(which I find surprising, seeing as it's a huge part of the mmj gold rush). I would like to finally open this topic up for discussion, and see what the community thinks of this ever progressing business. 

Medical marijuana cultivation is booming in quite a few places in California, despite the fact that all growing operations are federally illegal. The federal law has not progressed enough to make things any easier on cultivators, and since Obama took presidency, it has actually gotten worse. However, cultivation is booming more than ever (despite rumors that the market is saturated), and it's expected to only grow (literally) from here. 

As a marijuana enthusiast, I decided to take a closer look at the cultivation part of the industry, in order to understand why people would be willing to take the risk. 

**Profitable?**

Extremely profitable, you can literally grow 220 plants in at 32sq ft area. Done properly you can except those plants to yield an average of .5 pounds a piece in a hydroponic sea of green setup (Most profitable, most work), if you are a professional. Most strains in a SoG type of setup harvest within 70 days. Indoor is considered the highest grade, dependent on the strain/quality you can fetch anywhere from 2,400 (Extremely Low End - 3,600 in the SF bay area and surrounding counties/cities. So lets look at the numbers, for every 32sq ft, you can grow roughly 1,100 plants a year. Those 1,100 plants will net you between $2,640,000 - $3,960,000 annually before cost of operation. 

Cost of operation can vary, it gets cheaper per square foot, as the size of the operation increases. However, I am just going to keep this at a 32sq ft area for purposes of consistency. With the cost of lighting (LED), Co2, Nutrients, Median, Hydroponic Table, Mylar, Ventilation, Security, electricity, and most of all property. I am excluding property in this , property price/and associated cost dramatically change, you can add that one in yourself. All and all you can expect to spend around $35,000 (Highest quality everything) for the start up, and $10,000 annually. 

I hope, these numbers give you a bit more information about this industry, what are you thoughts on the industry?

EDIT: I will be back in one hour, feel free to ask any questions. I think it's good for the community to be informed in all industries, especially those that aren't easy to learn about.

Anyways I have an idea that I have been mulling over for many many months and I just need a ""nudge"" to go from a thinker to a do-er. 

Background: I work full time as a service technician. I am in customers homes all day and routinely engage into conversations about employment/business. 

I was servicing a customer about 6-8 months ago who runs a very successful ebay business. After speaking in great length with her I realized that she is making incredible money, and this is something I can do too. She shared with me that last year she paid 39,000 in ebay fees, using 9% as a benchmark I calculated she made gross roughly 430,000 last year. 

She has it set up like so... She pays .06/.15 cents per unit via china manufacturing, and resells them for $1.00-1.25/unit. she then charges a flat 2.00/3.00 shipping and uses a .44 stamp. When I was at her house, that day she had accumulated almost 200 invoices. So it is not large profits, but it's very constant. 

My thought is this- She uses NO technology.. IE- someone purchases 5 auctions at 1.00/piece. she then manually logs into paypal, prints invoice, prints shipping label. 

I've already done some test runs automating both paypal invoice printing as well as shipping labels completely automatic. From speaking with her she spends 6-7 hours a day just doing paperwork and tasks in which could be automated.

I'm forced with both fear and moral dilemmas. First the fear of failure, I've ALWAYS wanted to create my own company. Being 23 years old I feel its a ""now or never"" scenario. I have about 15,000 saved up and figure an initial order will put me out 3-4k + other small fees. 

Secondly is the aspect that I am ""stealing"" someones business in order to make it more streamline and efficient. Should this be crossing my mind? While I was there I gave this lady multiple ideas for automation/time saving, I feel I did what I could to assist her in turn for the information she unknowingly provided. She mentioned she is forced to shut down every other month for a few weeks just to catch up on invoices/accounting. 

I apologize in advance if this is a mess, I'm shooting from the hip at 2:20 am with my brain going 1,000 miles an hour.

Ever since that post about /r/Entrepreneur is disappointing, I've watched multiple times where people have been extremely rude to forum posters basically saying their question was stupid and/or criticizing the OP if they don't like the question being offered.  In the name of ""improving"" the subreddit, this is turning into a bunch of cynics and critics and is going to in effect discourage involvement by newcomers, and end up doing much damage to this subreddit.  

Before that post, occasionally i'd see a rude comment or two, but it seems like people have taken it upon themselves to become the posting police, acting better than others, putting down and degrading people that have basic questions, etc.  I'm getting sick of it and if it doesn't stop I'll find a new place to frequent.

Take this submission for example:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/nkx68/how_does_one_start_an_internet_business_without/

This is a person interested in started a internet business but doesn't know where to begin.  Perhaps the OP didn't do much research or put much effort in but still, you could be respectful and decent to the guy.  The majority of comments in the thread were either sarcastic replies or  insulting the guy and his efforts taken so far.  Few, if any, offered any help whatsoever.  

For the future,  if there are some basic questions that don't meet r/Entrepreneur's guidelines, I'd recommend having some side bar stickies or something like that people can point the OP to instead of insulting them or being rude because their question didn't measure up.

This is just one example.  I've seen similar things in multiple threads since that r/Entrepreneur is disappointing post happened.  
There are people that will visit this subreddit that come from all stages of entrepreneurship.. Those that have multiple successful businesses under their belt, those that are experimenting with getting their first idea going, and those that are maybe for the first time even thinking about the whole entrepreneur concept and just want to throw out a random question.  I think all of these demographics need to be supported and encouraged here.  I don't like where things have been going and wanted to voice my opinion.

We went from charging $250 a video to charging $2500 per 60 seconds of video in a little less than a year. Now we're consistently getting clients for $2500 and up and the trend is that we'll continually be able to increase these costs as we work with larger companies. We complete about 4-6 videos per month. We've done work for Intuit, Metalab, KISSmetrics, and a few other *somewhat* notable companies. We currently have 16 projects in the works and get requests through our website for videos every day.

We're currently a partnership, have a business license and business account and we pay ourselves a very modest salary once a month while we try and build up capital. I use [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) to budget both my personal and business expenses and we're doing pretty well.

I was hoping I could pitch you guys my idea and then get some feedback. If I've broken any rules or posted something that y'all normally don't I will not be offended with the down votes or call outs.

I have a website that is built around the niche ""how to become a doctor"". I have a page for each state explaining how to become a doctor in that state. I receive around 5,000 visitors every month curious on how to become a doctor and other various things, such as how to pass the MCAT, etc. 
I want to get in touch with MCAT prep coaches in every state and offer them the opportunity to be included in a small directory on my site. The perks: they get exposure to targeted visitors in their state. I'd charge $10/month to be listed, which IMO is affordable if you look up the cost per click they would be paying were they to use Google Adwords. They can leave a link to their site (if they have one) in their profile, and of course leave any other relevant information. All this for the price of a Netflix account. 

Do you guys think this is something worth pursuing? My site is growing every month, and although I'm not sending them thousands of prospective leads per month, for $10 what they get is decent (again, IMO). Would love critique, thank you.

I find myself getting swamped by the initialization costs. I need to account for about $40,000 in expenditures at this point just to start and although this may be a relatively small sum...it's incredibly overwhelming for me to deal with.

I guess I'm feeling a bit beat too since one of my co-founders just dipped out to pursue a more ""stable"" career.

While I'm venting:Angel investment seems like an option, but we're executing a very unique service/product. It would be difficult to find a high net-worth individual that would share the same vision.

1345650930.0,25,self.Entrepreneur,yn59f,Some website hints for entrepreneurs,guaboy05,33,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/yn59f/some_website_hints_for_entrepreneurs/,"Some time ago I engaged in a discussion about web stuff, so here is my contribution...original is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/wimb5/this_is_a_reminder_to_make_sure_your_website_is/ and I promised to write some points.
All things here are written from my own experience. I don't promote any business, purpose of this is to help entrepreneurs that need a website, but have no time to dig into the matter googling and recycling a lot of info. But, as always, there is more to it, be aware people.
So we start with hosting...

1.	Hosting type – you must do it yourself, to assess what hosting do you need for your web. Now, most of you will be satisfied with what I call normal and usual hosting – where on the same server you share your space with the others. If you already have website, you can check which other domains are your neighbors: http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-sites-on-web-server/ (it is called “reverse IP domain check""). There are also semi-dedicated and dedicated servers (hosting types). It means that server works only for you, or for a small number of other sites. Further step is to have your own server. But that costs. Those steps would be a must-do only if your web has extensive traffic and lot of web shop activities.
2.	Most of the hosting companies deceive you by mentioning irrelevant facts, hiding important ones. Most common case is that they draw your attention to the amount of space they give, and remain silent about traffic. Now, you can cheaply get, let’s say 20 GB, and then discover that your bandwidth – traffic – is some 30 GB, and most likely, if you run your site well, somewhere during the month your visitors will get “bandwidth exceeded” message. So, keep your eye on this. Also, try to estimate amount of disk space you need on server, you would be surprised how some very frequented places in fact have small amount on data on their servers.
3.	Next, crucial info is “uptime”. It means – what percentage of time your website is really up, meaning it can be accessed. Many companies claim 99,99% uptime, but don’t be deceived. Sometimes it is just sweet promises, and servers do crash, perform maintenance and so on. Also, there are server firewall settings that prevent access to some IP's, be careful here. You can check your uptime if you have some paid service to do it. They will monitor for you. Which brings us to
4.	24 hrs support. That means simply that there are some real people taking care of your possible problems: someone will hack you, or there will be some other mess. You simply mail or chat with the guy, and voila, you are back. That is crucial for any business on the net – some very famous and big hosting companies simply don’t care about your site. Hey, they are busy making money. Or supporting SOPA and PIPA (whatever those are called). So, you have to pay attention: if those guys are doing your backup and respond to your needs – you are a happy person.
5.	Yep, backup. That is real pain. You have to do that, because server can be damaged, hacked, site full of viruses, whatever, and you don’t want your site in which you put time or money or both to simply vanish. And data, especially if you have incoming data on a daily basis. That thing has to be handled with care.
6.	And can be done using magical thing like cpanel. Now, think of cpanel as of your operating system of the website. I mean, who would like hosting that can be run only by ftp. Even if you are not the one that is or will be doing that, believe me, some poor soul that you pay for it will be delighted finding out that you do have cpanel. He will fall in love with you for that.
7.	Because cpanel not only handles all files on the server like it is a part of your computer, it does many useful things. First of all, it handles all of your webmails (mails with your domain name, based on your hosting). Then, it handles all your site databases, and give you powerful tools to repair them, rewrite, all. Then, there is security area that will keep your site safe as possible (keep in mind – every site can be hacked). There is also backup engine. Next, you can monitor all kinds of statistics about your site, amount on info you can get thru awstats is enormous. You don’t need google to do it for you. But from SEO reasons it is good to be connected with google and their webmaster tools. Also, cpanel handles your domain-subdomains-addon domains structure easily. There are other features, you’ll discover them, but my favourite is cpanels service for choosing the open source scripts in which you can create your site (blogs, portals, webshops, forums, you name it – joomla and wordpress are just some of them). That offer depends of the hosting company…
8.	Your final choice of hosting will consist of the info you collect on several parameters like – server disk space, bandwidth, uptime, location, support, cpanel, and after all – price. Don’t be cheap here, especially if you expect your business to be dependent of the internet presence. I have my sites running on some 40-50 $ yearly, and you can find it if you try. Be suspicious and demanding. Don’t fall for the trick that it is important to put a lot of money into the design; best design on lousy server is a waste of money. Best design with lousy product/service – also. I mean, look at reddit, is that a design? But millions of happy people are here every day. Content rocks, no matter what marketing gurus tell you.
9.	I didn’t mention domain picking process: whatever you do guys – be short, for god’s sake. Domain with more than 10-12 letters is already sucking, and the essence of your domain is not only the name of your business, but also your niche. Combine that in 7-12 letters (or less) and you are good. Also, com, org, net and other discussions last as long as the internet – basically they are all the same.
10.	My last point will be this: trust the experts, but be very careful. Today, almost anyone is expert for fb advertising, SEO (search engine optimization) or web design. Usually, big promises and chosen words (keywords, hehe) lead nowhere; you don't want to spend huge amounts of that green stuff (they call it money) in vain. Best cure for that is: YOU know your company, your venture, therefore you must know your target market, and you are supposed to ask yourself a million questions about your business strategies. Know that internet is not a magic wand – things are far more complicated than you think. At the core of all designs, SEO and keywords, marketing tricks,  there is a – good product or a service. Best marketing always – word from mouth to mouth. And hardest to achieve.
11.	One more – website has to be frequently updated. Never lose control of it, meaning, don't hire a fancy company to make changes, and pay endlessly for each change. You know, guys that cover things with their fancy professional slang. If you solve this one, after you managed to set up other things mentioned here – then you are on the net. That is the day you start, really...

I plan on documenting the process and making internet videos on the process so other entrepreneurs in other parts of the country can learn how to do this.

Update: 

I live in Alaska which make internet shopping a way of life but if I can print for local crafters they will be able to order more items while cutting down on shipping costs.  Tourism is big up here and a lot of local crafters make items on the side to sell off and make some money.  So I'm not expecting to have bulk orders for stuff but will be getting orders of like 3 to 10 items at a time.  This can save local crafters time as they don't have to carve the stuff themselves and they will be able to focus on the finishing touches.

For those of who are wondering on the legalities of printing firearms stuff my state has very lax gun manufacturing laws and the main laws that are of concern are the federal ones.  I plan on printing firearms accessories like custom pistol grips.  For those who would be interested in actually printing federally regulated stuff you can lease the machine time to the person and sell them the material to make the part.  You will need a class 3 firearms license in order to manufacture firearms for sell.  There is also multiple types of licenses once you get to class 3 so you will need to do your research in order to go this route.  I don't plan on doing this unless I get a very strong interest after the initial set-up.  It cost a couple thousands of dollars just to apply and more to insure your location complies with the requirements to have the license.

Thank you guys for your input on what you think of this endeavor.",,False,self,t5_2qldo,1368053544.0,,,True,t3_1dx2x9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1dx2x9/setting_up_a_small_3d_printing_business_any_thing/,

What should I do to differentiate myself from the competition?,Goodguyscumbag,31,9,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1dryms/going_to_start_a_junk_hauling_business_i_have_a/,"Well, the basis of junk hauling is you have crap in your house that you don't want, it may be too heavy for you to lift or something like that, or a huge job that you just don't want to do. So the junk haulers load it into their truck and get rid of it for a fee.

Well, my first instinct was to compete on price, and I read from multiple sources that that is a huge no no for junk hauling.

I can't think of too many ways to compete with the national companies or even the smaller guys. It seems like I would need to do something different or better to compete, but I don't know how to add to lifting a stove out of someones house and taking it to the recycling center. It seems like if you do it correctly there is no real way to stand out.",,False,self,t5_2qldo,False,,,True,t3_1dryms,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1dryms/going_to_start_a_junk_hauling_business_i_have_a/,
