1375639655.0,275,self.cscareerquestions,1jov24,Here's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews,RunninADorito,307,32,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/,"Almost all of the questions posted in this sub are some form of ""what do I have to know/do to pass a tech interview/get a job.""  Here's some distilled advice I can offer from having conducted over 1000 tech interviews.  This doesn't cover everything, but I think it covers the most important foundational elements.


Setting expectations:  If this is your first time looking for a job, or you haven't had to interview in a number of years, expect to invest some effort in preparing for the interview.  It's usually the industry professionals that completely ignore this step, but some college students do as well.  You're essentially studying for a test, don't slack off - it's going to be work.  All of those things that you've been telling yourself don't matter (maybe you're a bit fuzzy on how exactly the internet works - do you really know what happens after you hit enter on the URL bar?) that you don't know - now it's time to address those gaps head on.  So, what matter.


For the sake of space, I'm going to focus on what a fresh grad needs to do to prepare and that's more consistent across companies (and it's a shorter list).




**Data Structures**

Go to wikipedia and read the whole page of each of these a few times, then write your own (for real, actually write the code and play with this stuff - that is the most important part)

* Array
* Linked List
* Stack/Queue
* Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.  Learn as many as you can)
* Heap
* Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
* Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
* Trie (pronounced ""tree"")
* Linked Hash Map (this is very specific, but comes up a LOT in interviews)

You should know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each of these.  Know how the mechanics work.  It isn't a good interview questions, but you should be able to code every single one of these.  Then, prepare real-world examples of when you'd want to use each of these and explain why it's the best choice.  Data Structures come up in technical interviews in two way.  The first is in coding questions where you're expected to use the right one at the right time.  The second is on a comparison question - not connected to code - ""why would you use X over Y in situation Z.""




**Algorithms**

Again, make sure you actually code these for real when practicing.  Simply reading code someone else wrote will not cut it.  Open up your favorite IDE and start typing.  This is critical because often times you actually have a gap in your knowledge, but your scumbag brain convinces you it's ok (this happens without you even realizing it).  The only way to find these gaps is by writing code.  Know all of the Big-O for this and how it's derived.

You don't have to go crazy here, but review a couple of:

* Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
* Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
* Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space.  Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
* All the prefix-tree searches




Great, you're about 60% done now.  Now you need to practice applying this knowledge.  Find a source of interview questions (random websites, glassdoor.com, cracking the coding interview, etc.)  Code answers to those questions.  I strongly recommend forcing yourself to pretend you're in an interview setting.  Most of these questions should be solvable in ~10-15 minutes, some will be more like 20-25.  Time yourself.  Before you write a single line of code, organize your thoughts and figure out the entire solution, then start coding.  The coding part should be boring and straightforward.  In the actual interview, do the same thing.  Before you write a single line of code, make sure that you validate with the interviewer that your approach is a good one.  Practice practice practice this stuff.




**Fill Gaps**

This is where you get to be honest with yourself.  That long list of things you don't know that you keep telling yourself is ok because the stuff you don't know isn't actually important....well, it is.  Even if it isn't, your interviewer might think it is and it's better to have a job than be right.  Here's a list off the top of my head that I hear people say isn't important (but you really should know).

* Writing code - (I put this here half as a joke.  I can't tell you how many people with 15+ years of experience lose their mind when I ask them tow write some code with me.  These ""architects"" do not end up getting jobs.  Same goes for managers and other support positions.  I know that you're not going to write production code, that's fine - you should be able to write some code, though.) 
* Bits and Bytes - Yes, you should understand how all that bitshifting stuff works in whatever language you're going to interview with.  You should know what big and little endian are.  Do a couple practice questions, even simple one.  Try something like...""write a method to determine if the bit-wise representation of an integer is a palindrome.""
* How the internet works.  This applies more to companies....yeah....it applies to everything these days.  You should know how sockets work, you should know what TCP/IP is.  You should know what HTTP actually is.  Learn your networking layers and what's responsible for what  You don't need to know all of the details of the protocols, but you should know some of them and that they exist.  This sounds daunting, it should only take a couple of hours.
* Databases.  Learn some basic SQL and data modeling if the job you're applying for uses databases.
* Learn a bit about testing.  Write some code and test it.  What's TDD
* If you've only ever used Windows....consider using linux for a bit.
* Whatever else you can think of.  A good mental exercise is to imagine yourself in an interview...""man, I hope they don't ask me about X.""  Figure out what X is and read about it.


The good news is, the things on this list usually are far easier to learn than you think they will be.  These are usually scars from undergrad or gaps from a non-traditional route to CS that sound hard.  They're all easier to tackle than you think.



**Behavioral**

Alright, almost done.  Tech interviews aren't all about tech (they mostly are these days, but not completely).  You need to come across as someone people want to work with.  Smile, be energetic, be excited about the company, know what they do, have ideas about what they could be doing.  You're almost certainly going to encounter some behavioral interview questions.  You can prepare for these.  I suggest coming up with 3 situations where you were working on a tech project and things went well, and 3 stories for when things didn't go well.  Then practice telling the stories, make sure to include some setup information, what was the setting, what was the project, who was working with you, what was your role...then tell the story....then for the positive stories talk about the impact of your work, did you win, save the company money, what?  For the negative stories, finish up by talking about what you learned and how you'd approach the problem differently in the future.



**Parting Words**

Get a good nights sleep and do the best you can.  Expect to fail at some of these interviews, that's ok, treat it as a learning experience and recognize that there are both good and bad interviewers.  It's possible for a terrific candidate to get thrown to a bunch of shitty interviewers and not end up with a job (happens more than people like to talk about).  That isn't to say that you should use this as an excuse to not learn from the experience, but interviewing is a game.  Don't try and fight the rules or think it's stupid.  It is what it is and that's what's standing between you and the job you want.  Learn to play the game and win by practicing :-)


Best of luck, sorry for the typos.  For the people just getting started, you aren't a fraud, we all know how little fresh college grads know, we factor that in to the ramp-up process.  Be prepared to work hard.


**Edit:**
I'm just going to put some more things as I think of them down here.  I didn't think people would find this information so useful. 


**Don't Sell Past the Close**
To all you extroverts out there, I can't tell you how many times someone's been just a bit too honest.  When I'm interviewing you, I'm your best friend.  My goal is to get you as relaxed as possible for a couple of reasons.  First (and really the main motivating factor in choosing to be nice), your performance is best reflected when you're relaxed.  Freaking people out is expensive because some awesome engineers just freeze up when overly stressed in interviews (I've also found little correlation between interviewing-stress-paralysis and real-world-fire-drill-paralysis).  I'm nice because I don't want to exclude certain types of introverts from the hiring pool.  The other reason I'm nice is because extroverted people think we're friends.  We aren't friends, I'm interviewing you.


I don't care how much you think you're clicking with your interviewer.  He's invited you on his boat already, etc.  You aren't friends, so don't run your mouth.


It's human nature to want to form bonds with people and one way we make friends with people is by doing this elaborate dance of sharing secrets with people.  Early on there's a tendency to share some extra truths, usually fairly mild, but in an interview setting - bad idea.  Things I've heard:


""Yeah, I know it sounds impressive.  But hey, between you and me, I only really had to work 5-6 hours a day to get it done.""


""I know I'm not supposed to say this in an interview, but the real problem was my co-worker.  He was such a stickler for the littler details we could never get any code pushed out.""  (Actually anything that would start with ""I know I'm not supposed to say/talk about this in an interview - just avoid that).


Don't over-share.  If you think something is going to make you look bad, it probably will.


Exceptions to this rule:  There are a few things that people think are bad which are perfectly fine:
* Admitting you don't know something (better than making stuff up)
* Asking questions to make sure you understand the problem
* Saying that you're a bit nervous and want to take a couple seconds to compose yourself (totally fine, don't be overly dramatic about it, though)


You can be friends with the interviewers you like after you get hired.  Don't give people reasons not to hire you for free.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,1375657542.0,,,True,t3_1jov24,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/,

Have you ever had a conversation with a fellow technologist that you felt wasn’t quite at your skill level, and at some point you discovered that she/he makes $20,000 more than you do?  $50,000?  As someone who has had a great deal of access to the salary and compensation details for thousands of software engineers over many years, I can report that there can be significant variation in salary between technologists with almost indistinguishable skills and qualifications.  This may not be news to some, but some of the reasons might not be obvious to professionals in the field, particularly if someone has only been exposed to a small subset of industries or companies.  Many of the explanations are somewhat unique to this industry or at the very least more prevalent in the software world.  Regardless of whether or not money is a primary motivator in your career, it is still useful to understand why others may be earning more (and what you can do to earn more).

***What are some possible explanations as to why someone equally or less-qualified makes more money?***

* **Public image and intangibles** - An average technologist may be compensated above more productive co-workers if there is some advantage that the company sees in that person’s employment.  Community influencers such as open source project leads, conference organizers, meetup/user group leaders, speakers, and authors may all fall into this category.  In business this is the concept of goodwill, where an asset has a higher value due to an intangible.  Google’s high profile hires of  James Gosling and Ray Kurzweil and Dropbox’s hiring of Guido van Rossum came with a certain level of goodwill bundled.  On a local level, a company may believe that hiring the local Python group leader could make hiring Python pros easier and less expensive, which may justify a higher salary independent of the developer’s quality or production.  Regulars on the conference speaker circuit can ask for a premium simply based on the PR provided every time their bio is published on an event website.
* **Negotiations and raises** - Software professionals are often stereotyped as unskilled or uncomfortable in situations where they are negotiating or asking for raises and perks.  This first requires the courage to ask for more (as a raise or starting as a new hire), and then the knowledge and skill to ask effectively.  As a recruiter I typically handle salary discussions for my candidates, and I know that for most engineers that particular service is considered most valuable.  A difference of even a few thousand dollars as a starting salary can dramatically alter your lifelong earnings.  Remember that this number is regularly used as the basis for bonuses, raises, and most importantly it has some bearing on salary at your next job.  Think of starting salary as the principal level for compound interest.
* **Market knowledge** - Remember that conversation alluded to in the first line of this article?  If you had three or four similar interactions within a year, hopefully you noticed a pattern and it seems your friends know something that you don’t.  Many engineers aren’t even aware that they are paid below market rate because they just trust that they are fairly compensated and have no reason to investigate further.  I have had conversations with experienced and well-qualified developers who are floored when they learn that they have been paid 20-30% below market rate for many years.  Know what you are worth.
* **Self-promotion** - Even if the high skill level is there, many technologists are either unable to properly express their own expertise and accomplishments or feel awkward tooting their own horn.  The ability to market yourself often starts with a powerful résumé and a confident interview presence when trying to maximize salary at a new job.  When staying with your employer, self-promotion requires the savvy to make your accomplishments known without looking like a braggart.
* **Consulting differential** (both independent and staff) - Developers that are independent consultants charge clients a premium to account for expected frictional unemployment and to address the fact that a temporary employer typically will not make any real investment in the career of a temporary employee.  It is rare to see independent consultants sent to conferences or trainings by their clients, and independents do not always get the most desired projects.  Independents are also on the hook for their own benefits, retirement savings, etc.  Salaried employees of consulting firms are also often paid above other similarly qualified professionals, as it is easy to measure a consultant’s contribution to the firm’s net revenues based on bill rates, billable hours, and their compensation package.  There may also be regular travel or variable commute that tends to inflate salaries.  Salaried consultants who know their bill rate, utilization, and total compensation package have a distinct advantage when trying to justify their value (and salary) to an organization.
* **Profit vs Cost Centers** - Similar to consulting, companies that use technology as their main source of revenue tend to pay higher than firms where it is considered a cost center.  Building software products that will be sold usually results in higher salaries than building systems for internal use.  There are some major exceptions, but those tend to be specialized to industries where technology utilization is a key differentiator in the performance of the firm’s primary business interests (trading systems come to mind).
* **Rare skill** - The premium paid for even one single rare skill among many common skills can be substantial.  When a new language, framework, product, or platform is hyped as the ‘next big thing’ and adoption begins, even junior level talent with that skill can earn above more generally qualified individuals.  This is simple supply and demand for a scarce resource.  In years past the premium was greater for rare skills, as companies today seem more confident in their ability to train an existing resource than to hire someone new and much more expensive.
* **Time expectations** – Some employers pay a premium because of the high expectations they place on hires.  Unless you have some vested interest in the success of the company (stock, profit sharing), a 70 hour work week is probably unacceptable unless you are being compensated accordingly for that level of commitment.  Positions that require employees to be on-call are also commonly paid above market.  Work/life balance has a price, and some are willing to sell.
* **Long tenures at big companies** – Many large organizations have systems of pre-determined fixed raises and regular bonus or vacation increases for certain milestones.  The hire’s value to the company increases over time as they become highly specialized in a certain environment, and the concept of golden handcuffs is born.  The downside of this for the employee is that it often leads to compensation well above true market rates, which makes it nearly impossible to find new employment at a lateral compensation rate.  When these types are victims of a layoff, the result is brutal.
* Location – No explanation needed, I hope.

***Conversely, here are a couple explanations as to why someone might make less.***

* **Startups** – Startups often exchange equity for cash compensation.  These employees are often earning less for the opportunity to receive a big payout.  Candidates negotiating with startups must place their own figures on the value of the equity, which is a difficult task.  Startup compensation today is much more competitive with large companies than it once was, at least in my experience.
* **Benefits, work/life balance** - Since most professionals refer to compensation in terms of cash paid, employees that receive significant value in their benefits and perks may be mistakenly considered underpaid.  Generous paid time-off, tuition reimbursement, and childcare can be major expenses that are covered by some employers and often not included in discussions. 
* **Experience value** – The opportunity to work for certain companies, to learn a valuable skill, or to be on a highly-regarded team is a reason that many engineers may sacrifice some salary, and shops that provide that ability may leverage that during negotiations.  Many developers are entirely comfortable with accepting compensation below market as a trade-off for the positive effect on their career and marketability.

**Conclusion:**

If the topic of compensation comes up with other technologists, consider that there may be several explanations and hidden factors for the disparity between numbers.  When exploring new opportunities, keep in mind that the amount of your offer is not solely based on your skill level relative to others or the value the company feels you will provide.  In situations where several of these explanations apply simultaneously, the numbers become even more skewed.

1362160577.0,125,self.cscareerquestions,19h2bm,A Guide To Lifelong Employability For Tech Pros,fecak,144,19,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19h2bm/a_guide_to_lifelong_employability_for_tech_pros/,"There seem to be a rash of *“Am I Unemployable?”* posts and comments lately on sites that I frequent, and after reading details the answer in my head is usually *“Not quite, but sounds like you are getting there.""*  In other words, someone *will hire you* for something, but many who assess themselves as unemployable are going to feel both underpaid and undervalued when they finally find work.

How does a technology professional go from being consistently and happily employed for a number of years, only to find himself/herself suddenly unemployable?  Better yet, what are the key differences between someone who spends months on a job search and someone who can unexpectedly lose a job Friday and start a new one the following Monday?

**How do certain people get job offers without having to even interview?**

It isn’t simply about skill, although that is obviously a factor.  Even pros that are highly productive and well-regarded in some circles can encounter challenges in today’s hiring environment.  It’s about creating relationships and developing your reputation/visibility.

In my experience, pros that are always in demand and rarely (if ever) unemployed seem to share certain sets of habits, and while some of the material below is Career 101 there are some that you probably never considered.  As a longtime user group leader and recruiter of software engineers for the past 15 years, I see this first hand on a daily basis.  Let’s start with the habits that are the least obvious and progress to some that are more widely practiced.

* **Interview** - How often do you interview when you are not actively looking for a job?  For most the answer is never, and I’d encourage you to take at least a couple interviews a year.  Going on the occasional interview can serve two purposes.  First, they are a way to make new contacts and keep your name in the minds of potential employers, with the added benefit that these same interviewers may be working at new companies in a year or two.  One interview could lead to an ‘in’ with four or five companies down the road.  Second, it is the only way to keep interview skills sharp.  Interview practice is best done live without a net, and failing the audition for a job you truly wanted is often attributed to rusty interview chops.  Even a simple informational interview request (made by you) is an effective and creative way to make first contact with a potential employer.

* **Know when to leave your job** – Without question, the group having the toughest time finding work are unemployed with say ten+ years at the same company, and a close second would be employed workers with that same ten year tenure.  For anyone about to scream ‘ageism‘ please hold that thought, as older technologists that have made smart moves do not typically have this issue.  I would add that older engineers who possess the habits outlined here are the group being hired without interviews.  There are always exceptions, but tech pros can stagnate quicker than those in other industries due to the speed of change in technology.
The definition of job hopping has morphed over the past fifteen years, and it is now understood that semi-regular movement is expected and accepted.  Where other industries may interpret multiple employers as a symptom of disloyalty, in the software world a pattern of positive (moving to something better) job changes is often more indicative of a highly desirable candidate.  Conversely, someone who has remained at a company for many years may be viewed by employers as loyal to a fault and potentially unambitious.  If this person has solid skills, why has no company picked him/her up yet?  Changing jobs before stagnating is critical to overall employability, and how quickly you stagnate will vary based primarily on your employer’s choices, your own ability to recognize that stagnation is happening, and your desire to not let it happen.

* **Make ‘future marketability’ a primary criterion when choosing jobs or projects** – Carefully consider how a new position will impact your ability to find work later in your career and use that as one of your key incentives when evaluating opportunities.  Details about your roles and responsibilities as well as the company’s technology choices and reputation in the industry are all potential factors.  Does the company tend to use proprietary languages and frameworks that will not be useful later in your career?  How will this look on my résumé?  Many candidates today are choosing jobs or projects based on an opportunity to learn a new skill, and for this they are usually willing to sacrifice some other criteria.

* **Reach out to others in the community (not coworkers)** – How many times have you sent an unsolicited email to someone in your field that you don’t know?  “Congrats on your new release, product looks great!” or “Saw that you open sourced, look forward to checking it out” as an email or a tweet is an effective way to create a positive impression with a person or organization.  Twitter is great as a public acknowledgment tool, and the character limit can actually be advantageous (no babbling).  If you stumble on an article about a local company doing something interesting, there is much to be gained by a 140 character pat on the back. This is essentially networking without the investment of time.

* **Lunch with others (again, not coworkers)** – You have to eat lunch anyway, so how about inviting someone you don’t know that well to lunch?  Perhaps include a few people that share some common technology interest and turn it into a small roundtable discussion.  Meeting with other tech pros outside an interview or meetup environment enables everyone to let their guard down, which leads to honest discussions about the experience of working at a company that you may consider in the future.  It’s also an opportunity to learn about what technologies and tools are being used by other local shops.

* **Public speaking** – This is an effective way to get attention as an authority in a subject matter, even on a local level.  Preparing a presentation can be time consuming, but generally a wise investment.  Even speaking to a somewhat small group once a year can help build your reputation.

* **Attend a conference or group meeting** – This isn’t to be confused with going to every single meeting for every group in your area.  Even getting to an event quarterly keeps you on the radar of others.  Make an appearance just to show your face and say hi to a few people.

* **Reading and writing about technology** – One could debate whether reading or writing has more value, but some combination of the two is likely the best formula.  If you don’t know what to read, follow some peers and a few respected pros from your field on Twitter, LinkedIn or Google+, and make a point to read at least a few hours a week.  As for writing, even just making comments and discussing articles has some value, with perhaps more value (for job hunting purposes) in places like Stack Overflow or Hacker News where your comments are scored and can be quantified.  Creating your own body of written work should improve your understanding of a topic, demonstrate your ability to articulate that topic, and heighten your standing within the community.

* **Build a personal code repo** – Many in the industry balk at this due to the time required, but having some code portfolio seems to be on the rise as an expectation hiring firms have for many senior level candidates.  If the code you wrote at work is not available for demonstration during interviews, working on a personal project is more critical.

**Conclusion**
At first glance, this list may appear overwhelming, and I’m certain some readers will point to time constraints and the fact that they are working 60 hour weeks already.  Some of these recommendations take considerable time, but at least a few require very little commitment.  Employ a few of these tactics and hopefully you will never suffer through a prolonged job search again.

1362599923.0,110,self.cscareerquestions,19slv1,I recently got a job at Amazon. Here's what went down.,,120,10,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19slv1/i_recently_got_a_job_at_amazon_heres_what_went/,"As stated in the title, I recently (2ish weeks ago) accepted a job at Amazon.  I thought some of you might be interested in how that happened.  

In January, there was an event called CUSEC (Canadian Undergraduate Software Engineering Conference) held in Montreal.  This was a 3 day event that included presentations, coding competitions, speakers and a career fair.  At this career fair, I met recruiters from various companies (Microsoft, Morgan Stanley,..etc).  After briefly speaking with the Amazon recruiter, I was referred to one of the Amazon engineers also standing at the booth.  I spoke with the engineer for a few minutes, at the conclusion of which, he asked if I would like to do a small impromptu ""technical interview"".  The problem he gave me was mildly challenging and had both naive and optimized solutions. I gave both solutions and explained the differences between them.  After a few minutes of discussion, he took down my information and told me that Amazon would be in touch.

I didn't think much of it at the time.  The recruiters were seeing hundreds of people per day and, while I did think my solution was alright, it was nothing special.  Three weeks later, to my surprise, I received an email from another Amazon recruiter requesting that I attend an interview at their Seattle office.

I was pretty stunned.  After my brief encounter at the career fair, I thought that they MIGHT contact me for a phone interview but that would probably be it.  To be immediately asked to fly out to Seattle was a bit of a shock.  I confirmed that I would be attending and patiently awaited the date of my interview.

The interview itself was very coding heavy.  I can't really go into specifics but, by the end of the 5-6 hour interview, I was exhausted.  At that point, I honestly did not think very much of my performance.

Two days after returning home (on my birthday, no less) , I received and email stating that Amazon was going to extend me an offer. Again, I was stunned.  I have been rejected by a few other companies after having performed (in my opinion) much stronger interviews.  Long story short, I accepted the offer.

Now comes the part that might encourage some of you.  My GPA is nothing special.  I have a 3.1.  I do not have any interesting side projects to speak of.  However, I do have 2 short internships under my belt.  I hope this story helps, in any way possible, to those of you that will be soon graduating.  

tl;dr - 3.1 GPA dude with no side projects but some internships gets offered a job at Amazon

Over the course of my career I have scheduled thousands of software engineering interviews with hundreds of hiring managers at a wide array of companies and organizations.  I have learned that although no two managers look for the exact same set of technical skills or behaviors, there are recognizable patterns in the feedback I receive when a candidate is not presented with a job offer.

Obviously, if you are unable to demonstrate the basic fundamental skills for a position (for our purposes, software engineering expertise), anything else that happens during an interview is irrelevant.  For that technical skills assessment, you are generally on your own, as recruiters should not provide candidates with specific technical questions that they will be asked in an interview.

It should be helpful for job seekers to know where others have stumbled in interviews where technical skill was not the sole or even primary reason provided for the candidate’s rejection.  The examples of feedback below are things I have heard repeatedly over the years, and tend to be the leading non-technical causes of failed interviews in the software industry (IMO).

**Candidate has wide technical breadth but little depth** – The ‘jack of all trades’ response is not uncommon, particularly for folks that have perhaps bounced from job to job a little too much.  Having experience working in diverse technical environments is almost always a positive, but only if you are there long enough to take some deeper skills and experience away with you.  Companies will seek depth in at least some subset of your overall skill set.

**Candidate displayed a superiority complex or sense of entitlement** - This seems most common when a candidate will subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) express that they may be unwilling to do any tasks aside from new development, such as code maintenance, or when a candidate confesses an interest in exclusively working with a certain subset of technologies.  Candidates that are perceived as team players may mention preferences, but will also be careful to acknowledge their willingness to perform any relevant tasks that need to be done.

**Candidate showed a lack of passion** – The lack of passion comment has various applications.  Sometimes the candidate is perceived as apathetic about an opportunity or uninterested in the hiring company, or often it is described as what seems to be an overall apathy for the engineering profession (that software is not what they want to be doing).  Regardless of the source of apathy, this perception is hard to overcome.  If a candidate has no passion for the business, the technology, or the people, chances are the interview is a waste of time.

**Candidate talked more about the accomplishments of co-workers** – This piece of feedback seems to be going viral lately.  Candidates apparently ramble on about other groups that built pieces of their software product, QA, the devops team’s role, and everyone else in the company, yet they fail to dig deep into what their own contribution was.  This signifies to interviewers that perhaps this candidate is either the least productive member of the team or is simply unable to describe their own duties.  Give credit where it is due to your peers, but be sure to focus on your own accomplishments first.

**Candidate seems completely unaware of anything that happens beyond his/her desk** – Repeatedly using answers such as “I don’t know who built that” or “I’m not sure how that worked” can be an indicator that the candidate is insulated in his/her role, or doesn’t have the curiosity to learn what others are doing in their company.  As most engineering groups tend towards heavy collaboration these days, this lack of information will be a red flag for potential new employers.

**Candidate more focused on the tools/technology than on the profession** – Although rare, this often troubles managers a great deal, and it’s often a symptom of the ‘fanboy’ complex.  I first experienced this phenomenon when EJB first arrived on the scene in the Java world, and many candidates only wanted to work for companies that were using EJB. When a technologist is more focused on becoming great at a specific tool than becoming a great overall engineer, companies may show some reluctance.  This is a trend that I expect could grow as the number of language/platform choices expands, and as fanatical response and the overall level of polarization of the tech community around certain technologies increases.

**Candidate’s claimed/résumé experience ≠ candidate’s actual experience** – Embellishing the résumé is nothing new.  A blatant lie on a résumé is obviously a serious no-no, but even some minor exaggerations or vague inaccuracies can come back and bit you.  The most common example is when a candidate includes technologies or buzzwords on a résumé that they know nothing about.  Including items in a skills matrix that are not representative of your current skill set is seen as dishonest by hiring managers.

**Candidate’s experience is not ‘transferable’** – If your company is only using homegrown frameworks and proprietary software, or if you have worked in the same company for many years without any fundamental changes in the development environment, this could be you.  The interviewer in this case feels that you may be productive in your current environment, but when given a different set of tools, methodologies, and team members, the candidate may encounter too steep a learning curve.  This is often a response on candidates that have worked within development groups at very large companies for many years.

Give some thought to these before your next interview.  I’m always interested in comments if you have some other feedback that you have seen regularly.

**1. I have an offer for employment at $X, should I drop out?**   
For 99% of you: **NO** absolutely not. Your degree will be more valuable in the long run, and if/when you decide to switch companies it will be invaluable. Exceptions to this would include if you have financial hardship staying in your program **and** the salary wouldn't allow you to live and pay for school. You **can** work a full-time job and go to school, tons of people do it.   
**2. I have an offer from company X and am still waiting to hear from company Y, what should I do?**   
If you like both companies, or you would prefer Y: Tell Y you have an offer on the table, that will speed them up. You probably don't want to give them details on the offer until you know what they are planning on giving you.   
**3. My offer is $X, but I want $Y, what should I do?**   
First do research on median salaries in your area, you can use sites like [glassdoor.com](http://www.glassdoor.com) or [payscale.com](http://www.payscale.com) to figure that out. If your offer is significantly less than what you're seeing, you can probably ask for more, *typically* it seems about 10% more is ok, more than that may be pushing it. Use your best judgement.   
**4. Tips for handling recruiters:**   
Try not to tell them what you are looking for in a salary or what your previous salary was, this will usually limit you (They will press on this! Be prepared.) Another option is to provide a salary floor, ex: I'm not taking any jobs that pay less than $X. They also shouldn't need any information besides your resume, and they may conduct a short interview with you, if they ask for more than that it is probably sketchy! Use common sense and go with your gut.    
**5. Should I do this unpaid internship?**   
Almost always: **NO**, if you are in the U.S. unpaid internships are illegal. On top of that it only shows that the company doesn't value you or your work at all. Exceptions would be: If you aren't providing the company any value and are solely getting experience (then it would be legal, but it is incredibly difficult to justify this type of work in the CS field), or perhaps if your school has some sort of arrangement with local industry and unpaid internships have been normalized in your area **and** you can't find a better way of getting experience and getting paid for it!   
**6. I didn't find a summer internship, what should I do?**   
Find other avenues to keep practicing and building your skills. Open source projects, personal projects, 'pro-bono' work for student groups on campus that need tech solutions. There are a number of ways to get programming experience and build your skills that don't involve getting a paycheck from an established company. Be proactive in finding them and working them to your full advantage. Internships are still important, so start early in contacting recruiters for semester internship opportunities instead. But your world is not over if you don't get a summer internship. You just have to work harder to get that great summer experience. (thanks /u/catiebug)   
Many colleges have something going on during the summer you can help with. For example, this summer (and last summer) I'm working with my university's scientific programmers to write some analytic programs for the business school. I have friends doing research opportunities as well. Just network in your department and you're sure to find someone looking for extra help that will look good on a resume. (thanks /u/SummerInJapan)   
**7. My offer expires soon and I haven't heard back about negotiations, what should I do?**   
This is a tough situation. I would email the Recruiter to make sure it is documented. You want to make it clear that you're planning on taking the job, but you feel you'd like to discuss the compensation. Present your evidence (hopefully you have examples of others with similar backgrounds and levels of experience that received more from a similar company). Choose your wording carefully so they know that you're still considering the offer, but want to discuss this point further before you sign. If the Recruiter is not responding to your inquiries, it would not be right for the company to hold you to their deadline. (thanks again /u/catiebug !)
   
Please add anything else or criticize my answers and I'll try to keep the main post updated with feedback/new stuff! Or if you are a college student and have questions, please ask them here and I'll keep it updated with feedback!

Thanks for all of your encouragement. After being axed in March, I was offered a new job for over 50% more than my previous salary at an awesome, profitable company with flexible hours and a transparent, inclusive management style. I'm going to pay it forward by offering my thoughts on the incident.

Before:

* I ignored red flags. Lots of people left while I was there. One person had to leave because the company allegedly missed a deadline for filing his visa paperwork, then the management started to badmouth him. No explanation was offered for this or any management decision. Blame, fear, punishment and gossip seemed to be their main tools of leadership.

* Disliking my job made me reluctant to leave. Like an abusive relationship, I think that job was ultimately harder to leave than others because it made me feel like there was something wrong with me.  

* The company was performing poorly overall. The company's valuation slid 30% in the week after I was let go. Three months afterwards, two C-level executives, including the CEO, were replaced. 

After:

* I set my alarm every morning and got fully dressed as if I was going to work.*

How serious can they be when they say ""You'll never work again!""?",mintdilly,61,9,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jt6ka/terrible_experience_with_a_recruiter_how_serious/,"So, long story short, was on a contract to hire, company came in very low on salary, got a call from a recruiting firm I've never heard of talking about a position that paid a significant amount more. Had one phone interview with their client and they loved me, wanted to bring me on board. Went in at met them, seemed decent enough, told them I'd like to start. 


So, they insist that I start in EXACTLY two weeks, no more. I'm working on a BRAND new project in my current role, and I have two interns until the 16th, so I told them I'd like to stay here until the 16th, which would have been three weeks. Absolutely not. ""The client doesn't want to push the project back another week"". I end up having this back and forth three times with three different people at the recruiting firm. So, I'm in a moral quandary; do I not accept this position and just stay at the current employer until I can find something else or do I screw my current employer (which honestly has been GREAT, close to perfect) and just take the job with the new place on the date they insist on?

I actually choose option C: get on the phone with a buddy of mine and get hired at a THIRD job the same day.

So, anyway, I emailed the recruiters yesterday, told them ""hey thanks, but I can't start on that day, and I don't want to work anywhere where they won't allow me to gracefully leave a current employer. Good luck with the search.""

My phone instantly started ringing off the hook.

Long and the short of it: talked to some director this morning, he told me that he never asked the client about the start date, and if they knew it was a big deal, they would have made it happen. I told them that I don't like being lied to, and I'm not coming to work there.

He lays into me: you're lazy, you're a child, you're not acting professional, you'll never work again.

I mean...I'll clearly work again, I can get a job almost at will. But can this unstable fellow actually DO anything? I mean, outside his scumbag company?

tl;dr:
Didn't start new position; couldn't agree on start date. Butthurt recruiter tells me I'm a child that will never work again.

So, this morning, another recruiter from another company contacted me about the SAME position. HA!",,False,,t5_2sdpm,1375975349.0,,,True,t3_1jt6ka,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jt6ka/terrible_experience_with_a_recruiter_how_serious/,
1373307279.0,51,self.cscareerquestions,1hvmwn,I failed an easy technical interview,mr_littlejeans,58,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hvmwn/i_failed_an_easy_technical_interview/,"
I failed an easy technical interview. This fact wouldn’t hurt so much if I was a
junior programmer just out of school, but I am in my early forties and have been
programming for 13 years. I am a senior developer at a large website, where I
have worked for the past 10 years. It has been nearly that long since my last
interview. I have been a manager for the past few years, and have probably spent
more time with management tasks in that time that I have with programming. Not
long ago, I came to the conclusion that I would rather continue my career as a
programmer than in management.

The interview was held over Skype, and was a TDD exercise. It was also a sort of
exercise in pair programming. The interviewer wrote the code, whereas I was to
inform him what to write. The goal was to create a Set class (and yes, I knew
what a set was going into the interview, which of course was the first
question).  What stumped me, it turned out, was the whole pivot from failing
test to working code thing. Yes, I know it sounds bad. How difficult could it be
to write *failing* test code???  But for some damned reason, during the
interview, I was just stumped (as an aside and maybe in my defense I will
mention that we don’t practice TDD where I work - we write tests but most
programmers only do so after some draft of the code has been created - not
line-by-line using the fail-fix-fail workflow recommended - I know it’s bad, but
we just don’t do it). We would write a bit of code, and then he would stop and
quickly ask, “OK, what next?”, and in the heat of the moment I just had no
fricking clue what to do next. Deer in the headlights. What is perhaps most
frightening is that I left the interview thinking I did well. I knew I stumbled
in parts, but I had no idea what my mistakes at cost me.

The recruiter was kind enough to gather feedback and follow-up with me the
following week. They said I was “smart,had good communication skills”, but that
I answered too slowly, and was “too passive”. And lastly, (and worst of all to
me) - something to the effect that perhaps I was most well suited to an
enterprise level organization (like where I am currently employed) rather than a
start-up that will likely only have two or three devs (they are not really a
start-up, but a large corporation that is trying to create a new product with a
start-up like environment). This translates to me like “You are not smart enough
to work at a start-up, stay with the enterprise company where all the slow kids
work”. I am willing to concede that some of this may be true. Perhaps I am too
slow to work at a start-up. In general - not just in programming, but in life in
general, I am not a speedy sort of fella. I do everything slow. I eat slow. I
walk slow. And yes, I suppose I often think slow. The upside of this is that I
have near infinite patience. I actually enjoy sitting in airports because I
appreciate the limbo-time to do absolutely nothing, to let my thoughts wander,
to watch people, to read a book.  My natural state is to be more meditative and
contemplative - rather than goal-oriented, GTD - to be always “crushing it!”.
More Ent that Elf.

And so my question to you, Reddit, is what I am to take away from this? Do I
embrace what my limitations are and seek to eke out a life for myself as a
programmer that befits my plodding, daydreaming nature (avoid start-ups), or do
I refuse to  allow such possibly-hasty judgements to define me and seek out ways
to improve what are perhaps not immutable weaknesses?

This is an update about the interview.  

First, the two obvious questions:  

* Why do you want to work at Twitter?
* If we did hire you, what would you do to improve Twitter? Or what do you want to work on?

After those, the interviewer moved to the coding part. He used [CollabEdit](http://collabedit.com/).  
He only asked one question. Here is the problem statement:  
&gt; You work for Twitter and you have some historical data about user login sessions. The data contains: a SessionID which can be assumed to be an integer, a UNIX time-stamp of the time a user logged in (session start time), and another UNIX time-stamp of when the user logged out (session end time).  
Given a timestamp t, how would you find out the total number of users logged in at that time?

To this, I gave the completely naive approach of scanning through the data and incrementing a counter if (loginTime &lt;= t &lt; logoutTime). Running time O(n).

The followup to this was:  
&gt; What if we want to do this repeatedly? How would you improve for efficiency?

Cue long discussion. Lots of back and forth where I gave a solution and the interviewer either approved, gave me a hint, pointed a bug, or asked another followup.

Overall, the interview didn't go as well as I would have liked, but the experience was *amazing*. Throughout the interview, I could tell that they just wanted to see how I approach a problem, and how I think. If I got stuck, the interviewer gave me hints to point me in the right direction.  
I'm no authority on this, but I strongly feel that this is how interviews *should* be conducted.

I come from a poor background. In my home town, no one goes to college. Many don't even finish high school because such things have no credence; anyone can get a job in town (as a construction guy, contractor, or gas station attendant) without a high school diploma. I left high school at 16 to work concrete. College just doesn't entire into these people's minds as a possibility. The culture is very anti-intellectual as well. 

I've always liked math and science a lot. I was always described by teachers as a ""gifted"" student in these areas, and I always try to deeply analyze how things work. Eventually I got a PC. Rather than simply say ""that there be one of them magic boxes"" and stab at the power button with my chicken grease covered digits, I tried to figure out how this incredible machine worked. 

I had no idea how a computer worked, but I started to form certain concepts in my mind about how I thought it worked after a while. I knew it wasn't ""magic""; it was a machine. Electricity flowed through it. I had so many ideas (and later on I learned the academic definition for what I was thinking of: finite state machine) and I started going to libraries, old high schools, etc. to find books on electricity, circuits, and anything else remotely related to computers. I learned a lot about capacitors, transistors, cathodes, etc. but never really figured out the operating system part.

Eventually, dial-up internet was brought to my neck of the woods, and man, was I ever fascinated by that. Every spare moment I'd be trying to learn something new on there. I figured out that I was an intelligent person and felt my mind was being wasted stripping roofs and digging holes in the ground. I started to come across the term ""computer programmer"", but I had no idea what that meant, but I very badly wanted to find out. The colors on the screen, the mouse movements, the start-up/shut-down functions, I knew it was all simply the very rapid interaction of hardware, electricity, and something else...which turned out to be code. I read books on C, but was never able to program in it because I had Windows and could not download Linux or BSD on dial-up.

I ended up getting my GED in 2005. I was 22 years old. I applied to the local state college and to my astonishment I was accepted. This is not a very good school at all, and I knew that, but it was better than nothing (at least that's what I thought). I had a big problem though: school costs mucho pesos, which I did not have.

Going to college meant moving into the ""city"" part of the county, so I applied to every job in town. One of these jobs was in a big warehouse so I applied to be a forklift selector. At the HR office, I did something that seemed to shock the HR people: I divided one number by another in my head (they lost the calculator so I just spit the answer out to help them). They asked how I did that, and I explained that division is easy for those numbers and you can just follow a step-by-step process (which I learned later was an ""algorithm"") for arriving at the answer or best approximation. 

The nice ladies of HR recommended me for this other job, in the warehouse offices. It was part data entry, part input-output (print and such), and some other stuff. The computer were all green-screen IBM terminals and the computer system was a mainframe. I'd never heard of one. I just knew I liked Windows better. This job paid like $10 an hour though so I was practically rich. 

I worked overnights and went to school during the day. I was even doing over-time and pulling 60+ hours per week. My life revolved around a series of naps, but I sure was learning a lot. I breezed through the first semester, mostly because I was just having such a blast in my intro to programming and math classes. They weren't hard, but I would read the entire book for a class in the first couple weeks, do all the practice problems, and do well.

I love the programming stuff the most. This was the answer I'd been looking for for a while. You take a language a person can read and create a basic set of instructions that the computer can compile, read, and execute. The logic just made so much sense. In the meantime, my job got moved to a new office because we got a new data center for the warehouse. Now we had Windows XP PCs to work from and everything. They also expanded the responsibilities of the job as the company updated it's technology. I became a helpdesk, network ops, Unix, and mainframe operator all rolled into one, still working full-time and going to school full-time.

As school went on, it got harder. Not unmanageable, but I was getting stressed doing both things full-time. I couldn't quit though, because without the job I couldn't pay for school, and they would throw me out and it would have all just been a waste. As I learned more about the company, I switched majors to Business. 

After three years, I got my Business degree. I took that straight to the HR department at my company. However, these were not the nice old ladies that had hired me. A new crop was put in place. These were young, pretty, and very mean girls. They came from schools like Cornell, and the company paid them top dollar to recruit from top schools in order to bolster the companies profits with top-tier graduates and their Ivy-League intellects. I was told that they don't hire low-tier scum like me and to get back to my till or leave. 

I felt awful. Before, I thought I'd made something out of myself. I really did, and everyone in my department pretty much was rooting for me to move on and become successful. I returned with my head hung low, realizing the caste system I was up against. I stuck around that job for another year or so but ultimately went back to my old habits of studying computer science and mathematics. I signed up at the college again to finish the degree I originally stated.

By that time, I was working second shift at my job and was effectively the lead/supervisor (although I was not being paid for this). I couldn't handle the upper-level classes and the job, so after a month of doing both I had to give my notice. The higher ups were infuriated that their lead was leaving and they had no one competent to replace me. I asked them how long it would take to train someone up to my level, to which they said they would need two years. I said I've given my required two-week notice (I actually gave them three) and I would happily work out my final time training someone else as best I could. They fired me on the spot. 

Unemployed, but now with a good chunk of change saved up, I put my full brain power to work on my final semester of CS. I learned all kinds of interesting stuff like linear algebra, number theory, self-balancing search trees, and cryptography. I started to like Java a lot and made that my main language. I learned everything I could about Java and the VM; whenever something presented itself that seemed like hocus pocus I just learned how it was working, like concurrent threading or how the VM does garbage collection, and what exactly happens to methods on the stack and objects on the memory heap at run time. 

Finally, I got the second degree (not too long ago), and here I am. That's my story. Here's my problem:

I feel like I'm in no better of a position to get a job other than gas pump monkey. Like I said before, this school isn't exactly MIT. Realistically, it's lower than whale shit on the the prestige scale for CS, and I'm still in that lower caste no matter how I rationalize it. I spent approx. $100,000 of my own hard-earned money earning those pieces of paper but I realize they are practically worthless. 

Every day, I get up and apply for jobs online. Sometimes I get a rejection notice, sometimes no reply. I've never gotten an interview. I know I'd make a great business systems analyst or software engineer. I worked along side so many of those Cornell graduates in my time at my company, and let me tell you, those people aren't smarter than me, and they don't do anything that I can't do. 

I see a lot of questions on here about the interview. I know I could impress people given the chance. I know CLRS by heart and have seen every video CS lecture Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT has every put on YouTube (I actually have them all saved on my laptop). It just seems like I can't get there from here. 

I typed out that long story because I feel like there are more people out there like me, just not on /r/cscareerquestions. So many people on this subreddit never had to work a day in their life, then got some internship and were offered high-paying jobs just like that. I'm at the point where I think I should just give up because it won't happen for me. I now live in a big city but I work for minimum wage because it's all I can get.  

Is there anything else I can do besides randomly apply to jobs on Dice? I already know the advice some of you are going to give, which is create some personal projects and/or create an app. Well, I don't want to make apps for a living, and there's no projects a person could possibly create that are going to impress people who work on multi-million dollar software projects with millions of SLOC. 

What do I do? Is this it for me? I went from nothing right back to nothing 7 years later.

I used to be a ""superstar"" - go off on a project, come back with great algorithms, design, really outperform. All along, I've loved it. From SQL to hand-assembly, I fucking *delight* in this stuff. I'd snort some stims, code like a demon, astound everyone. Not to sound arrogant, but I got a good rep in a certain sector.

Moved to a great new job with some people I know. Tore into it. Designed and delivered excellently for months. Got a top guy in, a good buddy, and now he's a division head. 

A year ago, like a circuit slowly corroding - I just couldn't. At first I was not as productive. Less flow time. Then less fun programming, less reading papers, even less enjoying Haskell. Even my most enjoyable stuff, reversing/cracking/crypto/hacking - can only rarely get me in the zone. When I do get in the zone, I'm as good as ever.

I just have no drive. I get up, and even roaring to add a neat little feature right then, as soon as I open my code, I'm immediately hit with a wave of... apathy and boredom, and I go do something else (Reddit, HN, read, TV, even go walking). 

I like the work I have. It's challenging fun, management lets me deal with technical stuff all I want, no BS. Perfect assignment.

I thought burnout, so I took a few days off with my family. No Internet, no tablets. Was great; within a day I had a ton more work ideas. Read novels for days. I felt I'd jump back in fully charged... and went right back into the rut.

My work life should be great, but it's a farcical living prison and I'm lying to everyone I know. Eventually I'll be discovered, fired, be broke and my rep shot.

I sometimes wish something terrible would happen, so I'd have a legitimate excuse and this stress would go away. (BTW, I've gone to doctors. All of the them give me zombification drugs. I can already be a zombie, without the drug side effects, so no help there.)

Please, does anyone know what might be going on? How can I get my mind back? Do you know of other people that just burned out forever?

1. Learn anything you need to learn to be able to do the projects below. Look them over before just jumping in, or this will just be frustrating. 

2. Pick something that you're involved in or enjoy. A hobby, small organization, whatever. Make an informational app for either Android or iOS for that. Nothing complicated, just basic PR stuff, but expand on it as you like. 

3. Pick something else you enjoy, and this time stop and think for a while, what would you like to be able to do related to this that you currently can't? Write an app for Android or iOS that solves that problem.

Congratulations, you now are an experienced mobile developer with a body of work that you can use to market yourself. These are also great for talking to recruiters, because you can literally pull out your phone and say ""I made this because I was interested in this topic. Isn't it neat?""

4. Make yourself a website. I used wordpress because it was simple and I personally don't like doing web UI work. 

5. On your website, build a tool that's programming related, even if it's nothing innovative. A pastebin is what I'm working on right now. This will help get you into web programming. 

6. Repeat the above 2-3 times until you have a decent body of work on the website.

At least a handful of readers told me that they didn’t get the job because they didn’t even get the interview.

With a down economy, most of us have heard accounts of a job seeker sending out 100, 200, perhaps 300 résumés without getting even one response.  These anecdotes are often received by sympathetic ears who commiserate and then share their personal stories of a failed job search.  To anyone who has sent out large quantities of résumés without any response or interviews, I offer this advice:

    The complete lack of response is not due to the economy.  The lack of response is based on your résumé, your experience, or your résumé submission itself.

My intent here is to help and certainly not to offend, so if you are one of these people that has had a hard time finding new work, please view this as free advice mixed with a touch of tough love.  I have read far too many comments lately from struggling job seekers casting blame for their lack of success in the search (“it wasn’t a real job posting”, “the manager wasn’t a good judge of talent“, etc.), but now it’s time to take a look inward on how you can maximize your success.  I spoke to a person recently who had sent out over 100 résumés without getting more than two interviews, and I quickly discovered that the reasons for the failure were quite obvious to the trained eye (mine).  The economy isn’t great, but there are candidates being interviewed for the jobs you are applying for (most of them anyway), and it’s time to figure out why that interview isn’t being given to you.

If you apply for a job and don’t receive a response, there are only a few possibilities as to why that are within our control (please note the emphasis before commenting).  Generally the problem is

    a mistake made during the résumé submission itself,
    problems with the résumé, or
    your experience.

Qualified candidates that pay attention to these tips will see better results from their search efforts.
Your Résumé Submission

Résumés to jobs@blackholeofdeath – The problem here isn’t that your résumé or application was flawed, it’s just that nobody has read it.  Sending to hr@ or jobs@ addresses is never ideal, and your résumé may be funneled to a scoring system that scans it for certain buzzwords and rates it based on the absence, presence and frequency of these words.  HRbot apocalypse…
Solution – Do some research to see if you know anyone who works/worked at the company, even a friend of a friend, to submit the résumé.  Protip:  Chances are the internal employee may even get a referral bonus.  LinkedIn is a valuable tool for this.  Working with an agency recruiter will also help here, as recruiters are typically sending your information directly to internal HR or hiring managers.

Follow instructions – If the job posting asks that you send a cover letter, résumé, and salary requirements, this request serves two purposes.  First and most obviously, they actually want to see how well you write (cover letter), your experience (résumé), and the price tag (salary requirements).  Second, they want to see if you are able and willing to follow instructions.  Perhaps that is why the ad requested the documents in a specific format?  Some companies are now consciously making the application process even a bit more complicated, which serves as both a test of your attention to detail and to gauge whether applicants are interested enough to take an extra step.  Making it more difficult for candidates to apply should yield a qualified and engaged candidate pool, which is the desired result.
Solution – Carefully read what the manager/recruiter is seeking and be sure to follow the directions exactly.  Have a friend review your application before hitting send.

Spelling and grammar – Spelling errors are inexcusable on a résumé today.  Grammar is given much more leeway, but frequent grammatical errors are a killer.
Solution – Have a friend or colleague read it for you, as it is much more difficult to edit your own material (trust me).

Price tag – As you would expect, if you provide a salary requirement that is well above the listed (or unlisted) range, you will not get a response.  Conversely and counterintuitively, if you provide a salary requirement that is well below the range, you will also not get a response.  Huh?

Suppose you want to hire someone to put in a new kitchen, and you get three estimates.  The first is 25K, the second is 20K, and the third is 2K.  Which one are you going to choose?  It’s hard to tell, but I’m pretty sure you aren’t going to use the one that quoted you 2K.  Companies want to hire candidates that are aware of market value and priced accordingly, and anyone asking for amounts well above market will not get any attention.
Solution – Research the going rate for the job and be sure to manage your expectations based on market conditions.  Another strategy is trying to delay providing salary information until mutual interest is established.  If the company falls in love, the compensation expectation might hurt less.  There is some risk of wasting time in interviews if you do not provide information early in the process,  and most companies today will require the information before agreeing to an interview.

Canned application – By ‘canned’ I am referring to job seekers that are obviously cutting and pasting content from previous cover letters instead of taking the time to try and personalize the content.
Solution – Go to the hiring firm’s website and find something specific and unique that makes you want to work for that company.  Include that information in your submission.  If you are using a template and just filling in the blanks (“I read your job posting on _____ and I am really excited to learn that your company _____ is hiring a ______”), delete the template now.  If you aren’t willing to invest even a few minutes into the application process, why should the company invest any time learning about you?

Too eager – If I receive a résumé submission for a job posting and then get a second email from that candidate within 24 hours asking about the submission, I can be fairly sure that this is an omen.  If I get a call on my mobile immediately after receiving the application ‘just to make sure it came through‘, you might as well just have the Psycho music playing in the background.   Even if this candidate is qualified, there will probably be lots of hand-holding and coaching required to get this person hired.  Reasonably qualified candidates with realistic expectations and an understanding of business acumen don’t make this mistake.
Solution – Have patience while waiting for a response to your résumé, and be sure to give someone at least a couple/few days to respond.  If you are clearly qualified for a position, you will get a reply when your résumé hits the right desk.  Pestering or questioning the ability of those that are processing your application is a guarantee that you will not be called in.
Your Résumé

Your objective – If your objective states “Seeking a position as a Python developer in a stable corporate environment“, don’t expect a callback from the start-up company looking for a Ruby developer.  This applies even if you are qualified for the job!  Why doesn’t the company want to talk to you if you are qualified?  Because you clearly stated that you wanted to do something else.  If you put in writing that you are seeking a specific job, that information must closely resemble the job to which you are applying.
Solution - You may choose to have multiple copies of your résumé with multiple objectives, so you can customize the résumé to the job (just be sure to remember which one you used so you bring the correct résumé to the interview!).  As there may be a range of positions you are both qualified and willing to take, using a ‘Profile’ section that summarizes your skills instead of an ‘Objective’ is a safer alternative.

Spelling and grammar (again) – see above

tl;dr – To any non-geek readers, this means ‘too long; didn’t read‘.  To my geek readers, many of you are guilty of this.  I’ve written about this over and over again, but I still get seven page résumés from candidates.  I have witnessed hiring managers respond to long-winded résumés with such gems as ‘if her résumé is this long, imagine how verbose her code will be‘. (Even for non-Java candidates!  #rimshot)  Hiring managers for jobs that require writing skills or even verbal communication can be extremely critical of tl;dr résumés.
Solution – Keep it to two or three pages maximum.  If you can’t handle that, get professional help.

Buzzword bingo – This is a term that industry insiders use to refer to résumés that include a laundry list of acronyms and buzzwords.  The goal is to either catch the eye of an automated search robot (or human) designed to rate résumés based on certain words, or to insinuate that the candidate actually has all the listed skills.  Software engineers are probably more guilty of this than other professionals, as the inclusion of one particular skill can sometimes make the difference between your document being viewed by an actual human or not.  When candidates list far too many skills buzzwords than would be reasonably possible for one person to actually know, you can be sure the recruiter or manager will pass based on credibility concerns.
Solution – I advise candidates to limit the buzzwords on your résumé to technologies, tools, or concepts that you could discuss in an intelligent conversation.  If you would not be comfortable answering questions about it in an interview, leave it off.
Your Experience

Gaping holes – If you have had one or more extended period of unemployment, hiring managers and recruiters may simply decide to pass on you instead of asking about the reasons why.  Perhaps you took a sabbatical, went back to school full-time, or left on maternity leave.  Don’t assume that managers are going to play detective and figure out that the years associated with your Master’s degree correspond to the two year gap in employment.
Solution – Explain and justify any periods of unemployment on your résumé with as much clarity as possible without going into too many personal details.  Mentioning family leave is appropriate, but providing the medical diagnosis of your sick relative is not.

Job hopping – Some managers are very wary of candidates that have multiple employers over short periods of time.  In the software world it tends to be common to make moves a bit more frequently than in some other professions, but there comes a point where it’s one move too many and you may be viewed as a job hopper.  The fear of hiring a job hopper has several roots.  A manager may feel you are a low performer, a mercenary that always goes to the highest bidder, or that you may get bored after a short time and seek a new challenge.  Companies are unwilling to invest in hires that appear to be temporary.
Solution – If the moves were the result of mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, or a change in company direction, be sure to note these conditions somewhere in the résumé.  Never use what could be viewed as potential derogatory information in the explanation.  Clearly list if certain jobs were project/contract.

Listed experience is irrelevant/unrelated – This could be a symptom of simply being unqualified for the position, or it could be tied to an inability to detail what you actually do that is relevant to the listed job requirements.  I would suspect that most of the aforementioned people (that received no responses to 100 submission) probably fall into the unqualified category, as job seekers tend to feel overconfident about being a fit for a wider range of positions than is realistic.  Companies expect a very close fit during a buyer’s market, and are willing to open up their hiring standards a bit when the playing field starts to level.
Solution – Be sure to elaborate on all elements of your job that closely resemble the responsibilities listed in the posting.  Instead of wasting time filling out applications for jobs that are clearly well out of reach, spend that time researching jobs that are a better match for you.

You are overqualified – The term ‘overqualified’ seems to be overused by rejected applicants today, as there is no real stigma to the term.  It’s entirely comfortable for a candidate to say/think “I didn’t get the job because I possess more skills at a higher level than the employer was seeking“.  When a company is seeking an intermediate level engineer, it isn’t always because they want someone earlier in their career than a senior level engineer (although in some cases this could be true).  Rather, they want the intermediate level engineer because that is what their budget dictates or they expect that senior engineers would not be challenged by the role (and therefore would leave).  There are also situations where companies will not want to hire you because your experience is indicative that you will only be taking this job until something better comes along.  A CEO applying for a job as a toll collector will not be taken seriously.
Solution – Be sure that your résumé accurately represents your level of skill and experience.  Inflating your credentials or job titles will always work against you.
Conclusion

The time you spend on your job search is valuable, so be sure to use it wisely.  Invest additional effort on applications for jobs that you feel are a great fit, and go above and beyond to be sure your submission gets attention.  As a general rule of thumb, you want to be sure that whoever receives your résumé will get it into the hands of someone who has a similar job to the one you want, not just someone trained to look for buzzwords.  Employees that have similar experience will be the best judges of your fit.

So I had my lawyer take a look at the clause, and he agreed that it is ambiguous and suggested adding ""in connection with your employment"". The company refused, basically saying ""all other employees have signed this contract, we're not going to change it"".

They have said they are fine with the moonlighting, so long as it's not competing with them (which it won't be). However, the fact that some company could technically come forward and claim ownership of an unrelated million-dollar idea I happen to create one weekend while I am employed there kind of irks me.

Please forgive me for writing so much, but I am in need of some helpful advice.

I graduated from the university with a B.S degree in computer science in December of last year.

My school couldn't offer me any financial aid for the last year and I looked for a job to make up for that. I finally found one with the county, doing web development work. It didn't pay all that well but would offer me paid tuition for the rest of the time I was in school.

I've been working there for nearly a year an a half now and it's been nearly six months since I graduated. I was expecting a big pay bump when I came out of school with the degree, but instead I'm making a whopping $36K/year at my current salary level. 

Here's the major problem. I've politely complained about this a few times and in February, my boss told me that she'd get me a raise, and that all she had to do was talk to the county's human resources department. Now it's May and (you guessed it) I haven't gotten any sort of raise at all and as you all know $36K/year isn't all that great to live on.

Prior to this, I read the resume section of a book that was recommended here, called ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" and fixed my resume accordingly. Then I threw it on Dice and waited for calls to come in. Well, not just waited, I've also applied to every job that I seem suited for. Unfortunately, this seems to have completely backfired on me. I go some weeks getting a call every other day and then other weeks not getting any calls at all. The problem is that almost everyone who calls fits into three camps:

1. Has insane expectations and offers ""senior"" positions that I don't qualify for (I feel recruiters don't even read you resume before calling).
2. Are scammy companies with terrible reviews, with recruiters who hardly speak English. I just ignore these guys now, unless they say they're calling from some reputable company.
3. Only want me to work on contract for 3 - 6 months. These seem scary because your benefits don't start until a certain time and they don't give you enough information on the company.

A lot of time, staffing agencies will also contact me, have me take an online assessment and then never contact me again. Even though I have the print outs from their exams that state that I've scored anywhere from 85 - 90 percent on their tests. This is very frustrating because it just feels like a complete waste of time.

On top of this, I've also been noticing more and more that my attitude towards my work is changing, a lot of the things that seemed okay really bother me now. For example, it bothers me that my team is full ""business analysts"" that get paid a lot more than I do and all they do is give me work to do and then take credit for it. I feel completely unmotivated because of this, though I never show it.

Finally. I went back to school and started getting an M.S in computer science. Again, this was in hopes that it would boost my potential to get a decent job. It's not too bad and (thank God) my employer is paying for it. However, between full time work and classes at school, I don't really have time to do any side projects (or much of anything, for that matter) that might get me more exposure.

So anyway, my questions are:


1. What company can I come to get an entry level developer job? Is there any particular company that is a good launching point?
2. What do I have to do to get company to notice me? Should I focus on the M.S or side projects?
3. Will my resume be judged more harshly because I work for the county? I personally feel like everyone who works here is just here because they have seniority and because it's safe, (no offense) but most of the older people are not particularly good at what they do.
4. What's the best plan of attack to get out of my current situation?
5. Should I take contracting/contract to hire jobs?

**TL;DR**
1. I am a recent computer science graduate.

2. I have 1.5 years of web development experience working terrible and incredibly low paying job for my county/local government.

3. I can't find a decent job on my own (I have been applying to everything I can) and I feel recruiters are really bad at matching me to other positions. I feel like they don't even read my resume at all.

4. I'm not sure if finishing my M.S in CS or doing side projects is the better option for getting attention from companies.

I found coding to be fun, and it came naturally to me - whereas law has always been a struggle that's only occasionally tolerable.

Recently, I saw the AskReddit thread about learning programming, and I realized that I may be able to switch careers without having to pay for school (I have *a lot* of student loan debt).

Right now, my general plan is to: (1) learn programming by completing free courses online (I've already started at Codecademy), (2) create a portfolio of websites/apps, and then (3) apply to jobs. 

* Is this the right way to go about switching to a CS career after college? Or is there a more effective way to do it?

* Are there important changes/details I should add to my plan?

* Are there any potential obstacles?

A recent Hacker News post by a man named Andrew was voted to the front page and received over 50 comments (as of my post).  The post was called [Ask HN:  Would you hire me?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5704127), and Andrew specified that he was talking about a junior level position.

He provided the following details about himself:

* 28 years old with a Finance Degree from a non-Ivy league school
* Spent the last two years living overseas teaching English and learning to code
* Fairly well versed in html, css, javascript, and PHP
He also included links to his:

* GitHub – handful of repos, 7 months as a member, pretty active over the last quarter
* Stack Overflow profile – 521 reputation, top 37% this quarter, 16 badges
* Blog – Attractive UI, 7 overall posts (a few with some code), with the highlight being details of a Chrome extension he built and demonstrates in a video

Andrew received a fair amount of positive feedback, and not one single poster gave a *‘you are not hirable‘* response.  No CS degree, no professional experience, yet a highly technical audience were either mostly positive and at worst neutral on hiring (considering is more accurate) this potential applicant.  Only a couple responders mentioned looking at the one project he listed, and none referenced the quality of his code samples on his blog or GitHub, so we might assume that no one even bothered to look at his code.  Interesting.

Part of the explanation for the positive response is undoubtedly the makeup of the Hacker News crowd, which does not include a large contingent of HR reps from large companies who control a great deal of the hiring decisions.  Place this resume and story on Monster or Dice, and I expect that Andrew would receive responses from less than a quarter of his viewers.  Possibly less than a tenth.

I admit, if I were to see this candidate’s resume (assuming it reflected the details he put on HN), I would absolutely want to speak to him.  The clients I represent, which are mostly startup and early stage software companies, are more representative of the HN crowd (at least in terms of evaluating engineers) than most larger companies.  And even if I did not have a great opportunity for him today, I would think that a few years down the road he will be someone that I’d want to represent.

What is it about this candidate with no experience and no highly relevant education that gets our attention?  Of the details we have about Andrew, how many could have impacted my decision to speak to him?

When evaluating talent and the decision whether or not to interview a candidate for a software job, I must rely on several attributes that have historically been attached to quality talent that were successful in receiving job offers from my clients.

*Let’s break it down.*

* **28 years old with a Finance Degree from a non-Ivy league school** - Most readers, including myself, probably didn’t give this any thought.  His degree in finance should indicate some math background, and if he had listed his specific school that would have had an impact.  Although most might be reluctant to mention it, the age demographic is probably a positive based on the industry, as he obviously has some life experience and maturity but will not fall prey to any old dog/new tricks bias.

* **Spent the last two years living overseas teaching English and learning to code** – Teaching any subject to any students is valuable experience for almost any profession, and should indicate some level of communication skills.  The international aspect adds a bit more interesting background than if he were teaching domestically.  Some who chose to speak to Andrew may have been strongly influenced by the oversas aspect, as this could also show some willingness to face risk and change.

* **Fairly well versed in html, css, javascript, and PHP.  Just getting started with Ruby** - His claim of being ‘well versed’ is only a self-assessment, but that could be at least somewhat validated (or invalidated) by anyone taking a look at his blog’s source or GitHub account.  This at least indicates that he is learning technologies that will give him some marketability based on demand for these skills.  We may question Andrew’s choices if he were learning a less popular skill.

* **GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Blog** - For those that make decisions about technical talent, the fact that Andrew has both a GitHub and Stack Overflow account is probably more of an indicator of possible talent than what is actually in the accounts.  Most candidates in my experience don’t have a GitHub/Bitbucket or SO account, but those who do have accounts are historically more successful with my clients than those who don’t.  The attractive blog and few technical posts are yet another indicator, showing some passion as well as the ability to articulate his ideas in writing.

**What other details may have led to the decision of HN readers or people like me who would at least want to speak to Andrew?**

* **He reads Hacker News** – Even if he isn’t a senior developer, he at least appears to have spent some time in one community where they frequent.

* **He comes across as modest and doesn’t appear to feel entitled** - You don’t see anywhere in Andrew’s post a reference to how awesome he is or how he is ‘kicking CSS’s ass on a daily basis’.  His responses to feedback are very positive, grateful, and polite.  The choice of ‘well versed’ over some other terms that may be linked to overconfidence was wise.  Andrew also will not be accused of sounding entitled to a great dev job, and on the contrary he comes across as someone who knows he has to earn it.  Perhaps that is a function of his lack of a CS degree, but either way he appears to be taking the right approach.

* **He’s already creating product** – Although he is only early on in his tech studies, Andrew has a product on the market that you can find in the Chrome Web Store that you can download.  There are developers with 20 years of experience that haven’t built any of their own tools or products yet, but this guy is two years in and has that mindset.  Some may question how great (or even good) a product someone at this level of experience could build, but the desire to produce and distribute a tool is something that perhaps can’t be taught.

**Note:**  Other indicators I use regularly include:

* Past employers – Some companies frankly have a higher standard of hiring
* Technical hobbies – Arduino, build robots, or create things at home
* Speaking or writing – Presentations and publications are usually strong indicators
* Tool choice – What blogging platform or operating system you run at home
* User group and meetup – Shows interest and passion

**Conclusion**:  Hiring managers and recruiters are making quick decisions to interview and consider candidates, and as demonstrated by this HN post it seems that there are several recognized indicators of possible talent.  For job seekers, you may want to display links to your accounts prominently, and highlight details such as independent product development.

Of course, these indicators are not perfect.  I, too, have a GitHub and Stack Overflow account and a blog that covers technology (and I even run one of the best Java Users’ Groups in the world) – but I don’t write code.  Readers of HN should not hire me.

I made (what I think are) a lot career mistakes and want to share some of them. There are obviously many finer details left out. The point of this is to share and maybe someone out there can get some benefit from reading. This is NOT a career guide, and most of these points might not even matter to your situation. Also, I didn't proof read this.

And some context: I'm a 28 year old male in NYC.

Year 0

I started doing web programming for pay before I graduated college as a part time freelancer. Since I was still green it involved mostly simple layouts/css/php with visual design work. Pay averaged around $12-15 an hour. It was ok but hours were very limited.

Once I graduated I gave a shot at full time freelancing. I grossly underestimated projects. Wasted a lot of time travelling, didn’t bill, and basically didn’t know what I was doing. I still lived at home so I wasn’t starving when I made around $15-20k my first year. Technical scope was still close to that during school, but I stayed up to date with the world of web dev. I barely had any decent portfolio to show either.


Year 3

My first full time job after college was with a graphic design studio. Originally scoped to be WordPress/Drupal. I thought working in a graphic design studio would be great since that was my other competency. Nope. I was essentially producing sites based on spec with little say in technical decisions. To be fair the small size of most of the clients didn’t have much room for hosting and ops in their budget. I started at a paltry $45k with some benefits.

At this time I started picking up Python and learned more of the other aspects in web development. I feel this was the beginning of my transition from developer to engineer. I wanted to solve technical problems, not bust out WP sites with a plugin here and there. Sure there were challenging projects but those came once in a blue moon, and they’re still more or less content web sites. There was no thought to using Python, mongo, heck... ANYTHING else. It was LAMP because dreamhost is cheap and so easily available. If the Principal of the company didn’t know of the other solutions, it didn’t exist! I have tried multiple times to objectively promote other platforms and approached to no avail.

The positive is this did give me much better exposure to working in a structured project: deadlines, specs, deliverables, proposals, etc. The end results were of high quality, and a few rare projects allowed me to make e-commerce sites and use popular APIs.

I stayed there for five years. I ended the job making around $57k. This is probably my biggest mistake in my career advancement. I just got complacent and lazy. I should’ve stayed about three years tops.

Year 8

WOO! Startup! Making $75k and living the stereotypical startup lifestyle. Not as much as I would have hoped to make but I was so sour of the previous job. If I had taken the time to improve my own technical skills I would have landed a higher paying job, I think. I got rejections from a lot of companies during the interview process.

Strangely enough the main product I was working on is still on the LAMP stack (ugh) but I get much more say in technical decisions and any and every prototype in any platform is welcome. Other perks included working any hours as long as the work gets done, laid back, alcohol in the work place, and telecommuting.

Everything was pretty sweet but I’ll admit working in LAMP still sucked. I saw ads of Node, RoR, Django, etc. And I’m still here constantly going back to php.net because I can never remember the needle/haystack parameter ordering.


Year 9 (today)

I left the startup on good terms and I knew my next job would make me more money. I was getting interest from companies offering $90k minimum (20% increase).

But it’s still LAMP.

One thing I’m starting to notice is if money is what you want to go for, just stick with .NET, PHP, and Java and go for the companies with deep pockets.

This next paragraph is just a guess based on my observation: if you want to go for the startups with deep pockets (due to huge venture investments) start and keep up with the trends. If I picked up RoR and accepted a junior level job three years into my first full time job, I’d be at least mid level. I regret not taking that path. Idealism doesn’t always work, it’s still about marketing. The thing about startups is they can and will continue following trends because 1. it makes their workplace look sexy for engineers, 2. the next big thing can more or less be combined with the existing product nicely.

As for me right now I passed on the 20% (minimum) wage increase to try at my own PaaS company.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,t3_18j8vn,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18j8vn/a_look_back_at_my_nine_years_as_a_professional/,

Help?,Phoxe,42,3,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16yv6p/studying_cs_makes_me_worried_because_of_my_peers/,"Hi guys. I'm currently a freshman CS student. I have been very involved with computers my entire life (mostly in a gaming sense, but I do know my way around a computer) and have been wanting to work with them as my career for my whole life. However, as I started taking my classes at my university, I quickly became worried about how well I would do as a CS major. While I have done fine in my classes so far, my peers make me feel like I will eventually fall short and not be able to do anything with my knowledge.

All of my peers that are studying computer science have been programming since who-knows-when, and they are all part of the hacking/tech support/""that guy"" scene when it comes to computers. While I do know quite a bit about computers, I often feel as if my peers are already leagues ahead of me. I'm still the guy that people go to in my dorm for computer help most of the time, but I feel that if one of my peers was in my building as well, I wouldn't even be looked at. It's hard to put the way I feel into words, so maybe with your comments I'll be able to elaborate a bit more.

Anyways, I'm looking for any kind of advice here. I am motivated to keep working with computers, but I'm worried about the quality of my future life because of my peers (if that makes sense).

You know the guy who takes your place is just going to trash talk your code and tell management you did everything wrong.""

I thought about this for a while and realized even I was guilty of this when I first took the job. There were lots of little ""hacks"" that didn't make sense to me at the time and often when I would uncover them I would offhandedly bitch to my boss about what a hack the last guy was. I may have been right in some cases, but in many situations, I now understand why certain shortcuts were taken.

The reality is that management at this company (and many I imagine) aren't technical. They believe whatever their ""lead developer"" says. 

I'm curious if this is a wide spread phenomenon in the programming industry and how it can be avoided short of always writing perfect code with perfect documentation (and even then, good luck on agreeing what ""perfect"" means or what the appropriate approach really was).

I’m 35, 10 years out of college w/ a BS in CS.   Soon after graduating, I got a job building simple web apps for a local start-up, and it evolved into a “senior” position where I now make a modest living still building web apps.  

They trusted me to be the lead on pretty much every project, so I pretty much had to learn “best practices” on the fly.  It was (and still is) a very small company, so the few programmers there have distinct projects with little overlap.  To this day I have not worked with anyone much more experienced.  Over the years, when someone left, their responsibilities were doled out to those who stayed, or taught to new hire fresh faced, right out of school.    They don’t like to pay the big bucks for “real” talent.  My boss?  He’s a basically a tech savvy salesman with no programming knowledge.  That’s great for my job security but not my career.

They ride us.  Hard.   Especially as deadlines get closer.  Long days, sometimes entire weekends.  (They buy us greasy pizzas for lunch!  How kind!)   As the “senior” I often get tasked w/ projects that I have no right to be doing like server maintenance.   But they pay me, and have the patience to let some deadlines or requirements slip as long as they ultimately get a working product.

At the beginning, this was all fun.  Like a kid being handed the keys to a new car.  I  stuck with what I knew best (.NET) and picked up what I needed along the way (Javascript, SQL, etc.).  But eventually that shiny new car became just a car.  Driving became less about fun and more about sitting in traffic and dealing with idiots.   I stopped learning new things because I didn’t need to.  The younger programmers took my old job of improving existing code.  I got to do “new” things, which I thought would be great, but it’s all in the same languages I’ve been using, so I got nothing out of it -- other than my  paycheck at the end of the week.   I tried to pick up new things outside of work, but I just couldn’t do it well.   Part of it is from being burnt out mentally from the day job, and the other part from not having anything to grow towards.

So the last few years have been a cycle of being silently disgruntled, being thrown a bone (as a “fun” but short project), then back to working on old code.  Each cycle, I’ve been more adamant about leaving -- if I can find a job.

I look around and see brilliant websites, mobile apps, tablet apps, etc and the new technologies that drive them.  And here I am using .NET 3.5 and SQL 2008 to build yet another business tool or report.  I miss having my work under the public eye.  (more on that later)  I want to leave.

But my job experience is so fragmented -- bouncing from project to project, with long stretches of “it’s built now, so just add little features/fixes when we ask you to” in between.  My 10 years of work boil down to a few years  experience in any particular realm.   And “experience” is such a misnomer.  I may have worked in, say,  .NET for much of these 10  years, but I feel like I got max 3 years of real experience out of it and learned nothing the other 7.    So, I feel like I’m not equipped to take jobs that ask for 5+ years, and in the few job interviews I’ve taken lately, my feelings have been justified even if they don’t say it to my face.

Many places ask for “team leaders” but despite being a “senior” programmer, I’ve never had a team to manage.   Agile? Scrum?  Unit Tests?  Never done it.  Never knew how.  Never had the need to.  The company lives dangerously like that.

I should also mention that I have a mortgage (barely above water, so I can’t move to greener pastures), a wife, and hopefully a kid or two in the near future.  I recognize that I’m just digging myself deeper, if I stay where I am.  So I interview where I can, with hope that I can land another  job that where I can grow again.  But the pay offered is consistently less (up to $15K less) than what I’m earning now.

Freelancing would be my dream job.  In fact, I published several Windows programs in my HS/college years before I buckled down for school and “the real world.”  But to freelance you need clients, and to have clients you need to show them work, and I have little to show for my last decade of work (thanks NDA’s).  Besides, I feel like I’m well behind the curve in this era of “responsive design,” mobile browsing, and cloud programming, since I spent  the better part of a decade writing web apps for offices not the general public.

So my current thinking is to just take the first offer that makes me happy even if it pays less.  Take the rejuvenation I get from that job to fuel a freelancing gig on the side to cover the difference.  Forget about buying a new car (current car is 10 years, but low miles and Japanese so it should last a few years more at least).  Put aside plans for kids if need be.

It’s financially risky, but I don’t think I can take many more months of my current place.  

I guess what I am searching for from this /r/ is some validation or advice to my career path.

1362822336.0,39,self.cscareerquestions,19yr8v,Am I too old for internships?,AtheistKharm,43,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19yr8v/am_i_too_old_for_internships/,"I'm a 30 year old adult trying to get my life back on track by going back to school. I'll spare you all the details on why I had my head up my ass for so long. The bottom line is I'm determined to get BS in Computer Science and make a career out of software development/engineering. I need some advice, but first some background:

I have a wife, two kids, mortgage, a full-time job, and go to school full-time. On top of all that, the wife is also going back to school, but while working part-time. We are still in the process of figuring out if this is even feasible. We both want to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, but it's not easy to say the least.

I'm currently going to TCCD (in the DFW area in Texas) and doing their Associates of Arts transfer degree. I have only finished 22 credit hours (7 classes) so far and currently taking 14 hours (4 classes). I currently have a 4.0 GPA and I'm trying really hard to keep it that way, but science classes such as General Biology for Science Majors make it challenging. Due to my situation, I'm not able just transfer to any college I want to. I have been planning on transferring to UNT which is closer to where I live but further from where I work than say UTA, for example. I have been following the UNT 2012-13 computer science transfer guide (found here: http://essc.unt.edu/registrar/articulation/ direct link here: http://essc.unt.edu/registrar/articulation/TransferGuides/2012-13/Engin/CENG%20Computer%20Science%20(BS)%202012-13.pdf). 

Right now I have the luxury to pick and choose what days and times I want classes to be on that meshes really nice with work. However once I transfer, scheduling classes at University–as far as I can tell–will not be as convenient. I have talked to my boss about this and he is willing to manipulate and/or reduce hours to help me out (which is great). 

One question would be, should I consider prestige of UNT vs UTA or should I go with whatever is more practical? They seem about the same to me.

Internships have been on my mind a lot lately because of how important people say they are to finding a job. The thing is, I'm a laptop technician working in a production environment, and I have an embarrassing amount of experience doing just that (about 10 years in this dead end field). In addition, I have been working for my current company over 5 years now (yay more vacation); so I rather not have to quit just to pursue internship experience. However, I'm definitely willing to do it if it's worth it. I should note though, I have done some technical writing for this company and it looks like there is going to be more opportunities to get more experience doing just that. Seems like there are plenty of little programming/scripting projects I can do on the side (that I dreamed up) to help the company out. I don't really know how good that would look on a resume because in the end it is very unlikely my job title or main duty is going to change.

I am aware of how important it is to get involved in an open source project on github or wherever. And this is another main thing I worry about all the time is not having enough time to really do stuff on the side. For example, I would like nothing more than to spend the next week during spring break doing coding. In fact I will be spending a decent about of time working ahead in my C++ class to get that out-of-the-way, but a great deal of my time is going to be spent studying for this madman Biology Lab exam I have the week after spring break.

Any kind of general advice that you guys have is greatly appreciated.

1355324139.0,38,self.cscareerquestions,14q69z,Am I an unreasonable interviewer?,dev91throwaway,45,7,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14q69z/am_i_an_unreasonable_interviewer/,"Apparently I've become labeled as the code bigot or algorithms curmudgeon at my office because of my desire to see candidates display a modicum of basic skills in their interviews. I don't think what I'm asking for is unreasonable, but I'd be curious to hear from others.


The other day, for example, I interviewed someone who purported to have 12 years of experience in .NET, who was seeking a leadership position in the company. This candidate said they were used to mentoring other devs and usually being in a leadership position. I explained that while that's all good and fine, we do expect to get our hands dirty; we're quite a small company, and was told that they'd have no problems doing so. I decided to lead off with (what I thought was) a simple algorithms question:


Given an arbitrary string, write a function to return the first non-repeated character (e.g. BLOB would return 'L'). I assumed this would be a warmup, a layup, and that once bested we could go on to other, more interesting questions. Boy was I wrong. Candidate spent 10 minutes getting pretty much nowhere. Their first tack was to use LINQ to get the answer, which already raised a red flag with me. I kept dropping hints left and right, and they kept looking for some API function in the string class that would find them the answer (which I wouldn't accept anyways; not the point of the exercise). 10 minutes in and I haven't even heard the naive O(n^2) solution yet (which would have at least given me an indication of some basic problem solving skills), and my time was up and I had to leave. EDIT: To be fair, this candidate was quite enthusiastic about development and new technologies, which is nice, but not enough IMHO.


Fast forward to the post-mortem, and apparently I've become the algorithms bigot in the company, the curmudgeon who expects people to write algorithms to pass interviews. I don't know about the rest of you, but when I interview someone, I interview what they're representing. If you're seeking a leadership position where you mentor developers (on what? How to ""feel good"" about your user stories?) I will call you out on it. I've phone screened 3 javascript devs in the past week who have rated themselves a 7 out of 10 or higher in their knowledge of Javascript, but couldn't explain to me the difference between == and ===. Actually, let me rephrase that: they would give me the textbook answer of ""one checks value and one checks value and type,"" but when questioned on what that means they couldn't come up with an explanation of how the runtime coerces values, and when asked what '1' == 1 and '1' === 1 would evaluate to, one candidate mixed up the two, one candidate said they evaluate to the same thing (?!) and another said ""nobody writes such things in real life."" Am I too harsh or critical for thinking that a self proclaimed ""7"" could produce a simple answer showcasing their understanding of a symbol they probably use every day? Is it foolish for me to assume that someone who claims such familiarity with a language and works with it everyday should actually understand what they're doing with it?


To top it off, chatting with the CEO of the company, he explains that we just need ""warm bodies"" to get things out the door, and at least for the front end side of things, engineering is not something that's high on the priority list. He points to a sister site that was coded up in such a way, and how we haven't needed to make updates to it in 2 years, as a gleaming example of this logic. I wonder, how many updates weren't made because nobody wanted to touch that site? It's easy to point to something that's not oft-updated and use that as an argument for ""quick 'n dirty dev,"" but I feel it's fallacious because most products a company develops will be touched/updated regularly.


IMHO, writing correct programs, although difficult, is only the first step in programming. Step 2 is to make it efficient. And step 3 is to make it maintainable. The CEO, although an extremely intelligent individual, doesn't seem to realize just how much the technical debt that's accrued in the system slows down the development team, and how that happens on a daily basis. He seems to maintain the viewpoint that ""if it works, it's good,"" and I think this is the type of thinking that pervades people who are not in our line of business, or who program on the side and not as their main job; they don't understand the realities of large codebases and how quickly they rot. 


I did finally get him to concede that we need strong engineers on the backend and server side, where performance matters, but I'm not sure how much value is put on maintainability. He's quoted how despite some serious turnover, the codebase has remained alive and the site has been up 24/7 since then. What he fails to mention are the numerous bugs reports that appear on almost a daily basis, how the rest of the dev team finds incorrect and convoluted logic on a daily basis, and how this slows down development of features, quite often dramatically. Throwing more bodies at the problem seems like a seductive argument, but according to Brooks (Mythical Man Month) it's not a reality, and at some point having too many cooks in the kitchen makes things even messier.


In any case, I've started to feel somewhat ineffective and my views unpopular. If I'm in the wrong, please help me understand why.

1340394205.0,34,self.cscareerquestions,vg7vs,Entry Level Job Advice - What worked for me.,scottwuzhear,42,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vg7vs/entry_level_job_advice_what_worked_for_me/,"Preface: This is a short guide that I wish I would have had when I was starting out. I created this short guide for a friend of friend who asked how to land his first entry-level job. This obviously won't work for everyone, but maybe it will help a few people. This guide is just what worked for me.

How to get a job in the IT industry

	Resume
		Make your resume look really sharp. Put all relevant experience, even if it was just a personal project.
		Do NOT use the same resume for every job; tailer your resume to each job. Cover sheets help too.
		It is -OKAY- to put things you've only touched a little bit. Don't lie, but it
		is okay to stretch the truth a little bit. You can always 'fake it til you make it'.
		
	LinkedIn
		Create a LinkedIn account if you haven't and put all relevant information on it.
		Connect with everyone you've worked with on LinkedIn. Connect with any current co-workers,
		and actively connect with recruiters.
		
	Recruiters
		Me: ""Believe it or not, there is an entire industry dedicated to finding you an IT job. All
		you have to do is give them your resume, tell them what you're looking for, and they will
		actively hunt for a job for you.""
		
		You: ""Yeah Scott, that sounds great! So... what's the catch?""
		
		Me: ""The catch is that the company that recruited you gets a cut. If you make $50/hr at your new job,
		your employer will be billed at something around $85/hr, so the recruiter makes $35/hr off of you.
		This doesn't affect what you make, and you won't know how much you're being billed at (most of the time).
		
		Also, your recruiter will offer you benefits, but they aren't free. It'll come out of each paycheck,
		but the plans are usually reasonable.""

		I've personally worked with these two:
			Signature				http://www.sigconsult.com/
			Apex					http://apexsystemsinc.com/
		
		I've had friends use these three:
			Modis					http://www.modis.com/
			TEKSystems				http://www.teksystems.com/
			DO NOT USE: K-Force		http://itoldyounottousekforce.com/theywontansweryourcalls.aspx?srsly=1
		
		Some others I've heard of:
			Robert Half				http://roberthalf.com/
			Volt					http://www.volt.com/
			
			
		Different Types of Contracting:
			
			Full-Time/Direct Hire:
				You start off full-time at the company and the recruiter gets a large sum of money
				from the company up-front. This is very rare, so consider yourself lucky!
				
			Short-Term Contract (1m-6m):
				You're a contractor, but only for a short time. You can make a ton of money on these
				contracts, but you won't get much stability. Don't expect to go full-time from these
				positions. Raise your normal rate 15%+.
				
			Contract (6m-18m):
				You're a contractor for an extended time. There is usually a decent chance to go full-time
				at these positions, but it definitely depends on the company. These give you quite a bit of
				stability.
				
			Contract-to-hire (c2hire):
				You're a contractor who is on the fast-track to get hired at the company. The company wants
				to 'try you out' for a while (usually 90 days or so) to see if you're worth hiring. Beware
				of some recruiters who will lie about the job being c2hire when it is only a regular contract.
				Once you go full-time, your salary will probably drop a small amount, but you'll usually get
				benefits.
				
			Independent Contractor:
				You're an independent contractor who doesn't use a recruiting company. This is very hard to
				do as most large companies only want to use reputable recruiting companies.
				
		Random Advice:
			Beware burning bridges with a recruiting company. There are a handful of really large recruiting
			companies, and if you fuck them then they WILL blacklist you. You don't want this to happen.

I'd also love to get feedback from any other who have been through the process and passed or not.

I arrived onsite and parked in the first spot I saw because I was so nervous despite it not being a visitors spot. I then presented myself at the front desk and waited for my recruiter, with quite a few other people also waiting for interviews. When she came she picked up a chromebook for me and I was brought to the room I would interview in all day. After briefly discussing a few things the first interview came in.

Interview 1
-----------
Very positive experience asked an interesting question which I got through pretty quickly and then was asked to improve performance on one piece of it. This took me a while but I eventually figured it out. Interview told me he was ""very impressed"" so naturally I felt great about this one. Most personable interviewer of the day.


Interview 2
-----------
Second guy was very much in line with the kind of person you probably envision when you think of a Google software engineer, in a totally positive way. Asked a relatively simple question and we went through and discussed performance trade offs and considerations if the problem was instead distributed. It was a very multifaceted question and I thought I did pretty well overall. I can't tell though if the optimizations that we went through after my initial solution though were maybe supposed to be obvious to me from the get go, so many I did less well then I thought.

Lunch Break
------------
Brought to lunch by a nice guy who was an industry vet but relatively new to Google. He contrasted his ex-employeer with Google and I learned a ton about how the company works. He also made me feel that, if I were to get a job, I would be able to handle it and not be crushed under the pressure of being a Google employee.

Interview 3
-------------
After lunch I have to admit I was starting to get pretty exhausted. The interview asked me a question that wasn't too hard but for some reason I started coding in C and then switched to Java so that was a bit strange. He then asked me some sublties about my solution, I understood what he was getting at but the answer depended on understanding how something in Java was implemented which I didn't know, he seemed relatively happy one I identified what the problem might be. We then moved onto an entirely different question, for whatever reason I was pretty much stumped on this one I think I did a good job of coming up with a naive solution and talking through the various factors as I attempted to solve the problem. Whenever I came up with an idea I would point out the flaws and try to improve. Eventually I came up with the general idea of the ""good"" solution on my own but we ran out of time before I could develop it further or implement it in code. This was definitely my most difficult interview I think that the guy was either impressed of how I worked through the problem and tried to solve it or else thought I was way too slow and not even close to Google caliber. Complete question mark here.

Interview 4
------------
Nice guy, relatively simple question again. I got the gist of the solution right away but ran into some slight issues coding it up, mostly around very basic math and mostly because I was pretty exhausted by this point. I may have left some bugs in my final version of the code but the interview didn't seem too concerned or to catch them himself. We talked about improvements,testing and complexity and he was pretty happy and had plenty of time to spare. Instead of asking another we just had a conversation that continued into the parking lot as he walked me out. 

I left feeling really like I have a chance but have since been analyzing it and go back and forth. Did I impress people or did I merely show that I am somewhat competent but slow and maybe a little all over the place? At least I am pretty sure I didn't bomb and think there is a slight slight chance I could get an offer. That said it was an amazing experience and I feel much more confident about interviews with other companies now.

the tl;dr was ""Graduated Sping 2011. Loves all the CS things. 1 year not doing any of the CS things at job. Need to get out. Hoping hard for Seattle. Any advice?""


Well, August 3rd was the last day at my last job. I left and drove across the nation to San Francisco and spent a week and a half there exploring the city with my girlfriend. The hotel was covered by all the Hitlon Honors points I accumulated from my previous job. I interviewed with a start up in SF but there was a huge disconnect between what the recruiter described and what the team expected. Amazon also called me out of the blue and I had a phone interview. We continued up the coast to Seattle and explored a bit. She had to to go home (Vancouver, BC) and I hopped around on AirBnB until late August. I attended PAX and scored a room in a house with a bunch of awesome people. I contacted one of the companies that said, ""If you ever make it out to Seattle, please connect with us!"" I interviewed there and got an offer the next day. This place looked really promising and I probably would have accepted on the spot if I was not interviewing at Amazon. I phone interviewed with Amazon again. A lot of Guild Wars 2. Amazon told me they wanted to proceed to a face-to-face. A ton of studying like mad. Game Day. I nailed every coding question, had a great lunch with the hiring manager, and sparked interesting conversations with everyone I met. After almost a week of silence, I called on October 3rd for a statues update and found out they wanted to extend an offer with more details to follow. After I had a digital copy, I accepted and politely declined the other offer.

**tl;dr Turned my life completely around and I could not be happier. Never give up.**

I'm looking at going to uni for computer science in the UK and I was wondering if it was better to make myself the master of the niche or to diversify my educations so that my job prospects can have a much larger focus. I'd be interested in doing programming for games, but at the same time the college i'm looking at also offers a Bachelors in application development or a bachelors/masters in computer research (bio-mechanical interfacing, brain implants, the likes) all of which I would enjoy doing as possible career directions.

to me the games market is a very narrow band of job opportunity, the game industry is know to be a rather small and tight nit group and thus getting a job could be tricky. the application market (google/microsoft/almost any business that wants in house programming) is a much larger pool to offer potential jobs, but also has some absolutely massive horror stories attached. and finally the research market seems to be the least talked about but most interesting field. highly specialized and technical, but also very lucrative and to me interesting.

He approved it and told me to get started, after which I floundered for a bit and implemented random stages from across the spec that I thought I could semi-figure out.

1368032462.0,32,self.cscareerquestions,1dxwd5,Why the Recruiter Didn't Call You Back,fecak,41,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dxwd5/why_the_recruiter_didnt_call_you_back/,"Original [here](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/05/08/call/)

Technology pros often express their venom for both the overly-aggressive spamming recruiter and the recruiter that doesn’t call back.  However, the group getting inundated with inquiries and the group not getting a response are probably mutually exclusive.  Recruiters provide both groups with a reason to hate the industry!

Whether it is a lack of response to an application to a job posting or the absence of feedback after an interview, job seekers regularly, publicly, and often rightfully voice their displeasure about being left in the dark.  It seems like a fairly minor expectation to assume that a recruiter will have both the decency and the 30 seconds required to at least send a quick email to let an applicant know that the resume doesn’t show the desired skills, or to inform an interviewee that he/she was not selected for hire.  Candidates who take the time to interview have a right to know if they were not chosen, and hopefully will be given at least some explanation.  Yet, based on the volume of complaints, it seems few recruiters extend this minimal courtesy.

After 15 years in the business, I have come to learn that most candidates are grateful to get some feedback on their approach, résumé content/format, or post-interview performance tips.  Delivering the bad news about a potentially life-changing job offer is not an enviable task, and I can understand why junior level recruiters might be less comfortable in those calls.  Once a recruiter makes several notifications, he/she should hopefully learn that it is best to try and extract at least one lesson for the candidate to take away for next time.  Being a recruiter can require equal parts salesman, psychologist, and career coach on any given day.

Keep in mind that the only true benefit a recruiter receives by making these notifications is goodwill and reputation points with candidates, and there is a slight ‘cost’ with taking the time to make notifications (the opportunity cost of the time spent on a notification vs calling the next potential candidate).  I have found that the goodwill earned is well worth the small time investment, and providing honest feedback will differentiate how candidates will rate their recruiter experience.

**So why are recruiters not responding to your applications or resume, and why do they not provide feedback after interviews?**

**No response for an application or resume submission**

* **Your approach made you seem like an arrogant jerk** - Most applicants are professional and mention their qualifications or skills with some level of humility and maturity.  Confidence is a rare asset in the software business, but recruiters are much less apt to respond to egomaniacs and candidates who are disrespectful.  There will be other candidates that are easier to work with, so recruiters won’t waste too much time with candidates that seem immature.

* **You were grossly unqualified** - Sadly, a down overall economy produces an extraordinarily high number of applicants that do not even remotely resemble the required or desired qualifications.  Yes, recruiters get pummeled with unwanted email sometimes too.  I doubt that a significant percentage of the recruiting industry’s harshest critics fall into this unqualified category, but there must be a few.  Although I always try to contact all partially qualified applicants, anyone with no relevant professional or academic background will not get a reply.

* **You appeared qualified, but some detail makes your hire unlikely** - Agency recruiting, and particularly contingency recruiting, is all about playing the odds.  If there are a number of candidates for a position, some will stand out as the most likely to be hired while other applications may contain strong indicators of a much lower hiring possibility.  Any perceived obstacles to hire or details that would make a hire less likely, such as unreasonable salary expectations, unclear work authorization or employment history, or a candidate’s mention of multiple current job offers could prevent a recruiter from responding.  Unfortunately, the most qualified candidate can also be the least likely hire based on these external forces.   I suspect many of those that criticize recruiters fall into this category, where the candidate can cite impressive credentials for the position but has some Achilles Heel in their candidacy that they do not see as an issue.

* **Location** –   If the recruiter’s client is in the middle of nowhere and an applicant claims to be open to opportunities worldwide, the odds are not very good that he/she will choose middle of nowhere over somewhere a bit more interesting.  The recruiter is not only competing with many companies, but many more attractive locations.  A candidate’s professed willingness to move does not change this view, as the likelihood of a candidate’s move is typically low if any local employment options are available.  Likewise, if the candidate’s address indicates a long commute, recruiters may be less apt to respond.  Candidates are usually very willing to relocate for very unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, but most jobs don’t fall into that category.

* **The volume of applicants made notification impossible** –  Internal corporate recruiters are probably more likely to get an overwhelming response than their agency counterparts, but a large applicant pool may result in some submissions not even being reviewed.  If no human even sees the application, it is unlikely you will get a personal response.

* **Your application contained a sloppy introduction or résumé** - When an applicant cuts and pastes their introduction (today’s cover letter) and neglects to include the proper company name, it lets the recruiter know that this candidate is probably very active and at least slightly careless.  Multiple spelling and grammatical errors will make recruiters question why they should invest time with a candidate who invested so little time and effort in their application.

* **The job has been filled** – One would hope a recruiter could quickly inform a job seeker that a position is no longer available, but if there are many applicants the process could become time consuming.

**No response after an interview**

* **The recruiter has no news to give you** – Just as recruiters may feel they have little to gain by further contact with rejected candidates, hiring managers may decide their time is better spent on tasks other than explaining to recruiters why a candidate was not chosen.  It is also not uncommon for recruiters to get radio silence from the companies they represent in specific situations.  Managers and execs may be stumped on how (or if) to inform a recruiter about a potential hiring freeze, a funding issue, or management shakeups that could negatively impact their ability to get new hires on board.  If the post-interview decision is a definite ‘no’, recruiters should find out quickly and be willing to share that news with candidates, but based on anecdotes it seems many recruiters completely ignore requests for feedback from rejected candidates.

* **The recruiter is waiting for the right moment (that may never come)** - If an agency recruiter has multiple candidates interviewing for one position, it is in the recruiter’s best interest to keep the client’s top choices ‘warm’ for as long as possible, or at least until an offer is accepted.  A recruiter will not want to tell you “Hey, you are actually my client’s third choice for the role, but our first choice is dragging her feet on accepting the offer, so just hang tight.”  Hopefully your recruiter will provide at least some degree of transparency and insight, but don’t expect that from most.

* **Your poor interview performance damaged the recruiter’s relationship with the client company** - This is thankfully quite rare, but unprofessional behavior in an interview will hurt the recruiter’s reputation and make a call from the recruiter unlikely (and probably unnecessary).

* **You didn’t follow-up or ask for feedback** – Do not expect that a recruiter will contact you independently and unsolicited with interview feedback.  Recruiters with a booming business may be relying on either your request for feedback or the incoming call/email from the client as a  workflow prompt to notify you (I rely on this prompt often), so be sure to contact the recruiter after the interview to assess how you did and to express interest in learning results.  It looks professional and shows both initiative and interest when candidates contact recruiters after an interview to debrief, so make that a habit anyway.

If you are not hearing back from recruiters, take a look at your submissions to see if you may fall into one or more of these categories.  Continue to ask for feedback after interviews, as you are entitled to a timely answer.

When I transferred in I was practically a junior and jumped straight into my computer science courses and was taking up to 15 credits of computer science classes per semester. I noticed many of my fellow juniors were already working nice paying internships in development but I was unable to find one since I lacked the skills necessary having just started my computer science classes, and even though I was junior, the only classes I had taken up until then were gen eds. Senior year when I finally had developed programming skills through classes/self-studying I was unable to find an internship in development since many companies preferred sophomores or juniors since they would be around longer than seniors. So i ended up taking an unpaid internship through my college working help desk at the local city hall. I'm nearing graduation now but I'm having trouble landing interviews since my only experience is help desk and it involved no development whatsoever. What should I do to increase my chances to be considered? I feel a bit low knowing that I have coeds who have had high paying development internships while I was working at the grocery store to support myself. I keep hearing about doing projects on github but I have no idea how to get started, and those would have to wait till after I graduate since I'm currently working around 35 hours a week between my part-time job and my internship, as well as taking 18 credit hours worth of classes in order to graduate on time.

It sounded promising so I asked him a few details over email and when all sounded good scheduled a phone interview. 

Well, the guy fucking told me 'have a nice day' and hung up on me as soon as I started asking what I would consider ""medium"" questions for a senior level, asking $115+ per hour java dev with 12 years experience.

2.) What is encapsulation?
3.) What is polymorphism?
4.) If you had the following classes- cell_phone, car, and flashlight that all needed to implement the method ""battery"" using polymorphism, what type of classes could do this? 
5.) (after he struggled to answer question four, and I guided him to the answer), I asked what the differences were between Abstract and Interface classes.
So, here is where it goes down hill, he told me that no one needs to know these details and I reiterated that it was a senior programmer position and important that one knows the senior level knowledge... 
Then I started asking about String, stringbuilder and stringbuffer... Then multi-threading and big O notation/Order N... At this point he was we clearly struggling and had started arguing that no one needs to know these specific questions and that he writes good code. 

So My question, are these questions totally unreasonable for a $115-130.00 an hour senior position?

More specific: I don't want to end up with the programming language equivalent of a steam-engine in a year or two when the new shiny Relearn-Everything-Again-Language (now for real!) surfaces.

**The situation:** This only started some months ago, when I thought it would pay off to transition from the old Windows Forms technology to the new and more potent Windows Presentation Foundation. I've invested a lot of time and energy into really understanding what happens in the background and how I can leverage some advanced techniques to get the most out of it (MVVM et al), yet through this quest for information, I've also stumbled upon quite a lot of critics and articles that paint a more gloomy picture of the future of said language concept/framework. 

To add insult to injury, WPF's little brothers aren't exactly taking the world by storm either:

* **Windows Phone 7**:  I haven't even seen one in the wild (in my daily life) and I don't want to use hyperbole here, I really haven't seen a single one used by people I interact with, known or unknown, but I do see Androids and IPhones all over the place. DOA?

* **Silverlight**: In my opinion, was a me-too Flash-wannabe, well-adjusted for C#, but provided an answer to a problem that didn't exist in the first place. It failed, but Microsoft anounced that HTML5 will save the day. I can only wonder about what circle of hell these rather comfy programmers awaits, coming from a strong-typed, debugger-friendly language into the boiling pit of lava that is browser incompatibilities and hunting for AJAX/JS bugs through Firebug, spending your day hacking CSS until your fingers bleed and finding new and innovative ways to crash the server. Statements like that make me wonder whether the PR department is in charge of taking the decisions in Redmond or whether they're so dense and so far removed from reality that they believe their own marketing ploys, using doublespeak and ambiguity to not underline the way they've not beaten the best in the industry on a whole range of subjects.

* **Surface**: While still an emerging technology, these machines still have 'wealthy status symbol' written all over them, and I don't see or hear much about them, except for being an eye-catcher at some fancy event. At this point, I don't see it replace any regular counters/bar tables/office equipment anytime soon. Touch and multi-touch certainly have their uses, but to expect everyone to just buy a Surface and ... do what? UX certainly is important, but why point your arrows at such a niche market?

Last thing I heard was that their event called MIX is cancelled for 2012, which drove me to write this post. This signals me that they're silently closing the door again, only to come out with something new in the near future. If Metro is something else all over again, I'd rather not learn it, but rather spend my time on something I can truly specialize in instead. I just hope I didn't wast my time with WPF. Perhaps I should go back to C++/Java?

Mobile development seems nice, but I'm not sure whether to go for Android or IOS. Perhaps MonoTouch could allow me to transition using a combination at first, while upgrading my native platform coding skills. Also, I have no idea of the demand in that sector and don't see myself come up with a new app every week, furthermore I don't know how long it would take me before it becomes profitable.

**EDIT:**

I'd like to share a response to a similar question I posed to my professor, he works in robotics R&amp;D:

&gt;I would say that the most important thing to be one of the top tier developers would be flexibility. See the techniques used in different area of Computer Science - Operating Systems, Networking, Database Systems, AI, Programming Languages, Web Development - and even from other disciplines - Mathematics, Analysis, Physics, any Engineering discipline, etc. Remember that software development generally is in support of other disciplines - and certainly the more diverse and interesting applications are.

&gt;Let's say you have the opportunity to help develop a control system for a telescope. Don't think about what you don't know about controlling telescopes. Remember that you do know things about developing software that the telescope people don't. After the control system is done, ask about helping with the analysis software. Get good at interacting with the domain experts. They typically know (at least to some extent) what they want, but don't know how to make the tools that help them do it. [Domain experts - engineers, scientists, business people, etc - are generally lousy developers, but that can muddle through and get things that work, eventually. They love it when you give them good tools.]

&gt;Learn to communicate. The most important language you'll use is English. I'm sure you heard me say that many times. Volunteer to work on proposals and business development activities. It sounds boring, but you learn a lot and hone some valuable skills.

I have had a few jobs since graduating in 2011 with a CS degree and haven't ever been able to find any happiness in my career choice. It might be premature because I am so young, but I feel like I am in a hole that I can't get out of. (I am also trying to rewrite this the best I can because I accidentally closed the tab...great week let me tell you).

My last job gave me $55k starting out, sat me in a corner in the back room, and never seemed to remember I was there. I had no work typically, or work that I had no idea how to do since I was new and everyone else was too busy to try and work with me on it. It was 90% of the work was with 10% of the people because, you guessed it, horrible management. I now work with a couple of old friends who I have known for over a decade and, when described, sounds like the best job a programmer could ever get.
I basically get no emails or phone calls. There are 3 of us down here, not overloaded, but will always have work as the company upstairs (my coworker's father's company) is the company we basically support, along with a few other clients. I come in and basically am given work as the day goes by. Sometimes I get something that takes a while to complete, sometimes there are 4 or 5 tasks that take about 5 mins each to complete. A lot of times I sit around pondering why I hate what I do or waste time on this website and others. The thing that made this all come down yesterday was that he asked me to get a new project started using MVC and set it up with twitter bootstrap. I have tried to learn MVC in the past but didn't really have much success and sort of took a hit to my pride. Well, trying again just to play around with it, I realized that I still had no idea what I was looking at or what I needed to do to get going, and I just felt no motivation to even try to learn it (probably because I have been depressed the past 2 weeks).

I thought just a couple of weeks ago this all was stemming from my girlfriend's job because she works odd hours and I don't see her very much, but not until a couple of days ago did I realize that the things that are making me unhappy and sad and angry are all because of my choices.
I get into these cycles of hating my job, trying to figure out what I would want to do, then all the reasons why I can't do them. I feel like I need a change of scenery, but I don't have a clue what I would change to. I feel that if I didn't do programming, got a job somewhere else, I would make a lot less money and not be able to afford it. I feel like if I went back to school, I definitely wouldn't be able to afford it and, anyways, I don't even want to go back to school right now. I have too much debt from the first go around and what if I paid for another degree that I wouldn't like any more than what I have. I feel like I want to move, but I think I would just take my problems with me and not have my friends anymore. And then because this is how I think, I don't sleep real well, if any. I have to take Lorazepam just to try to feel normal (they are prescribed) and a lot of times they don't even seem to work.

So I am asking for some guidance since I don't know where else to turn really. However, I do also realize that I shouldn't expect any answer from anyone else to solve my problems if I can't seem to find one myself. I am young enough to where I should be able to have plenty of time to figure things out, but I feel like I am in a hole that I can't dig out of. I don't want to waste away my one life in something that doesn't make me happy, and honestly am not sure if any of those things that I said I feel like I need are the answers. But something has to give and I don't know what that is.

I have heard that maybe reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/0316167266) is a good starting point. I might go get it today.
I am sure I am not the only one that has these issues ( I have been scouring the CS subs and this sub and see it as well). Am I just burnt out? How could that be if I only have been doing this legitimately for just over a year?

tl;dr: 27 yo who hates his career currently. no idea on where to turn or what to change. looking for someone or people to relate to who have had this bump in their life.

This is a story about Microsoft.

To preface this all, I am a huge Microsoft fanboy; I've always adopted their products early on and continue to use them as my primary devices. I own a Surface, a Lumia 920, and a W8 Desktop &amp; Laptop. During my undergrad, I was a Microsoft Student Partner on campus.

I'm currently in a Masters Program in Computer Science (my undergrad, however, wasn't CS-related). I applied for a summer internship position as a Program Manager. I got through the phone interview and was flown out to Seattle for a day of interviews. I had four interviews, with the last one being one with the hiring manager. They all went well.

Three days later, I was sent an email from my recruiter saying essentially ""we are going to offer you a position, when's the best time to talk?"" I respond and we are scheduled to talk. A week later, as I'm waiting for the offer call, I get a call from my recruiter. Apparently, something had ""changed"" in the system. When the recruiter checked, there was all ""Recommend for Hire"" ratings from the four people I interviewed with. But now, the last guy had changed his mind. Thus, I was not going to be offered the position. Heartbroken is an understatement for what I felt. The recruiter then said that they were going to fly me out to interview with a team that was ""a good fit for me."" That sounded great! Two weeks later, I hear nothing. Finally, I get a generic response form my university recruiter saying that all of their PM intern positions had filled up quicker than they had expected and that I was effectively out of luck until August. 

In a week period, I had gone from pure jubilation from landing my dream internship to rock bottom. This was back in January, and to this day I still don't have an internship locked up yet. It affected my psyche and confidence, as well as my motivation to apply for stuff.

I guess the point of all of this is, be careful when it comes to dealing with offers with companies.

It has been a long and bumpy road. I started my career working as a Java developer back in the early 2000s after I got my BSCS in the Bay Area. Got laid off after working there for 2 years during the dot com boom and couldn't find another job. Ended up working as an IT guy for the Army for 7 years. I knew I wanted to go back to the software field after the Army so I busted my ass and studied for a MSCS while I was working for the Army and was deployed all over the world. 

I just came back to the bay area a little over a year ago and was trying to get back to the software field but the gap in my career history didn't help at all. I had interviews from companies of all sizes (including Google, Oracle, and Salesforce) but no offers. It got so bad my friends and family told me to give up searching for software jobs and just find something. But I didn't give up. 

I kept updating my resume and posted it on Dice, Monster, Indeed, and a few other job sites. I also kept up with my Java skills by doing coding challenges. A few weeks ago I got a call from a recruiter about a Java developer opportunity. She set me up for a phone interview and 2 face-to-face interviews and I got an offer today. The only down side is, because I have such a huge gap in software job experience, I am getting paid as an entry level engineer. I didn't mind. I needed to get my foot back into the door, so I accepted the offer.

Basically, my advice to people who are in the exact same position as I was is Don't Give Up. Practice your coding skills on your free time. Some people wouldn't recommend working with recruiters but I think some of them out there do want to get you jobs (that IS how they get pay). So it never hurts to talk to them. Keep learning new stuff. Learn a new language or build an Android/iOS app. Move if you have to. And always keep searching.

Before we begin, I acknowledge that companies want to hire cheaper labor when possible, and some shops care less about quality products than others.  And for the record, I’m over 40.

By saying you are overqualified for jobs, what are you really saying?  “I am more skilled or more experienced than the job requires.“  That feels kind of good, doesn’t it?

SPOUSE:  How did the interview go?
JOB SEEKER:  I didn’t get the job.
SPOUSE 1:  Oh, I’m sorry.  What happened?
JOB SEEKER:  Unfortunately, it turns out my skills are simply too strong.

Of course rejection hurts, but to tell your spouse (and yourself) that you were turned down because you were too skilled or too experienced is much less bruising on the ego than the alternative.  For companies looking to eliminate candidates, using the word overqualified may take some of the sting and fear of retribution out of the rejection.  But is it true?

Think about this scenario for a second.  You are trying to hire a software developer and you estimate that someone with say five years of experience should be able to handle the duties effectively.  A candidate is presented with fifteen years of experience that has all the attributes you are seeking.  This person should theoretically perform the tasks quicker and even take on some additional workload.  Do you really think a company would not hire this person simply because he/she has those additional years of experience?  I would argue that is rarely the case.

Question:  Is ‘overqualified’ a code word used by managers/HR to mean other things?
Answer:  ALMOST ALWAYS

What can overqualified actually mean?
listed in order from most likely to least likely, IMO

* Overpaid/over budget – If your experience &gt; what is required, it generally becomes a problem when your salary requirements are above what is budgeted.  It’s not that you are classified as overpaid in your current role, but that you would be overpaid for the level of responsibility at the new job.  I list this as the most likely culprit because I often see companies initially reject a candidate as overqualified, then hire that same person because of a lack of less experienced quality talent.
* Stagnant – Candidates who have worked for many years as a developer in a technically stagnant and regulated environment will often not thrive in less regulated, more technically diverse firms.  The conventional wisdom, right or wrong, is that you can’t release the zoo lions back into the jungle once they’ve been tamed.
* ‘Overskilled’ - If your skills &gt; what is necessary for the job, an employer may fear that the lack of challenges provided will bore you into looking for more interesting work in the future.  Hiring a tech lead to do bug fixes could lead to a short stint.  There is emerging evidence that shows skilled workers do not exit less challenging jobs quickly or in high numbers, but hiring managers are not quite ready to abandon the traditional line of thinking.
* Threatening – If your experience &gt; those conducting the interviews, there could be some fear that you could be a competitor for future opportunities for promotion.  If a start-up is yet to hire a CTO, the highest geek on that firm’s food chain may be jockeying for the role.  This may sound a bit like a paranoid conspiracy theory, but I genuinely believe it is prevalent enough to mention.
* Too old – Ageism is a real problem, but in my experience in the software world, ageism is also widely overdiagnosed by candidates who think the problem is their age when in actuality it is their work history.  Most of the self-diagnosed claims of ageism that I hear are from candidates who spent perhaps 20+ years working for the same company and have not focused on keeping their skills up to date (see stagnant above).  I can’t say that I’ve ever heard a claim of ageism from a candidate that has moved around in their career and stayed current with technology.  The problem often isn’t age, it is relevance.

Some of the best and most accomplished/successful software engineering professionals that I know are over 50, which is older than some of the candidates I hear claiming possible ageism.  One trait that the overwhelming majority of these engineers have in common is that they didn’t stay in any one place for too long to stagnate.  I don’t think that is a coincidence.

If you are an active job seeker that is continuously hearing that you are overqualified, what can you do to improve your standing?

* Rethink – Try to investigate which of the meanings of overqualified you are hearing most often.  Is your compensation in line with what companies are paying for your set of qualifications?  Do you present yourself in interviews as someone who may become easily bored when your work is less challenging?  Are you making it clear in interviews that you want the job, and you explain why you want the job?
* Retool – Make sure your skills are relevant and being sought by companies.  Invest time to learn an emerging technology or developing some niche specialty that isn’t already flooded.
* Remarket – Write down the top reasons you think a company should hire you, and then check to see if those reasons are represented in your job search materials (resume, email application, cover letters).  Find out what was effective for your peers in their job search and try to implement new self-promotion tactics.
* Reboot and refresh – Take a new look at your options beyond the traditional career paths.  Have you considered consulting or contracting roles where your guidance and mentoring skills could be justified and valued for temporary periods?  Are there emerging markets that interest you?

Terms like ‘overqualified’ and ‘not a fit’ are unfortunately the laziest, easiest, and safest ways that companies can reject you for a position, and they almost always mean something else.   Discovering the real reason you were passed up is necessary to make the proper adjustments so you can get less rejections and more offers.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,t3_yrooc,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yrooc/overqualified_is_overdiagnosed/,

It shows that they code in their free time, have some knowledge of git and probably other tools required for the job, and you can even get a glimpse of their coding style and ability.  That all makes sense to me.

What I want to know is what I should put on GitHub.  I am madly in love with programming, however many of my side projects are tools/websites that bring in a little cash for me.  Obviously, I would not want to release the source code of these projects to the world, as it would make ripping off my ideas a push-button process.  If I weren't making money off of these projects, I wouldn't be worried, but I certainly don't want people to have full access to my code which is bringing in cash.  I'm afraid that without a GitHub chock full of code and projects, potential future employers may favor someone who *did* opt to put their code online.

I don't really have any major pieces of code that I would like to be open source.  I do have plenty of smaller things, but they're all too naive, too highly-specific, or too small to be something what I want to represent myself to the world as a programmer.  Do I just need to write more free/open software that I can share with the world?  Am I overthinking or overestimating the amount that people care about an active GitHub repository?

I don't have any sort of programming blog either.  Is that somewhere that I could show off my projects without releasing the code?  Would potential employers like to see something like that if I can't or would prefer not to share the source code publicly?

The post asks if it is appropriate to follow-up with a correct response afterwards if you answered a technical interview question incorrectly (or responded with “I don’t know”).  As a recruiter of engineers, I’ve taken my share of calls from candidates upset about fumbling a tech question that they would have slam-dunked 99% of the time but froze in the moment,  only to have the correct answer come to them while driving home from the interview.  At the time of this writing, there are four answers listed and (in my opinion) at least a bit of poor advice for job seekers.

The posted question brings up a few topics for thought, which will also be detailed in (plug warning) [my book](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/book).  First, we will cover this specific scenario and the best way to ‘recover’, as well as what is wrong with the answers provided.  Then we will dig a bit deeper into the “I don’t know” problem and reveal the motivations behind technical interview questions and why a simple “I don’t know” (which was recommended by one respondent) is almost never appropriate.

**Recovery From A Botched Interview Question, Postmortem**

The answer in the forum accepted as the best suggested that it was not recommended to send a correct response as it may make the candidate appear ‘obsessive’, and added that the answer could have been looked up after the fact.  Two distinct points were made, and both were (IMO) not helpful.

If the candidate sends a note resembling “I just HAD to get this off my chest, I’ve been losing SOOO much sleep about that answer I messed up“, then of course the obsessive label may be legitimately applied.  However, if the correct answer is provided tactfully using some careful language, the result should be more indicative of tangible interest in the job than an obsession to be correct.

The mention that the candidate could have researched the answer afterwards is probably irrelevant unless the question was a complete softball that any industry professional must know.  If the question was difficult or perhaps a complex programming exercise in an environment approximate to what the engineer would encounter in the real world, one would think that the test should be open book in order to simulate the office experience.

**How To Make The Recovery**

* Email the interviewer and lead with a standard thank you sentiment.
* If there were any legitimate mitigating circumstances that negatively affected your performance, it is relatively safe to mention them (with a slight risk that you are regarded as fragile or that life will impact your work).
* Write out the question as best you remember with a synopsis of the answer you provided.
* Provide the correct answer and dive a little deeper into your knowledge of the subject.  Be careful not to go too deep (which could risk the obsessive tag mentioned earlier).
* Close by reiterating your interest in the position and your willingness to be tested again with either another interview or some exercise (programming task, white board exercise, etc.) that will allow you to demonstrate your ability.

If code is appropriate as part of the answer, write it and send it.  Go slightly above and beyond in your answer if possible by pointing out some other relevant points during your explanation, such as any experiences during your career related to the question.  Results will vary.

**Plain “I Dunno” Answers**

One of the participants in the thread added

&gt; “…’I don’t know’ is a safe answer as many places use negative marking for wrong answers.”

Partial credit for that, but incomplete.  A simple “I don’t know” could possibly be indicated for a specific set of questions, but in general it is better to give a longer response to questions that you can’t solve.  *What?*  Questions that will typically get the dunno answer usually fall into three categories.

**Category 1**- Questions you find difficult, but at least somewhat within the scope of something you could/should know.
**Category 2** - Questions regarding incredibly minute and trivial details that you could possibly know, but that most candidates probably would not answer on-the-spot.
**Category 3** - Questions about a subject that you have absolutely no exposure to and couldn’t possibly be expected to know outright.

**Motivations Behind The Three Types of Questions**

Category 1 questions are fair and the only motivation is to discover what you know and what you don’t.  Nothing to see here, move along.

Category 2 questions are probably a mix of items that could conceivably fall into Category 1 or Category 3, depending on the level of the candidate being interviewed.

Category 3 questions along with some Category 2 crossovers are the ones that almost always have a hidden agenda, and it surprises me when I hear a candidate react surprised when being asked “How many gas stations are there in the US?“.

Category 2 and 3 questions typically are asked for one or more of three reasons.

* To measure your brainpower and memory (mostly Category 2) – Some employers do expect their staff to have an abundance of knowledge readily available without using outside materials.  With the vast amount of resources used by technologists today, most managers value this ability much less than in years past.  In certain cases, the interviewer really does want to know if you can answer the question asked.
* To observe you under duress (both Category 2 and 3) – It can be difficult to simulate various scenarios that happen on a day-to-day basis inside of any particular company.  By asking a difficult or even an impossible question, the employer can get some sense as to how you may function when required to quickly improvise a solution.  Will the candidate admit a lack of knowledge about a subject area or will he/she attempt to feign expertise to potentially appease the interviewer?
* To understand your resourcefulness and how you diagnose problems (mostly Category 3) – Questions with no widely known answer are a somewhat effective way to see how a candidate might approach and break down a future real-world problem, or where the candidate would go to find out.  An example would be Fermi problems, where it is expected that respondents will not have an answer in memory but should be able to provide some estimate by using other information that is more widely available.  “How many gas stations are there in the US?” is a fairly common example of a Fermi problem where an immediate numerical answer would be unexpected and defeat the purpose of the exercise.

^Aside:  A fourth motivation increasingly cited by interviewees is to measure your subservience or your tolerance for and willingness to even try to answer such questions.  There is a large population that feel Fermi problems are useless in evaluating talent, but their value is not the point of this post. 

**Better Alternatives to “I dunno”**

A simple “I don’t know” is rarely appropriate.  Try one of these instead.

* “I don’t know x, but I do know y” - This answer is appropriate for questions related to specific technology experience.  If you are asked if you have used MySQL, you might mention that you have not but you have used another RDBMS.  This lessens the impact of a straight ‘no’ answer, implying that any learning curve will be less severe.
* “I don’t know x, but if you would like I can tell you how I would find out” – This answer allows you to demonstrate your resourcefulness and creativity in solving problems on the spot.  Managers should also value your modesty and the fact that you are not the type of professional that would rather claim expertise than admit not knowing.

1351102890.0,29,self.cscareerquestions,120oen,[UPDATE] Is Google going on a hiring binge? And should I think about interviewing there?,yellowjacketcoder,34,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/120oen/update_is_google_going_on_a_hiring_binge_and/,"Original Thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1037f3/is_google_going_on_a_hiring_binge_and_should_i/).

I had a few requests for follow up to see whether I took the interview, whether I got the offer, and whether I accepted it if I did. 

I did decide to take the interview, after a discussion with my wife. There was a potential for career advancement, she could work remotely and keep her current job, and we actually do have a couple of friends in CA, so we wouldn't be totally isolated. That being said, I would have had to get a really great offer to want to go, since cost of living would be much higher, plus the general uprooting of a family.

I got passed around to 3 different recruiters before the interview. If anyone from Google is reading this: seriously, guys, get your act together. Why do I need three different people to get me an interview? Also, they kept switching what team I was to be working with; I understand Google has lots of teams, but it would be nice to have an idea of what I would be working on.

So, I flew out to SFO on a Sunday, got my rental car, and proceeded to drive around. Unfortunately, whether from stress, something I ate, or just bad luck, I got sick. Like, unable to keep anything down, went to bed at 8PM local time and slept for 12 hours kind of sick. Not a good sign, although I don't think it affected too much of my performance.

Monday morning, I drove into the Googleplex, and registered for my interview. Note to other interviewers - when they say ""get there 10 minutes early"" they mean it. I got there 45 minutes early (after reading the paper and playing phone games and eventually deciding to just head in) and there is NOTHING to do in the waiting room. I usually leave my phone in the car while interviewing so I don't get distracted by it, but I kinda wish I had brought it with me. 

Anyway, two technical interviews in the morning - I thought I did fine. Had a lunch interview with another Googler - my thoughts here were, if you're sending someone to evangelize the company, don't send the guy that has been bounced around 3 teams in 18 months. It kinda sends the wrong message. He also liked to tell me how I could ask anything and it would never get back to the hiring committee. I mean, he told me this at least a dozen times. It made me suspicious but it's not like I had any particularly weird questions.

In the afternoon I had three more technical interviews. One was late, so the whole schedule got shifted and we get ended up getting kicked around the meeting rooms to finish the interview. I feel like I did OK in the first two (there was one problem with an obvious solution, that I didn't see until the end of the session when I was asked ""can you make this faster"", but at least I did see it.). 

The last interviewer was honestly kind of a jerk. Everyone else was affable and polite - he wasn't even polite to the other Googlers. It really stood out in my mind. Also, this is where my sickness from the day before caught up to me and I started going hoarse, which is the wrong thing to have happen in an interview. (I apologized for starting to lose my voice, and he immediately asked ""what, are you making excuses?"" I mean, come on guy, I can barely talk and you're accusing me of trying to get off the hook?) Last, although I think only 1 of the 6 Googlers that interviewed me was American, this guy was very difficult to understand and I had to ask him to repeat himself several times. 

This interview was much less algorithm based and much more nitpicky. Like ""what does this keyword mean in Java?"" nitpicky. I know you should know language features if you're interviewing, but honestly a lot of the time some of that detail is better left to the API. He included questions like ""what is a good reason to use this keyword in this situation"" and after I gave an admittedly not great answer, his response was ""yea, I never run into that situation anyway, it's pretty useless to use the keyword there"". He finished up by asking how I would implement a certain property on a data structure, and then concluded by saying there's a method in the API I could have used anyway. Which strikes me as language trivia that is really not relevant. I figured if I didn't get the offer, it was going to be because of this guy, and I was going to have to work with this guy, I would be happy to not get an offer. Alright, rant over.

Anyway, drove back to the airport, had some in-n-out along the way (spoiler: not as good as west coasters will have you believe), and flew home. 

Later, the recruiter called and asked me to send in some references. Which was odd because they required references on the application. While I had communicated with all my references before hand, and I thought we were all friendly, I figured I should double-check since the opportunity presented itself.

Kids, ALWAYS double-check references before you list them. It turned out that while my old team lead and my old manager and I had communicated in a friendly manner after I left, they refused to be a reference. Turns out my old VP had badmouthed me to my old bosses after I left, and they would not be references on the basis of those accusations (the accusations were ludicrous btw. My buddy that still works there thinks the team lead believed them because he was jealous I was doing better career-wise than my old team. I didn't think he was that petty, but whatever).

Anyway, I got other references that were happy to be good references, submitted them with a note to use these and NOT the ones on the application, and waited.

And Waited.

For two weeks. This is another notoriously annoying part of Google hiring - they take forever to plan things and get back to you. Microsoft, bureaucratic nightmare that it is, gave me an offer the day of my interview with them. There is no (good) reason it should take that long to get back to a candidate.

Anyway, long story short, they declined to give me an offer. Funny enough, when they told me I wasn't getting an offer, it was as if a weight was off my shoulders. I gave Google by best shot, they said it wasn't good enough, and I am quite happy about it. I am sure they will continue to be successful, and I will continue my career in my current company. 

Anyway, thanks for all the advice given in the last thread, and thanks for reading the whole thing if you did. Hopefully nobody is upset by my novel length update (or anti-sneak-bragging). I would still encourage people to interview with Google if they want - there ARE a lot of perks, and you DO work with really smart people on cool products, and it IS great to have on the resume.

Do I just need to code code code until I have stuff that I both enjoyed doing and also worked well, or are there some projects out there that I can do just for the sake of accomplishing the task and it would presumably look good in a portfolio?

How?,bashun,35,7,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1env07/i_bake_bagels_for_10hr_i_want_to_make_money_doing/,"Edit: Thanks everybody, this is a goldmine for a young man. I have a lot to consider now, and I'm very grateful I posted this question (which I was hesitant about). This subreddit is extremely helpful.

I am 21 years old and live in Montreal. I bake bagels. It's great. Mix dough, shape it into bagels, stick em on the wood paddle and into the fire. I make 10 dollars an hour and I have trouble making rent sometimes. I want a new career.

Why am I thinking of CS? Because I have always felt comfortable with computers and when I was young I loved playing in code. I taught myself VRML 1.0 out of a big sourcebook at 12 and moved into Actionscript and HTML, simple stuff that made me very happy.

Then probably somewhere round 15 I stopped exploring code, probably because I thought it wasn't cool enough and I devoted all my time to playing music. So I became an accordionist who knew a little more about computers than most accordionists.

Now here I am at 21, baking bagels and I find myself looking at computers again for 3 reasons. 

 1. I find myself describing life in code and computer metaphors and realise I really miss writing and debugging code, and I believe Steve Jobs when he said ""I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think"", even though I am Canadian. For this alone I would teach myself. **I learnt a lot from the relationship between me and a computer.**


 2. I think it plays to strengths of mine. I dearly love analysing and creative problem-solving.

 
 3. I want a career that suits my financial and lifestyle needs. My mom has always made $35/hr developing and maintaining websites for people, which awed me as a kid but makes sense to me now. My ability to understand computers is valuable. I don't want to keep working $10/hr jobs that don't really use my strengths. (Ideally I want to work half the year and travel half the year, but I realise that may take some figuring). What I am asking from the subreddit is:

* *How can I tell if I just want to understand computers as a hobby, or if I actually want to make my career around them? Is there a Fight Club-like test where I stand on the front porch of CS for three days without food or water to see if I really want to do it?*

* *How can I get an idea of the different realms of computer careers? Cisco certified network engineer, or website developer, or software engineer? Is there a website that gives a really good breakdown of them all?*

I'm already committed to walking myself through the whole of Codecademy, and considering taking that 99$ Groupon for IT University Cisco Certification training.

How can I get an idea of whether a career with computers is really right for me? How did you know?

Thanks, cscareerquestions redditors.

1363901918.0,27,self.cscareerquestions,1arbxv,Having a mid-career crisis. Please advise.,corporatejunkie,30,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1arbxv/having_a_midcareer_crisis_please_advise/,"I work for a big tech company that pays fairly well. Have over 11 years of industry experience, 8 of those in the said company and 3 years in startups. I used to play a mid-level tech architect/lead developer kind of a role in this company, saw a lot of early success, quickly rose through the ranks. Now stuck like a deer in a headlamp. 

Here's what happened:

(wall of text and bitter ranting ahead)

* Worked in scrappy startups for 3 years. Had a lot of solid business ideas and a lot of contacts. Really aspired to strike out on my own, that was my end-goal as I saw it. But the timing was just wrong(post-9/11 economy, huge amount of loans).
* So got a job with the ""company"", temporarily as I convinced myself. It was a budding startup at that time and it had some great talent, some of the best in the industry. The work culture was awesome and the work itself was immensely satisfying. I put in 12hrs every week, and it was worth it. They noticed the amount of hard work you put in and you got credit for what you did and more than that, financially rewarded for it. I was single at that time, was quite good at what I did. After a while they gave me a lot of responsibilities and rewarded me with promotions. Meanwhile the ""company"" was killing it. I learned a great deal about ""soft"" skills and the industry, while making bank. Everything was great.
* While this was happening, a lot of the talented crew left for greener pastures. They were being slowly replaced by bean counters and pencil pushers from the bigger parent corporate which has now bought us. But I was so content and oblivious, I felt like I became a ""fixture"" in our team -- and this team was an important/visible part of the company. And I helped build the team from scratch. I was the youngest in my team, smart beyond my age(or so they said). Pride comes before the fall and what not. 
* After a while I see pencil pushers all around, a lot of ""sucking upwards""/""boss is always right and screw the customers"" attitude. Developers were thought of replaceable cogs, complex technology was viewed as ""hard to understand and proprietary"", ought to be replaced with enterprisey stuff(read: bloated J2EE stack), so that they can hire cheap drones off the market. And BTW, this is happening in 2011 when the industry is becoming mobile, html5/nodejs/mongodb are changing the game. The company I loved was becoming something else.
* So I stopped worrying about it, treated my job as just a job and nothing more. My relationships got better, I even decided to get married. But there is just one problem. I had to move to a different city closer to my hometown across timezones. Luckily my company has an office nearby, so I opted to work from there. New management was also very keen to get rid of me, as I didn't always agree with them(like we should focus on mobile/html5/node not on J2EE crap), so they readily agreed. At this point I was a team architect(for a 20+ team) and leading a major project/initiative which was in incubation.
* After getting married, I took a month off and went back to my new workplace. I found that I've been perfectly ambushed, was deemed ""unavailable""(owing to me getting married) and they gave my project to a new guy. I was asked to do shit jobs -- like setting up build scripts for that project, maintain the server farm which runs the build etc. Things which really fall under devops category. Now we are not talking about a lean bootstrapped startup, where developers are expected to do such things. This is now a big-ass company with 15 devops guys sitting in just my location. But our management couldn't book any of them in time, because they can't execute for shit.
* While this is dragging on, I ponder about quitting, but I can't really, because things are just settling down with my marriage and also I bought a new home now. So I decided to mellow out, keep quite for an year and look for other opportunities within my company. So, the annual performance ratings come around and I got royally screwed. It is so bad that an inter-company transfer is now out of the question, according to company policy.
* Meanwhile, my team that I helped build is getting dissolved and cannibalized, because that large project turned out to be an utter failure. They took 6000+ days to push code that had so many issues, it was not released to the customers. Also the new tech stack didn't support mobile devices(not a J2EE/JSP deficiency, it was a management decision). This was in 2012. So the management promptly spread the blame to the developers and gave themselves a round of promotions.
* I got absorbed/grabbed in to a new team, building a product no one really uses, but just embellishes the company's product portfolio. This team already has dev leads, so I was asked to work as a developer initially. After spending months with this team, I was quite happy, because now I can work with code after a long break and my teammates were nice people. I just had to deal with the pointy-haired boss and shitty management like everyone else does in the company now. 
* But it's becoming increasingly clear that they really don't need an architect role(which I was supposed to fulfill), they just need another code monkey. It looks like they lured me in with a false promise. And this team works insane hours, considering the product they are building(it won't even be remotely visible to our actual customers, not a money-making product). 90% of the work is just for the sake of it, and it's a really terrible codebase. Piss poor test coverage, zero code reviews and just hacks piled on hacks. Refactoring is a dirty word and this management would have none of it. You can't spend time writing unit tests, you need to develop ""features"" that you will throw away in the next iteration. So in some ways, this management is even worse than the previous one.

Am I exaggerating much?

If I have to quit this job, I have a few problems:

* If I want to stay in my current city, only two companies can afford me at my current pay scale. Even outside of my city, there are only a handful of companies that can match my pay scale.
* I took an interview in one of those companies recently. And ""discovered"" this raging hard-on our industry has for data structures/algorithms. Yep, I am a vain fool for not preparing in advance. When I was a noob at my current job, I got yelled at by a renowned C++ guru for hand-rolling my own binary search. I learned my lesson that day, so I really don't understand the need for asking the candidate to write code for rotating a red-black tree. I think the real purpose of these questions is to just set a bar, so that only candidates who actually spend a significant amount of time preparing for the interview can pass. Kind of like, testing if the candidate ""really wants it"". So it scares me to take up a job like that, because I am afraid I will end up in the same old situation -- where you end up washed out and working yourself to the bones.
* It increasingly looks like now or never, if I wanted to start something on my own. But I believe my skills are now really skewed to my current job. Whatever startup-streak I had in me left years ago, and I don't think I have even a single startup-worthy idea. I have 0 contacts in the startup circle, partly because of my recent migration. 
* I will be happy to take a pay cut and work for a lesser salary, if I can get that ideal ""good"" job: decent pay, flexible work hours, meaningful work and management which gets technology. Does that even exist? Most recruiters don't even call me after they see my current pay scale. How do I overcome that?

My core skills are Java, C++, Python and a little Ruby. If I quit my job now, I can pay off the house mortgage and can go on jobless for 6 months or so, thanks to the stock options. After that, I am fucked.

Thoughts?

TLDR: used to be a swell guy in a great company. Now shit-canned to a dark cesspool, and scared to go out on to the big bad world. Should I go outside and play? Or should I bide my time and wait?

During college I was dealing with depression, which negatively affected how I did in my courses, and resulted in me not pursuing internships or any type of job search stuff at all. I was one of those isolationist hermit-like depressives, but I've made a lot of progress in the past year and am feeling pretty good now. I also realized that I hated programming, but I felt trapped in my degree. I'm starting to look for jobs now, and I'm worried that if I take a job as a programmer all the progress I've made in dealing with my depression will go down the drain as I work a job I hate. However, my school really only helps students find jobs programming for reasons I don't fully understand. (I asked this question to my adviser, and she directed me to an online listing that was entirely made up of small-medium business programming jobs. It was a similar situation at the campus career fair.) 

I'm hoping someone can help me find what else is out there for someone in my situation. I still like the problem solving aspect of CS, and I particularly like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction, but don't know how to explore those outside of the research route. I could deal with a small amount of coding, but I think it's more something I would do a hobby than something I could make a career out of. I'm having a really hard time finding resources on the web, so if someone could suggest a few job titles to research, or even provide some links to resources for CS majors looking for jobs outside their degree I'd really appreciate it.

I'm looking for a job outside of programming, or even CS entirely. Hoping someone could suggest a place to start.

I ask because I want to save money to be able to go back to the states once I graduate and continue my studies to get a master's degree. I am a US citizen if that matters, but I live in a third world country so the jobs here aren't very good and don't pay much. Most of my knowledge comes from watching online courses from stanford and mit and other similar sources, because I feel that my university doesn't teach nearly as well.

I enjoy the math and programming, read supplemental material, and try to do whatever extra coding I can (Project Euler, for instance).

That being said, I'll be 30 when I get my degree, with no practical experience in the field. I've managed a convenience store while I've been in college; it's helped my pay my bills, but doesn't look so great on a resume. 

My school is a large public university. I go to a regional campus. We are under one large accreditation, so my degree will be from the main school, but I lack a lot of its resources. The professors here don't have the facilities to do much research, so assistants/aides are in low demand. Also, I've had trouble finding ANY internships, much less ones in my field. 

For one last kink, my fianceé is about to pursue her Ph.D. We will be moving out of state shortly after I finish my degree, and I am taking a heavy class load to keep on that schedule.

I'm a rising junior in CS. I'm interning this summer at my university doing some web development stuff (nothing special: CSS, HTML5, some PHP and jQuery here and there). The work is not stressful and even though I came in without knowing much about any of those technologies, I feel pretty comfortable (to an extent) with these now. The problem is that since I don't feel challenged - I feel like I'm wasting precious time at work (I complete my projects and tasks very quickly and everyone likes what I do). After work, I'm learning Android Development on my own and it's going pretty well and I *do* feel challenged there as I'm learning all the ins and outs of Android. 

Today, after I finished all my tasks for the day (weird, I know), I went to careercup.com and the first few questions (like finding a pair of integers with the largest interval from a set of integers) made me question myself whether I'm going in the right direction. Don't get me wrong, I could come up with an answer but then I looked at others peoples' solutions and they stupefied me. They were using techniques I could never think of myself. I want to note that I've already taken OOP and Algorithms courses already. 

So my question is, should I keep doing what I'm doing now (learning PHP, jQuery, Android) or should I focus more on learning how to solve interview questions? I feel like having something to show your interviewer (cool and useful Android apps, for example) is much more useful in the long run because I would have a useful skill; I would know how to make something that works on an Android device, while coding up solutions to interview questions (that no one will ever look at beyond the interviewer's office)  seems like the only way in to top-tier companies. Next summer, I want an internship at either some big firm located in NYC or a promising startup working on something I find interesting.  Ambitious goals. Yes.

I've been attending a local community college for CS for the past 2 years. For the past few months I've been interning as a software engineer at a local company and am pretty sure they're getting ready to offer me a full time salaried position (They made me a nameplate :P, and the other 2 interns that started with me were let go a month+ ago). I just got accepted into Rochester Institute of Technology's CS program as a transfer, but I'd still be considered a first year student, with about half a year done there. RIT is about 40k/year, and I've already got 30k in debt from previous college (I have a certificate degree in digital photography... aka a useless piece of paper). Their program is great though, very career oriented, even requiring 2 semesters +1 summer of co op. But I'd be coming out with somewhere between 150 and 200k in debt.

The final piece of the puzzle is my significant other. He currently works at the same company I'm interning at but really doesn't like it and wants to look for something more. He's said that if I decide to go to RIT he'd move out there with me and find a job out there. He's already got his BS so shouldn't have too much of an issue getting a job... On the other hand if I don't go to RIT *and* we don't stay at this company... I'll be following him wherever he gets a job and... I don't even know what then.. either searching and searching for a job with 6 months of experience and no relevant degree... or go back into retail (GOD NO!) while finishing up an associates at a community college wherever we end up.. And then either searching again for a relevant job, or.. be faced with this same decision and try to find a university to attend.

Honestly the place we live is pretty middle-of-nowhere and doesn't have many tech jobs.. if we lived in a more tech-oriented area I may have an easier time finding a job I'd qualify for.. but I don't really know..

Sorry for the big blob of text.. but I've got a week left to decide on RIT.. It's pretty stressful realizing you have a week to make a decision that could affect the next 4 years of your life.... well I guess the rest of my life really, with 200k worth of debt..

Moral of the story is you don't need a college degree to get a coding job.

I realize a lot of it depends on the person and what they want so here's the background information on me. I'm going to be entering my junior year in Software Engineering this fall. I like programming and do want to get a job in software development. I live in central Iowa and am unsure if I want to stay here or move after I graduate yet. I want to get a masters because I really like what I'm learning but it doesn't seem like my undergraduate degree will go deep enough and I want to learn more. I also partially want to do it for the higher salary, but not sure if its worth it for the year lost of working. If I did do a masters right now I'm thinking I would want to do it right after my bachelors, my college has a program where you can apply 6 credits of your undergrad to your grad degree if you get accepted to grad school and stuff, which sounds like a pretty good deal, since I would only have 26 credits left and could finish that in a year.

I am just afraid that if I choose to stay in Iowa, I won't benefit as much from having a masters or might even hurt my job prospects because potential employers won't want to pay more for a masters.

Hi, I’m Locke. I’ve seen this question posted ~20 times, including once by myself, to /r/cscareerquestions over the last 6 months or so. As I have just gone through the entire process, I’m here to guide you along the way and answer questions about your wonderful exciting summer of sitting inside for 40 hours a week.  

**The answer (If you just want to know):**  

Possibly, but probably not. In a nut shell, this is just the truth of the matter. Read the actual guide if you want to know why.  

**The Story (My journey towards a summer internship):**  
If you don’t actually want to read about me, I’ll try to parse out the relevant bits into a summary at the bottom, but I find this kind of thing much easier to explain in context.  

I am a freshman at the University of Georgia, which unless you follow SEC football, you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a large research University located in Athens, GA. Our primary research is in binge drinking, but we’re also known for our biology and medical research, and occasionally something fun in our very small CS department (~200 students). I’m in the Honors program, pursuing a Bachelor’s\Master’s crossover, to get both degrees in four years. (Hooray for 37 hours of AP credit!)  

 I started my search early, in early October, looking everywhere I possibly could for internships. I crawled through all of my favorite big tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. etc.) and found a few promising gems. First, is the [Google Freshman Engineering Practicum]( http://www.google.com/jobs/engpracticum/fep/), which is exactly what it sounds like. A 10 week internship out in Mountain View, CA. Next was  the [Explore Microsoft](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/internships-explore-microsoft.aspx) program, which similarly was a 12 week internship in Redmond, WA. Well now I was all excited, between these two tech giants, and the fact that I’m very smart, there’s gotta be something cool there right? Well, we’ll see.  

From there, I looked for whatever resources I could. I leaned on my parents, aunts, and uncles to possibly find me internships at their companies, or with the companies of friends. I sat down and crawled through hundreds of job postings on sites like [Dice](http://www.dice.com) and [Monster](http://www.monster.com) looking for internship postings in my area. Don’t look outside your area, unless they’re a big tech company (See above), they won’t pay for you to relocate for the summer.  

I found some decent success through these sites, and sent out [resumes](http://i41.tinypic.com/69dsi9.jpg) to everyone. Note, the translation to a .jpg in that got a little weird. Please give employers your resume in pdf format. Also, complete props to a post a few months ago that I shamelessly stole this resume format from.  

From there, I turned to my last two avenues of discovery. These are the ones that I’m going to have the least to tell you about, as they’re specific to your university. Your University’s career fair, and your University’s job website. I checked my career fair, and looked for CS companies. Well, we don’t have any. Shit. What about large companies that have big IT departments? Well, there are a fair number of those. So I got in my suit (You MUST wear a suit to a career fair) and went and talked to one or two of them.  

And finally, my University’s job site.  This was a gold mine for me. You could narrow it down to major, type of job (Internship versus full time) and then just mass email resumes.  

So first thing, fellow programmer, to do is to do everything I just listed above. This will take you a while. And then once you do it, you’ll have to do it again. As a general rule, I checked the University job site once every few days, from October until now. That’s important, because new jobs get submitted as time goes on. I had personally thought the recruiting process started in the fall, but from what I’ve seen it actually picks up in the spring.  

Oh! I just remembered. Here’s something unscrupulous I’ve done. If around where you live has a big tech school that you don’t go to, piggy back on their recruiting process. It’s probably open to anyone online. For example, I used Georgia Tech’s website to look as well as my own.  

Okay, so. After I did all that, I had the following list of companies that I had submitted some kind of literature to:  

- Google  
- Microsoft  
- IBM  
- AT&amp;T  
- HP  
- Chick-Fil-A  
- Home Depot  
- Lockheed Martin  
- ThyssenKrupp IT Services, North America  
- Verizon Wireless  
- McKesson Provider Technologies  
- ADP (Automatic Data Processing)  
- Sybase  
- Windham Brannon  
- Macy’s  
- MedAssets  

Don’t be surprised if you don’t recognize every name on the list, I submitted a resume to literally every company within driving distance of my house. Here’s the response I got back from them all.  

- Google: No  
- Microsoft: No  
- IBM: No  
- AT&amp;T: Originally no, and then I got a call from a random HR manager in March  
- *HP: Phone interview*  
- Chick-Fil-A: No  
- *Home Depot: Phone interview*  
- Lockheed Martin: No  
- *ThyssenKrupp IT Services: Phone interview, in person interview*  
- Verizon Wireless: No  
- McKesson: No  
- ADP: No  
- *Sybase: Phone interview*  
- Windham Brannon: No  
- Macy’s: No  
- *MedAssets: Phone interview, in person interview*  

So, yeah. Lesson here is learn to accept rejection, you’ll get it a lot. Of the companies who responded to me (Which was only about half of the “no”s, the rest didn’t even bother), most said that they weren’t interested in a freshman intern. Doesn’t matter my skill set or programming ability, they simply aren’t interested.  

The reason the companies gave me for this is that most companies use their internships as recruitment programs. Nobody is thinking four years down the road as far as hiring new recruits. They want new developers after the summer you work for them. This fucking sucks, but is the truth of the matter.  

Now, as for the interview process itself. I won’t say I’m an expert on interviews. But I did go through 6 interviews of one sort or another for an internship, so I’ll fill you in on my experiences.  

As a general note of things that were covered in every interview so I don’t repeat myself:  

*General questions:*  

- Tell me about yourself. – This question sucks. I’m sorry, it just does. I would generally respond “That’s a rather broad question, do you mean academically, programmatically, personally…? I’m not really sure what you’re looking for.” Until I realized that they always meant programmatically. Tell them about your programming background. Mine went something like this:  

“Okay, I’m a 1st year at UGA in the Honors program, doing an accelerated Bachelor’s Master’s program to get both degrees in four years. I began programming when I was 12 doing basic scripting stuff relating to IRC chat rooms (Editor’s Note: Yes, I know that the C stands for “chat”. They generally don’t.), and then from there branched out into basic JavaScript and began being interested in computer security. From there beginning just before high school I branched out into Java and C++ to learn more object oriented programming, and began working on larger projects. Since then I’ve been working on becoming familiar with Python, C#, and Ruby.""  
 
Invariably, this leads to the next question which I know all of you don’t like:  

- Tell me about a project you’ve worked on in the past that you were particularly excited about doing.  

I’ll be honest right here. I have past projects to draw on. If you don’t, make it up. That is probably unethical, but if you can talk about a project like you have worked on it, even if it never got out of the design stages, it still shows the level of interest they’re looking for.  

Anyway, my answer would either be “Oh well I’m excited about the Android app I’m working on right now” or “Well I made this bot to sit in chat rooms in middle school that ended up being by number of lines by far my biggest project” and then I would elaborate.  

This is an important question. Not only will they gauge your programming ability by the depth of the project you worked on, but they’ll gauge your interest in programming in general and the work they do. If you can figure out what they do ahead of time and tailor your story to make it seem like you really like their work, all the better.  

Technical Questions:  

- The definition of inheritance - Every, single, interview. Both phone and in person. I found this easiest to elaborate by saying the definition, and then giving an example.  
- The definition of polymorphism – See above  
- Some keyword question (For HP it was C#’s “protected”, for MedAssets it was C++'s “struct”, etc). Know your terminology.   
- Some kind of database question (How do you sanitize SQL inputs, what are the advantages\disadvantages of using this kind of database, etc.)  
- Some kind of data structure question. Not the same as above. This would be like, tell me why you would use an array over a linked list, and vica versa.   

In interviews in general, you need to be relaxed. I know this can be hard, especially if you’ve never interviewed before. My general advice here would be to talk to other people about programming. Talk to people who know more than you. Talk to a professor, a grad student, a senior who's about to work at Google or whatever. Find someone, and just talk to them about code. The interview will more or less be no different.  

Surprisingly, in all of the interviews I only got asked a few actual programming questions where I had to write code. They didn’t want syntax perfect, but they wanted it to be more refined than pseudo code. I know everyone hates this, but I have to do it for tests too. It’s best to just memorize your basic syntax. The questions I had to do by hand were the following:  

- Here is a 12X12 multiplication table. Write a program to output this table.  
- Modify the program above to work with any size table.  
- Modify the problem above so that if the number is divisible by three, output “fizz” instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by five, output “buzz”. (This is the classic fizzbuzz problem).  
- Write a program to take in a string and reverse it.  
- Let’s say I have an arbitrarily large linked list. What would you do to check if someone had looped the list back on itself (Pointed one of the pointers to an earlier node).    

All of these except the last one shouldn’t be particularly challenging to a second semester CS student. I was honestly very surprised with how easy the programming challenges were.  

From there, you’ll either get a call saying we would like you to come on or we wouldn’t. To conclude my story, I did get an internship! I won’t say with who in case one of you wants to stalk me, but I’m very pleased with it.  

**Miscellaneous information you might want to know:**

- In my research into internships, I got a decent grasp of what interns get paid. In New York and California the internships I looked at were at $30/hour. Around here in Atlanta, I’m getting paid $15/hour, and another one I tried to get was $18/hour. So, definitely good money, and scales based on where you live.  

- The big tech companies are the only ones who pay for relocation, so look for something in your area. Nevertheless, it’s awesome they do that.  

- Internships are generally between eight and twelve weeks, depending on where they are, and not particularly accommodating to your schedule. I’ll end up only working about 3/4ths of my summer right now, due to when their internship block of the summer is. Oh well.  

And that’s all I got! If you have any other questions or if I’ve left out something big from this guide, please either post here or PM me! I’m happy to share whatever knowledge I have.

My manager has decided that we should all be using Intellij as an IDE to develop with, and it is quite expensive.  There are three of us besides him.  So rather than have to ask and get approved to buy us 3 commercial licenses at $499 each, he has asked us (not in writing or really directly at all but he has said this will work and we are standardizing on Intellij) to instead purchase personal licenses at $199 each and submit for reimbursement from the company.  

Now when I went to do this, I saw that they are way ahead of us and the personal license is invalid if you are getting reimbursed by a company.  So we are basically going to be developing using unlicensed IDEs.  

By the way, this is a Fortune 500 company we work for.  This just seems like a bad idea to me, but I was wondering if you can fill me in on just how bad it is.  My biggest worry is, can I personally be sued if I develop for a company on a company laptop using an unlicensed IDE that I bought and then made invalid by accepting company reimbursement?

Thank you!

Now, to proceed with wall of text...

This is my first job out of college.  I got my BSCS in 2011, and have been working here since.

It's a small corporation (~125 people), whose bottom line is absolutely not software.

That makes me, (the only ""software/data guy"" in the whole company), an administrative expense.  A very thinly-stretched administrative expense.

I really don't mind the work, but the pay is not great, and given the number of hats I wear, I spend a very small amount of time actually coding.

A typical day might look like:

- Helpdesk type call where someone's excel macros are running unusually slowly.

- Creating SSRS reports for scheduling, business process visualization, etc.

- Sitting down with Accounts Receivable to figure out a way to streamline the ridiculous amount of data entry they do.

- Going on a witch hunt for a cause for low revenue figures for last month under management's orders.

- Ad hoc data pulls for someone who needs to tell a customer why deadline x isn't going to be met.

- Discussing the details of a ""new"" report which is really just a summary of 3 other reports.

- Explaining to Bob, VP of Corporate Bullshit that I can't create a report for data that nobody enters into the system at any point.

That probably sounded increasingly bitter, sorry.

I love coding.  I really just want to get into an actual programming job, and I feel like I'm more of a business analyst at this point.

But I'm not really sure where to jump in when companies require something like ""5 years C#.NET, SQL, jQuery, ASP.NET MVC, Python, SQL Server, JSON, AJAX, OOP best practices experience"" for a Junior Developer position.

I'm really hoping to get some outside perspective, and I apologize if that sounded overly bitter or whiny, just ready to move on!

So I graduated this year from a pretty good public university and had been trying to interview with plenty of big name companies (Goog, Msft, Amzn, FB, Salesforce) currently and in the past (for internships) and I've always come up short on the last interview before they make a decision.

Granted that, I've improved a significant amount each year so I know that I've made some mistakes in the past during my interviews.

This year however, I focused intensely on doing all these interview questions, practicing to think recursively, thinking before I code. I spend hours at a time just thinking about **how to think about a problem correctly**.

So I figured I had learned from all my mistakes...in the past, I just jumped to a half-decent answer and started coding it; giving some leisurely explanation for my code and then missing some corner cases. But now I learned that's the wrong way to do it. I need to show them my thought process, my carefulness, my skills. THIS TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

I came up with a method and I practiced this process in my head that seemed perfect to what the interviewers want (in this order):

1) Get clarity!! Don't solve the wrong problem and get rid of any ambiguity!!

2) Write test cases; positive scenarios, error scenarios, corner case scenarios.

3) Make the appropriate sanity checks; **N.E.S.S.** (nulls, erroneous input, same-ness, size/length check).

4) Will a data structure help? Try a: HashMap, HashSet, Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue, List, array[], Tree, Recursion.

5) Write out the pseudo-code in comments first and then code it. BUT make sure to tell them that you will write code after!!

I took an incredibly cautious and careful approach to my interview, I made sure to minimize bugs in the code and try for the most optimal-time solution. Amazon seems to love HashMaps so the first thought that came to mind in any question was to try to use it. Today I found out that I didn't get the offer yet again, only this time it was for full-time.

I've tried to just jump to AN answer and that didn't work. I've tried to take it step by step, very slowly because ""the thought process is what matters, not getting the right solution"". Yet neither has given me an offer. I want to go to Seattle and I'm interviewing with other big names in the area but I'm limited by the number of people who can refer me and posting my resume online to places has not yet helped me.

1347894271.0,25,self.cscareerquestions,100wdf,"TALK!  It's An Interview, Not An Interrogation",fecak,29,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/100wdf/talk_its_an_interview_not_an_interrogation/,"Several times a year I will get a call or email from a hiring manager telling me that an interview never really ‘went anywhere’ because the candidate seemed either unwilling or unable to dive very deep into technical topics.  It can be impossible for an interviewer to accurately gauge whether the cause was a lack of tech skills or just an inability to communicate those skills, but it really makes no difference as the end result is a rejection.  This observation is probably a bit more prevalent during phone screens, where the parties do not have the advantage of proximity and body language to assist.

Whenever I hear feedback like this from clients, I imagine what the interview may have sounded like:

INTERVIEWER:  Have you worked with Ruby on Rails before?

CANDIDATE:  Yes, I have.

INTERVIEWER:  Could you elaborate on that a little bit?

CANDIDATE:  Yes, I could.

INTERVIEWER:  (VISIBLY ANNOYED)


It brings to mind the old joke (which of course reinforces gender and programmer stereotypes):

&gt; A wife asks her computer programmer husband, “Go to the store and get a gallon of milk, and if they have eggs get a dozen.”  A short time later the programmer returns with twelve gallons of milk.  She asks, “Why did you get twelve gallons of milk?” and he responds, “They had eggs.”

In the short two question interview scenario above, the candidate is answering the questions being asked, and the candidate is providing all the information that was being requested.  If you look at the questions in a literal manner (as many engineers tend to do), this candidate may not feel he/she is being dodgy at all.  Just as the programmer in the joke did what his wife asked (by his literal interpretation).

Let’s now look at a brief example of a police interrogation:

INTERROGATOR:  Where were you on the night of the 8th?

SUSPECT:  At home.

INTERROGATOR:  Were you by yourself?

SUSPECT:  No

INTERROGATOR:  Who was with you?

SUSPECT:  My husband.

INTERROGATOR:  WHO WAS WITH YOU??!!

SUSPECT:  My lover!  (CUE SCARY MUSIC)


These answers provide the minimum amount of information the interrogator requested, and a lawyer will probably advise you to keep your answers short and precise during questioning.  The interrogator’s job is to get a suspect to say something that he/she does not want to reveal.

**A job interview is not an interrogation**, and it is important for candidates to be sure they are not treating it as such.

Keep in mind that interviews, particularly in technology settings, can be awkward situations for participants on both sides of the table.  Most interviewers are at least slightly uncomfortable being placed in a room with a complete stranger for the sole purpose of judging him/her in order to reach some conclusion about whether he/she should be hired, a decision which could greatly impact the life of at least one party (the candidate) or even both parties (if the hire is made).  If an interviewer gives even a small consideration that this stranger may have a family that depends on the income that the job would provide, the potential for an awkward exchange is even more likely.

Most interviewers want to get a dialogue flowing, where the discussion will allow them to evaluate your technical and interpersonal skills.  They want to control and moderate the conversation, but they would like to listen more than they speak.  The candidate’s ability to communicate his/her thoughts will be apparent after a few questions.  At some point most interviewers have to ask themselves, “Would I want to work next to this person every day for several years?”  If the candidate answered their questions in a fashion resembling the Candidate or the Suspect in the samples above, the answer is always “No”.

Some candidates may argue that they have answered the questions as asked, and that if the interviewer wanted more details he/she should have inquired for them specifically (*“Tell me about Ruby on Rails experience.”*).  This is a valid observation, but it doesn’t solve the problem.  It’s purely a function of conversational English, and it is one reason that chatbots with artificial intelligence may give answers like our Candidate did in the example.

*So, I’ll just keep talking and talking to solve the problem?*  NOPE.  There is also the possibility that if a candidate answers every question with a long-winded response, he/she may be rejected for not being able to provide succinct answers.  Managers are often unwilling to hire someone who they feel is unable to express themselves efficiently, and in the case of software engineers you may hear, “Being that chatty, I can’t imagine what his/her code (comments) looks like!‘

**How do I appear to be open, honest, and transparent without sounding chatty?  How do you avoid being labeled as unable or unwilling to answer interview questions?**


* Don’t take every question literally – Remember that a good interviewer is trying to engage you in a dialogue and an exchange of ideas.
* Pause before answering – Some candidates seem programmed to immediately start talking after a question is asked, and then find that they haven’t really answered the question.  Taking a moment to reflect on the question and to organize your thoughts gives the appearance that you are making an effort to supply a strong answer and that you are not impulsive.  A little white space does not have to be an uncomfortable silence.
* Pause after answering -  If the interviewer does not respond with a follow-up after a few seconds, he/she may be waiting for you to go deeper.  Ask if he/she is satisfied with your answer and offer to continue with more information if necessary.  “Would you like some more details on that?“
*Ask questions to clarify what type of answer is expected – If you are asked a question where there could be both an acceptable short answer (yes/no) or a longer answer (details), give the short response and offer the interviewer more.  “Yes, I have used Ruby on Rails.  Would you like me to discuss my experience further?“
* At the end of the interview, ask the interviewer if they have any other questions that will help them make their decision. Invite them to contact you in the coming days if any additional information is required or if they would like any clarification on the answers you provided.

Go into the interview with the goal of having a conversation which should put the interviewer at ease.  Be willing to follow the interviewer into any direction the discussion may take, and ask questions so you know that you are on the same page.

I had an internship and a good GPA, but I didn't do much programming outside of class. I also never really mastered topics like algorithms and operating systems. I ended up taking a job that was billed as programming and system administration, which was also new to me. I went on autopilot for years and didn't really think about my career until the last few years, when I realized that my job has become less and less programming. My only programming now is modifying a few lines of code in an existing program, reading source code, or writing a one-off script to automate something. My typical day is modifying some software configuration, swapping hard drives, doing a backup, or trying to fix some Linux problem.

I'm now in a situation where I don't have much real programming experience, and I haven't really developed my sysadmin skills beyond what is necessary for the job, nor do I really like doing administration or working with hardware. My resume apparently still looks impressive because I get contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn for programming jobs, but I don't have the confidence to actually get through a technical interview. 

I'm trying to rectify the situation by working on a side project that has potential to be monetized and will let me learn new frameworks, and taking online courses like on Coursera and Udacity.

Background: I'm a few years out of school in my mid twenties and I decided to interview with Amazon after receiving a message from a recruiter on LinkedIn. After going through their process I received an offer to work on a growing/cool part of their business. 

I currently work in a pretty good job, it is not for a glamorous company like Amazon but I work with smart people and I really like the management. I have done very well in my current position and management is steering me into more technical leadership type roles going forward.

The offer was fairly generous (salary + large bonus + large stock award). My current company offered to match 95% of the salary I was offered but can't match the incentives.

At first when I received the offer I was really excited to start working at a place like Amazon but after reading through all of the reviews on glassdoor it seems like it might not be the best place to work as far as work life balance, career growth, raises and management goes. I know I have to take the glassdoor reviews with a grain of salt but even the positive glassdoor reviews for Amazon mention that they overwork and burn out employees.

So my choice basically boils down to my current job (less money, stability, technical leadership potential in the short term) Vs. Amazon (more money, starting over professionally, cool products, potentially difficult work environment, some risk). I do not need to relocate. 

Any advice on what to do? Most people I have talked to haven't had any specific advice other than it will probably be OK either way.

But it seems society as a whole does not actually show the computer science field the respect that, say, Doctors, Lawyers, and even Architects are given. You do not hear many “average” people say how much they want to go to college to be a programmer when they graduate high school. I know computer science is a relatively new field and it covers a vast amount of jobs, but I think it deserves more respect. I am not saying people are showing the field absolutely no respect, but it seems like people think of people in CS as just computer nerds. I am not sure if you all agree with me on this or not, but I would like to hear what you guys think is the reason why CS is sometimes overlooked by society. 

**Edit:** I feel like I need to add this into the description: I am not trying to say CS receives zero respect, I am saying I don't feel it receives an appropriate amount of respect. I think CS should be perceived by society to be as respectable or very closely respected as the medical and law fields.

The last two companies I worked at had one senior dev who had been there the longest and had built a lot of the tech we used. I had a huge amount of respect for their smarts and experience, but they were very... I would say egotistical about it. I got talked down to a lot and made fun of, mostly in a playful way but it still sucked to be treated like an inferior developer and person in general. At these two companies, they oversaw all deployments and would nitpick the smallest things. It was annoying, but manageable. I really enjoyed those two jobs aside from this.

Fast forward to now. I started at a new company about a month and a half ago, also rather small. There's a senior dev here who is IMPOSSIBLE to get along with. He handles everything: sysops, product development, and reviews all of our code. He has ZERO tolerance for any of us. We get paid well, but it really feels like emotional abuse sometimes. I've already gotten into verbal fights with him, in which our boss has to act as a peace keeper. He's basically said that I ask too many questions, and I should ""go read a fucking manual"" instead of coming to him for every little problem I have. He often links me to that ""go google it yourself"" site as a response when I ask him stuff over chat. The thing is, I don't come to him *that* often, and when I do it's for stuff that I feel I can't just Google. Its for software he either wrote or production configurations I want to pick his brain about. Or sometimes I want him to just get his opinion on a matter--like do you think it would make sense to use this pattern here? Is there a better way to do this? I ask him this after I've written code. He seems to think that us asking him any question at all is challenging his giant intellect or something, and he's openly expressed he feels no responsibility to help us out. He just wants to be left alone.

Also, nothing I submit is good enough anymore by his standards. My code ""lacks experience"", and there's always a ""far better"" way to do it he tells me. He often calls my code ""novice shit"" and demands I rewrite it... Which is irritating beyond belief. A couple of times already I've had to rewrite stuff over the weekend because of his comments. Usually when I ask him what exactly is wrong with my code, he can't explain it. He says vague things like ""this won't perform well in production"" or ""you're not approaching the problem in a smart way.""

I've talked to my boss about it, and he says he knows our senior dev is a difficult person to work with. He's very much of the mentality that in order to get good, you have to do everything by yourself. It's the only way to understand everything exceptionally well, and I should listen to him.

I'm considering leaving, but I want to know...

I always thought that senior devs were supposed to be mentoring and nurturing, helping you grow and also helping you understand why they choose to do the things they do. They have a lot of experience, and I know not all experience can be explained when its intuition... But Christ, is this normal?

This lady started  of by asking me questions about what the latest version of the admin console of the Websphere application server looked like and what buttons you needed to click to set up JMS. When I gave her an overview of how you needed to create a SIB(service integration bus) etc. she cut me short and said that wasnt what she was looking for. Next she talked about how ANT was over MAVEN and then went on about why you should not use MAVEN. By this point I was a little irritated but kept going. 
Next she asked me about what type of development we did in my last project. When I said it was Waterfall SDLC she freaked out and said I had not worked on an AGILE environment. I told her I had in my previous projects but she thought it was unacceptable and I should have convinced my last client to go AGILE. 
Anyway her last question was what threw me off. She asked me about my design documentation/UML skills and I told her about how I used UML for Class Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams and Component Diagrams. So she went ahead and asked me to name all the type of UML diagrams. At this point I lost it and asked her if she was looking for a java developer or a business analyst because not one of her questions were questions that really tested my coding skills.

The only question I was asked was related to a stack, and how I would implement it. However, the question the interviewer posed was pretty vague, and I still think it was impossible to implement, given the constraints.. I provided my solution in a Java language context.

**Describe a stack, and how you could implement it**

Basic abstract data structure where elements can be added to it, and ""popped"" by retrieving the last added element (LIFO). Can be implemented by using a linked list (I didn't go into other implementations - could this be why?) by modifying the first node and its pointers when pushing and popping.

**(Now - the hard part) Given two methods, push and pop, implement a method (say, getMin) that finds the smallest element in the stack, with the contraint that push and pop must run at contant time.**

Now, the contraint that the methods must remain in constant time did me in. Initially, I came up with a naive approach that iterated though the stack and kept track of the smallest element encountered, then returned the value when the last node was examined. This was just to get a sense of what kind of answer he was looking for. He then said that the solution wouldn't scale if the stack was large enough, and to come up with a faster approach.

The most cleaver approach I could come up with was modifying push and pop to add the elements to an auxiliary TreeMap object, with the key corresponding to the element, and the value corresponding to the number of times it appeared in the stack. Calling pop would then also decrement the value of that key in the TreeMap, and calling the getMin function would return the first key in the TreeMap (because keys are kept in their natural order).

However, I believe this solution would modify the push and pop methods to O(lg n), because keys are stored in a red-black tree in the TreeMap. Ultimately, the interviewer didn't mention whether or not this solution was what he was looking for, because I had pretty much run out of time.

Anyone out there have a solution? Thanks!",,False,,t5_2sdpm,1364307448.0,,,True,t3_1b1i6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1b1i6k/amazon_phone_screening_question_i_still_dont/,

Now, I have few ideas that I want to try. Some are about building web apps and some about Mac apps.

Here is the problem. I think most employers prefer a guy who is an expert in X if they need a guy for X. They ignore his experience and interest in Y and Z. 

So, say, I put few months in building a web app. It will help me learn about web technologies but it will not be enough to make me an expert web developer. No matter how much I play with web in my free time, I won't be able to compete with a guy who has been doing web development for couple of years. 

On the other hand, if I put my free time in playing and toying with Cocoa, I will get better in OSX ecosystem. But then I will not be a well rounded developer. 

I am divided. One of my colleagues that I consulted says it's better to explore new vistas. This will help you adept quickly to new frameworks and languages. This makes sense to me, I like it. But a part of me is worried that it will effect my resume, at least it will not add value to my resume if it doesn't effect it negatively. Because, I will apply at my next job as a Mac developer not as a web developer.

I would like to renegotiate my current salary($50k) but don't know what i'm worth to my company. 

I have a non CS degree from an SEC school. I live in Dallas, TX. While in college i taught myself PHP/HTML/JS/CSS and put together some web apps. After college i took a real estate job and worked for a year. Hated it and decided i'd like to see if i could land a job doing what i enjoyed, programming. 

My current employer heard my story, looked at my web projects i had been working on and could see i had a passion for this so they gave me a job for $45k starting out. I can't really blame them, they were just looking for someone to do some HTML/PHP tweaks to existing code. 

As time passed i started becoming more involved in core PHP stuff. I started teaching myself TDD after hours. (We don't do any sort of automated testing...trying to change that). 

My boss asked me if i was at all interested in developing for mobile. I was and we started debating native vs html/js(phonegap) apps. They decided we should try phonegap for times sake. I came up with something but the performance sucked. I started teaching myself Java/Android after work at home. I came up with an Android prototype of our app that did almost everything we needed it to do. I showed/surprised my boss, he was impressed, and we've been going down the native route ever since. I'm the only one doing mobile dev. I'm the only one that knows Android.  We have 5 programmers out of a total of 8 people in the company. I've also JUST been told i'll be doing the first iteration for the iPhone app. I was under the understanding that our lead developer was planning on learning/coding that. Which means my boss thinks it would have been a good investment to use our lead guys time/hourly rate to code it. He won't be doing that simply because of the amount of work he already has.

My boss was so impressed by my Android app that he's thinking about applying for a patent for something i'm doing in it. I don't think there's any way in hell that it'll get approved, i don't think it's unique enough, but there's that. 

He's already mentioned that as the company grows, he sees me as taking the leadership role of mobile dev. 

Everybody also trusts me with core PHP code. I was talking with my fellow programmer, who's been with our company for 11 years about how slow our code is and how we both think we should rewrite it and he definitely likes the idea and said that if we(him and me) had two months to solely work on that, he believes we could come up with something much faster/better. Him saying that shows me the amount of trust he has in my abilities. 

I believe all of the programmers respect me as a programmer and even come to me for ideas about how to structure certain things if they're stuck or need a fresh perspective.

1360792172.0,21,self.cscareerquestions,18gyep,"CS student here. Depressed. Under qualified. Confused. Desperately need your help, Redditors. ",surfer17,30,9,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18gyep/cs_student_here_depressed_under_qualified/,"Background:
--------------
I will be graduating next year from a CS program from one of the top 5 universities in Canada. Its depressing for me to say that despite having a really good cumulative average in my program, a relatively decent grasp of the theoretical concepts we are taught in school, and a 16 month internship experience with a multi-national software firm, I don't think I'm worth anything and so will not be able to find a job after I graduate.

Let me clarify what I've said above: 
1) While its one of the top 5 universities in the country, apparently all the universities in that list have the same quality of education or 'training' that they impart to undergrads.
2) Yes, I have been a lazy bum when it comes to talking to professors about research opportunities they could provide me with, or in general networking with them - learning more about the course outside of the curriculum. I am not a scholar. Not one who'd think about going to grad school and doing research. I am one who sticks to school curriculum, does well, and parties the time he's left with. I realize that this habit of mine is possibly one of the bigger reasons or probably THE reason, why I think I'll be a failure after I graduate.
3) The 16 month internship experience I've had with the software firm has been that of a Test Associate intern. This is one of the decisions I regret most in my life until now (I know there are many more to come). I was offered 4 developer position internships and 2 test associate internships. I chose the internship of the testing position because of the money and the name of the software firm. And believe me when I say this, I really needed the money (no, not for parties. for family related issues). When I was deciding on which internship to choose, I knew I should go with the developing positions, but should I have gone with them, I wouldn't have been able to finish school.

I believe that internships are the best way to start off your career and a great opportunity for those who can get these. I faltered here big time. 

Now, coming back to my original point: 
--------------------------------------------
I'll be graduating in slightly over a year. And I believe that 1 year can be a relatively long period of time to set things right if one really wants to.

But here's my problem, I don't know how to do this. I know what I want. I want to be able to sell myself in a year from now to potential employers on how I could make a difference to their firm. Basically, get them to hire me. 

I'm not great with any particular technology. I have had some experience with a few of them. Nothing that would dazzle anyone. I know people without CS degrees have better experiences and work than I do.

Under web development, I have come across technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL. My experience here limited to creating a simple website I made.
Under core development, I have come across technologies such as Java, Python, C++. But my experience here is limited to school assignments extending up to a writing a few classes.
Under app development, I have developed a couple android apps. No exposure to iOS.
Under testing practices, I have written a few shell scripts and dealt with some automation testing. Nothing useful here.

I haven't ever worked with Open Source. Never had experience with GIT and open source projects on github. This, I hear is a very good way to expose yourself to real world problems and real world programming. However, I really don't exactly know where to start with this. Which projects to contribute to. How to contribute. I know what you're thinking.. its sad, I know. But that's why I need your help..

I have heard and read a lot about TopCoder. Apparently, you do well in topcoder competitions, gain a good rating and you can easily get hired by some top software firm. I don't know if this is really true. The problems on top coder are based on your knowledge of algorithms. I don't know if this is really worth the time and effort that will be put in to it. If just having a good rating, which obviously isn't guaranteed before hand, will do it for you.

I don't know if I should go about making some kind of web app or a phone app myself and bank on that.

TL;DR
-------
I don't know how I should spend the last year before I graduate to make myself sellable to firms, so that they hire me. I have no experience with open source, top coder. Don't have any fancy projects. Don't have advanced development experience. Just whatever one learns in school curriculum. These days, that doesn't seem to be enough.

Please tell me whether putting all my time in Top Coder can be worth it. Why? 

Or please tell me if I should start contributing to Open Source projects. If so, how? And what I can gain from it. 

Or please tell me if I should disregard the previous options and go about making some personal project of my own. If so, please tell me which technologies should I look to be working with? As there seem to be countless of them out there!

I'm currently making 65K in a high cost-of-living area that is NOT a hot spot for technology firms. I code almost exclusively in Ruby/Rails, PHP/CodeIgniter, SQL, and JavaScript. I've slowly gained proficiency with Git. Roughly half the time I am architecting/coding, and half the time I am pounding out HTML/CSS for static brochureware sites. I'd like to make more more money while doing more challenging/interesting work, but I don't know where to start. I have an excellent academic record (math major with many CS credits, 3.9+ GPA), GRE scores, and recommendations, so I am confident that I could be admitted to a great CS master's program. On the other hand, there is the tuition and opportunity cost to consider.

I feel like there are a number of practical languages/tools/skills worth knowing that I could teach myself - shell scripting, .NET, Python, Node.js, MongoDB, machine learning techniques, natural language processing techniques, etc. That said, it's one thing to read about a subject and another thing to have experience with it, which structured coursework provides. So, on to the concrete questions:

1. What programming skills/knowledge should I develop to increase my earning potential and make me competitive for more interesting jobs?

- C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- Visual BASIC

And by entry-level stuff, I mean all the really beginner stuff. Stuff that is required for the /r/DailyProgrammer ""easy"" challenges.

My last attempt at programming, which ended a month ago, I got further than I ever have before, using C#.

I got into OOP and creating classes, then creating ""objects"" which are reflections of that class with unique characteristics. As far as I understand, that's one of the major ""real"" parts of programming nowadays, so I was pretty proud to have gotten that far.

Then, I stopped. I don't know why, I never know why, I guess I just kind of.... burn out. One day I'd rather play a game. The next day I'm busy, etc.... and a cycle starts where I slowly program less and less, until I'm no longer programming at all.

Actually, I can think of why I stopped a couple times, including this last one. I ran into something I couldn't wrap my head around. I tried and tried and tried, read resources, asked for help in IRC, etc, and despite all of this I still couldn't understand it. So I said ""my brain needs a break"" and left it alone... which slowly lead to dropping it a month ago.

What makes this infuriating is simply the fact that, every time I DO come back to programming, I've forgotten most of what I wrapped my head around the time before!

I want to do this as a career (starting college next fall), and the many times I've tried and failed to get deep into programming makes me worried. 

Note: I LOVE programming. This is what I don't understand. When I work on a project, work through many brain-crunching issues, until it finally comes together... that is one of my favorite feelings in the world, and it's something I've only found through programming... but for some reason, apparently that isn't enough to keep me with it for more than a month at a time.

&gt;**Common Misconceptions**

&gt;That computer science majors make tons of money.  The lesson to be learned here is that compensation is equivalent to work.  Ideally, you are worth your salary - it's not so much that you are making megabucks but you are due worthy compensation for a painfully acquired skillset.

&gt;Unfortunately, the market dynamics force any skillset to be valued by the number of other people who also know it, and by how rigorously you know and pursue the compensation you deserve.  As far as things goes, the programming skillset is not the most difficult kind of knowledge, and the market values the true gems of the skillset (documentation, proper style, process specification, etc) far less than the programmer does — out of proportion with the effort required to acquire the skillset.  I hate to say it, but in many ways, it is better to learn to program from some cheap books — unless you feel you need the computer science degree to certify you in some way.

&gt;A final misconception I can think of is the “job lifetime”.  Many people thing that computer science majors are worth a lot and always employable.  This is not the case.  More so than other majors, the computer science major is trained on the “latest” technology and programming languages, and when those change — as they commonly do every 5 years, the computer science major's specific programming knowledge is outmoded, and he/she is generally fired for the new hot-shot college CS grad who knows the new languages and technology well, and does *not* know how much he/she is worth.  i.e.  They can be paid less for more.  CS is a really dangerous major to take out large loans on.  You can almost guarantee a few years employment though — maybe not job security, but a good few years in general.

1344883397.0,22,self.cscareerquestions,y5o63,Blind Dating for Geeks:  Questions Candidates Should Ask (and when to ask them) During Interviews,fecak,26,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y5o63/blind_dating_for_geeks_questions_candidates/,"After a few ‘Questions Candidates Ask In Interviews’ themed articles appeared in my Twitter stream, I was reminded of an article I wrote two years ago called ‘Best Questions To Ask The Interviewer, And When To Ask Them‘.  I think one key element missing in the new articles is the ‘when to ask them’ detail that I feel is incredibly important.  Also, being that JobTipsForGeeks is aimed at technology professionals, there are some nuances that do not apply to other industries.

Why is the timing of when the questions are asked important?  An interview is nothing more than a blind date, with the goal on both sides being to find out if you want to start seeing each other in a somewhat committed fashion.  You want to discover as much as you can about the other party, but first you have to set a positive tone and build trust. We surely would want to find out if our blind date is, say, a serial killer – but leading off with the ‘Are you a serial killer?’ question would seem rude, and we probably wouldn’t get an honest answer anyway.

Below is a list of the best questions to ask in chronological order.  Please keep in mind that you would need to restart from the beginning for every new person that you meet in situations where you meet with multiple participants individually.  You may not be afforded the opportunity to ask all the questions based on time constraints, so use at least one question from the first section for each person and try to use all the questions at least once at some point in the process.
Setting a positive interview tone
OR
Cocktails and light conversation

Question: “What is your background and how did you come to work for COMPANY?”
Reason to ask it:  Most people genuinely like to talk about themselves (those that do not share this trait will probably not be in the interview), so give them a chance to do so. Don’t be afraid to toss in some remarks and perhaps a follow-up question regarding their background if appropriate.  You may learn that you have some shared history with this person that could give you a potential ‘in’.

Question: “What do you like best about your job and about working for COMPANY?”
Reason to ask it: This question serves two purposes. First, it gives the employee the opportunity to speak well of the company, which again will give an initial positive vibe to your dialogue. Secondly, what the employee chooses to say they like best can be quite telling. If their answer is ‘environment’, ‘work/life balance’ or ‘the people’, that is a universal positive. If the response is ‘the money’ or ‘vacation time’, you may want to dig deeper to find out why.

BONUS Question:  (If possible, find a fairly recent newsworthy item about the company that is both appropriate and positive, and ask an insightful question about it)
Reason to ask it:  This shows that you have done your homework before the interview and that you want to be taken seriously as a candidate.  This is something that you want to fully research to prevent making a huge mistake that would make recovery impossible.
Discovery
OR
Gentle interrogation of your date during dinner

Question: What are the biggest challenges you face?
Reason to ask it: The reason for using the word ‘challenges’ is that it does not have a negative connotation, whereas asking someone for the ‘worst’ element of their job will not give a positive impression.  The answer here will start to create an image of what this company is going through today and what the landscape is for tomorrow.  At a start-up, you may hear answers about financial challenges, limited resources and a fast pace.  Some industries are known for heavy regulation getting in the way of progress.  This is all valuable information.

Question: What would the typical day be like for me at COMPANY?
Reason to ask it: You may get an answer that gives you tangible insight into work/life balance (‘I usually get home in time to watch Jimmy Fallon’), how much of your day may be spent coding or doing other duties, how many meetings you may be pulled into, etc.

Question: What was your career path here and what is a typical career path for my role at COMPANY?
Reason to ask it: Find out if they promote from within and if there are separate technical and non-technical/pure management tracks.  Will you be forced into a management role?

Question: How would you describe the environment?
Reason to ask it:  Asking an open-ended question like this could lead in several directions.  You should be able to ascertain if it is cut-throat or cooperative, how much support is given to technologists, and whether you will be expected to work with teams or as a solo entity.

Question: Management styles? Development processes and methodologies in place?
Reason to ask it:  Engineers preferences for structure vary greatly.  Be sure to drill down to get the best understanding of whether their practices are aligned with your views.

Question: Tech stack?
Reason to ask it: If their answer is a list of products and technologies that are severely dated, it could mean the company doesn’t invest in or even investigate the latest and greatest.  Conversely, if they seem overly concerned with bleeding-edge, perhaps they are making tech decisions based on cool factor more than quality.  Be sure to listen for what can be telling patterns, such as an abundance of tools from a particular vendor or a wide variety of open source tools.  This question also gives you an opening to discuss your experience (and preferences) relevant to their stack.

Question: Why is this position open?
Reason to ask it: Growth or promotion are the two most desirable answers. Perhaps this position is a launching board into higher level positions, or maybe it is a dead-end that will burn you out.
Closing the deal
OR
Last call and the drive home)…

Question: What qualities/background do you think would be key to making someone successful in this position?
Reason to ask it: During that last set of questions, some negative topics could have surfaced.  This gets things back on the positive side before the end, as well as giving you more info on whether you would be hitting the ground running or may require some learning curve. (NOTE: This question could also be used as an ice breaker early on)

Question: What projects are just getting ramped up or are on the horizon?
Reason to ask it: Interviewers will enjoy discussing new endeavors that they think you will find most interesting. If they talk about fixing bugs and maintenance, chances are that is what you will be doing in this job for the foreseeable future.  Ideally, the interviewer’s excitement should be palpable.

Question: Where do you see yourself in five years here at COMPANY?
Reason to ask it: This question is generally asked of candidates, so turning that around should provide insight into how he/she really feels about the firm and their prospects. Again, it lets the interviewer talk about himself/herself again in a positive fashion, and if the interviewer has a sense of humor expect an attempt to use it on this question.
The Conclusion
OR
Goodnight

Question:  Is there anything else I can answer for you or any more information I can provide to help you in your decision?
Reason to ask it:  It shows you are forthcoming and trying to be helpful.

Question:  I am very interested in this opportunity (or similar sentiment).  When do you expect COMPANY might be making a decision?
Reason to ask it:  Showing interest is vital, and asking about their timing could lead to information on other candidates.  It also may prompt them to ask about your availability to start, which is an obvious buying sign.  You want to do this is with as little pressure as possible.

Close by thanking the interviewer for taking the time to speak with you and tell him/her that you look forward to the next steps.  Good luck.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,t3_y5o63,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y5o63/blind_dating_for_geeks_questions_candidates/,

I graduated in May with a BS in Computer Science.  Since I graduated in May, I have been applying to 5-7 places every week. I have applied to over 100 places, which isn't that many at all but I usually take some time to apply to places that feel like a good fit for me instead of just blindly applying to every job I find.  Should I be applying to more places, even ones I might not be qualified for?

For the most part, I have been finding jobs via linkedin, indeed.com, dice.com, and my schools job board.  For almost all of these I am sending an email with a cover letter and my resume attached.

I have been getting some interviews, maybe 1 every week though all of them have been phone or skype interviews.  I tend to do well in interviews except for algorithms questions.  I try my best to talk through my problem solving process but I tend to blank out and then have the solution come to me the second the interview is over which is really frustrating. So far I have only had one offer and it was only for 45k, which I am going to reject because that is way too low.

What else should I be doing?  Is sending emails a waste of time? I do a little bit of programming in my free time and I have a few things I can show but its nothing that special.  I could probably find some open source project to contribute to but I have no idea what I want to do or what is going to help me the most.  My specialization for my degree was in computer graphics so I have tried applying to game development jobs.  I have built a few games as part of my undergraduate course work which I show to them, but I haven't gotten interviews with any game development studios which I applied to.  On the other hand, I hear so many negative things about the game industry and I don't know if its for me.  I just don't care about video games anymore as well.

Most places that have rejected me and gave a reason said that I just didn't have enough experience.  I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months so I have something but I don't really want to do web development.  I also worked as a intern at a pretty big company, but it was such a terrible experience that I wouldn't want to pursue a career there. 

tl:dr basically, I feel like I am at square one and I am not sure what I should be doing.  I keep applying to places, getting an interviews here and there, but I am getting no where.  I am not sure what I want to do with CS or if I even want to do software development.  I feel stuck because I have this degree and its my best chance at finding a job and i'm getting no where.

Technical interview where interviewer stubbornly gets Big-O wrong,TechThrowaway42,23,4,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ilh7o/what_to_do_technical_interview_where_interviewer/,"Have you ever been turned down because the interviewer got a Big-O concept wrong but thought *you* were the idiot?

So I was interviewing onsite at an impressive-seeming startup in San Francisco.  I was to be interviewed by five people.  The first two went pretty well.  On the third I was given a word count problem (count all occurrences of each word) and soon came up with this:

    def word_count_time(s):
        words = s.split()  # ""Don't worry about efficiency here""
        out_dict = {}
        for word in words:
            # is_letter(c) assumed to be implemented; filters out punctuation
            cl_word = """".join([c.lower() for c in word if is_letter(c)])
            if cl_word in out_dict:
                out_dict[cl_word] += 1
            else:
                out_dict[cl_word] = 1
        return out_dict

 So far, so good.  Then he asked for the run time.  I said that it would depend on the details of how the splitting is done, whether or not it has to build up a list by iterating over the entire list so far each time it adds an item.  So he said to ignore that step and give the run time of the rest.  I said it has to run through each character once so it would be O(n), n being the length of the input string.

That's where it got messy.  He insisted that it must be O( n^2 ) because I have a nested for-loop.  I then asked what he was taking to mean ""n"" here, and pointed out that if n is the number of characters, it still only has to look at each one once (times a constant factor), even if it's iterating within an iteration.  He was adamant, however, that a nested for-loop is necessarily O( n^2 ).  I tried to give reasons why this isn't like typical cases of nested loops, and diagrammed why it only does one (or a constant number of) pass(es) through the string.

After a little more back-and-forth, I asked him what kind of evidence would change his mind.  He said ""if the problem didn't have a nested for loop"" ... which wasn't quite was I was looking for.  At that point, I was pretty sure he was just really confused, so I suggested we run the problem with increasing problem size and look at how it scales.  He preferred debate.

Just to verify my sanity, I later ran the problem with increasing problem size.  Not surprisingly, here are the results.  Like clockwork, a 10x increase in problem size means a 10x increase in a run time -- not 100x.

    string length    run time (sec)
    4000                    0.01396
    40000                   0.15149
    400000                  1.28775
    4000000                13.00573
    40000000              134.23498

Try it out for yourself: generate random strings of increasing parameter length s to feed to the function below, and show how it scales

    LETTERS = ""abcdefghijklmnoprstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ""
    def word_count_time(s):
        words = s.split()
        out_dict = {}
        for word in words:
            cl_word = """".join([c.lower() for c in word if c in LETTERS])
            if cl_word in out_dict:
                out_dict[cl_word] += 1
            else:
                out_dict[cl_word] = 1
        return out_dict

I've been following this thread for a while now and have learned a ton. Thanks so much to everyone who takes the time to answer questions. I really appreciate it.

I recently graduated with a very fulfilling yet very useless bachelors in film. I've realized that film is not the place for me, and I've discovered my passion for coding and CS over the past few months. I've been spending almost every minute of my spare time practicing coding and learning as much as I can from online resources. Without a doubt, I would like to pursue a career in CS.

I was accepted into Oregon State's online post-bacc CS degree. It fits my needs very well because it is intended for people such as myself who have already completed a bachelors (thus no need to re-take GEs that don't transfer), is very affordable compared to getting a second bachelors at another institution, and can be completed in one (very intensive, 60 credit) year. I'll come out on the other end with a B.S. in CS.

My family, however, has been pressuring me to get a masters in CS. To them, the masters degree is the golden standard for getting a job. From the research I've done and from what I've seen on this thread, it seems getting a masters in CS is not always a great idea, especially if one didn't get a bachelors in CS. One might miss out on some of the foundational CS courses offered in a BS and be a worse programmer for it. A masters also might be too specialized. It seems from what I've read that, contrary to fields in the humanities, a bachelors in CS is usually the standard in this field.

I've also considered self-teaching instead of a bachelors, but I really want to make sure I have all my bases covered and ensure the longevity of my career, because I've read that some companies, although not all, only hire people who have a bachelors in CS, and the bachelors should help open doors for the career search.

One potential downside to the program I'm entering is that because it is completed in 1 intensive year (4 quarters, including summer), I do not have a summer break with which to complete an internship, and even while I'm studying, I'll be living in a smaller town that doesn't have CS internship opportunities. I've read that completing a side project independently, putting my code on github, and possibly working for open source projects is a good way to offset the disadvantage of not having completed an internship, although maybe that's not a feasible alternative in some people's eyes. I do have to say that I am a very hard worker who is used to putting in many more hours than is necessary for class into side projects, which is what I did during my bachelors. Another potential downside to my program is that it is an online program, and I’m not sure if some employers would look down on that.

So, to end a very lengthy question... Does my line of thought make sense, or am I completely off? In your opinion, would a post-bacc second bachelors or a masters be preferable for my situation? Would the online and internship-less nature of my degree be too much of a disadvantage?

I obviously want to ensure my future success by laying the foundations of my education properly. And I also want to be able to argue cogently to my family why I am making the best possible choice for my future, because, after all, they are footing the bill!

I stink at design. I'm freakin' colorblind! I don't even consider front-end development to be programming... but it's my job.

Should I just stick it out and keep applying to other places? Or should I wait until I can somehow prove myself? Not sure how to prove myself, though, if all they have me doing is static HTML/CSS pages which the other programmers hook into the CMS.

Thoughts, advice?

Some folks mentioned cheaters in computer science courses. I got to thinking. The prospect of cheating in a computer science course seems like an utterly insane thing to do. To succeed in the realm of computer science, you actually need a great deal of technical knowledge.

 So I'm curious: Do the people who cheat in computer science courses in college go on to be successful? We all know that cheaters who majored in certain *other* fields can be quite successful, but in computer science it seems impossible to me.

I feel lost and defeated, what must I do this summer to improve?",lakers222,22,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d8a5q/currently_doing_bad_in_university_i_feel_lost_and/,"Hello, I just finished my 2nd year in University. I am 95% positive that I have failed one or two courses last semester which would bring me to retake them this summer. I've been in this spot before where I was in probation for having a 1.9 GPA (in my University, it's in effect if you are in between 1.0 to 1.9 GPA). After retaking a failed course during summer, my GPA got back up to 2.2. However, I think this summer might be different. I think my GPA will be lower than 1.9 so I might have to retake 2 courses. I don't mind retaking them and I'm positive I can get A's on two courses that I've taken before.    

However I don't have any money to pay for those courses. My student loan only gives loans if I have 60% of the full course load in a semester so it won't be possible to get a loan from them. My sister currently has a job, and she is willing to pay for one course, asking her to pay for two would be incredibly selfish. My father is unemployed, and my mother has a salary of ~$20k a year so I can't ask them either. I don't even know if I would have to take 1 or 2 courses, but best case scenario is I don't fail anything or I only fail 1. Worst case is I failed more than one.    

I'll have to look for a part-time job this summer in McDonalds or something so I could pay for those courses. I've never had a job in my entire life, so it might take awhile for me to find one because of lack of experience.    

Obviously I've never had internships before as well. I have terrible GPA so I don't even know if I should try to look for one. The co-op program in my school has a requirement of 3.0 GPA, which is next to impossible at this point.    

I don't know what's going to happen to me after University even if I go through all this. I have many reasons and excuses as to why I am doing bad in school, but I know some of you guys have been through worse, so I am not even going to bother putting them up.    

Realisticly the highest GPA I can get is 2.5, and I probably won't even have any job experience. So what's left for me is to improve my skillset.    

I've coded in atleast 5 programming languages in my life and I made games using Dream Maker when I was in grade 8. But clearly I still have A LOT to learn as my GPA shows it.  

I'm asking for advice on what I should work on this summer aside from getting a part-time job at McDonalds. For one, I know I have to work on my Data Structures fundamentals. I've had a chance to work with an Arduino last semester, and I still have the Arduino materials so I probably will do another project this summer. What else must I do in order to be prepared from here on out?

*This blog post was inspired by a reader in this sub who asked me this morning for a referral to recruiters in his geographic area.*

You would need to be blind not to notice that tech recruiting firms are now tending to hire young and attractive female rookie recruiters, which is an obvious strategy (similar to the so-called “booth babes” at trade shows) to get the attention of the predominantly male tech audience.  Some of the LinkedIn recruiter profile photos border on racy, and perhaps sad.  I should confess here that I too use a LinkedIn profile photo, which is probably best described as smug.


Since I started blogging I have been regularly approached by readers living hundreds of miles away asking if I know a recruiter in their geography that might be able to help them find new work.  For every ten people that hate on recruiters, there are at least a couple that see value.  Many tech pros complain that they are only being approached by the aforementioned 22 year old crowd with an average six months of recruiting experience, sending canned messages with a pretty LinkedIn profile photo.  

*How much solid career advice can you get from a new liberal arts or PE grad who was waiting tables until a couple months ago?*  Very little, and I should know – because that was me 15 years ago (except Economics and bartender).

I deal with internal recruiters that work at my client companies, but readers want intros to people who do what I do.  These internal recruiters only represent their company, whereas agency recruiters like me can provide several job opportunities.  Instead of just replying with “Sorry, I don’t really know anyone in your area”, I thought I’d provide some thoughts on methods to find someone you will want to work with in your job search.

Actually finding a recruiter should be quite easy, but how do you know if that recruiter is any good?  Let’s start with the search for a recruiter, and then talk about some positive and negative indicators that might give some insight into their ability to help.

**How To Find Your Recruiter**

***Referrals from other technologists***

The most obvious way to find a recruiter is to ask around.  Who to ask?  Start with former (and current if you trust them) co-workers or friends in the industry.  Another source may be local user group and meetup leaders, who are regularly approached by recruiters and could know a few that are ethical and helpful.  The more veteran among technologists, and particularly independent contractors, should have a wider recruiter network than most.

***Referrals from HR/internal recruiters/hiring managers***

If you are lucky enough to have some contacts in HR or internal recruiting, they could be the most effective resource.  HR pros who have been in the business for a while will know which recruiters and firms are best and which may be cutting corners to make a buck.  Your former manager, or any hiring managers that you know, will have some historical anecdotal data on their success rates with certain firms or individuals.

***LinkedIn***

Recruiters use LinkedIn to find you, so why can’t you do the same?  Not only can you find the recruiter, but you can also discover some valuable information on their background – not to mention, PRETTY PICTURES!  Here’s how you do it:

1 – Click on Advanced at the top of the main LinkedIn screen (just to the right of the search bar) 


2 – On the upper left side of your screen you will see several fields.  Make sure you are doing a People search (and not a Jobs search).


3 – Type ‘Recruiter’ and something else that you feel is specific to you in the Keywords field.  Try ‘developer’ and the name of a technology that a recruiter might lazily use to brand you, such as a language.  Recruiters typically will fill their LinkedIn profiles with the technologies sought for their clients, not unlike job seekers who populate their tech skills section to catch the automated eye of a résumé scanning system.


4 – Enter the zip code of the area where you wish to find work and consider setting a parameter.  Some recruiters work nationally, but local knowledge goes a long way if you are seeking to work in a specific geography.  Once you start entering the code, a box appears with a dropdown menu.  Depending on where you live, you may want to select 25 or 50 miles (probably good for northeast or mid-Atlantic US), or up to 100 miles (for midwest).


5 – On the right, make sure you have 3rd + Everyone Else checked under Relationship.   This will maximize your results, particularly if your LinkedIn network is not large.


6 – Click Search


7 – Repeat, and vary the words you used in Step 3.  You should see a few different faces as you adjust the keywords.


**How to Evaluate Your Recruiter**

We’ve found some LinkedIn profiles and viewed recruiter pics (some pretty, others smug). Now what?  What methods can we use to eventually choose which recruiter(s) we want to contact?  Are there any indicators as to who might be best to use?

Just like recruiters do to find out more about you, a simple Google search or looking up the company on Glassdoor might lead to some useful info.  It also just might lead to more pictures.

As recruiters today rely heavily on LinkedIn, you can be sure that any serious technical recruiter pays close attention to their profile.  The LinkedIn profile IS the recruiter’s résumé.  Thus, we can assume that everything we need to know about a recruiter should absolutely be included there.

**Here are a few things to consider**

***Industry experience***

This will indicate quite a bit.  For one, agency recruiters with many years of experience will have witnessed most scenarios imaginable, and should be a valuable guide throughout the search.  They should also have deep networks, loyal clients, and insight into the local market.  The job market turbulence of the first dot com boom/bust and the more recent recession have served to cull the recruiting herd, so those that survived through must have been successful.

Keep in mind that recruiting is highly competitive, revenue-driven and results-based, and recruiters are primarily compensated on a commission basis.  Staying employed in the agency recruiting business is dependent upon results (getting people hired).  However, some of the successful recruiters might just be the best at selling snake oil.

***Consistency***

There are a few different items to consider when we evaluate consistency.

Has this recruiter remained in the industry throughout their career or did he/she have some unrelated experience somewhere along the line?  For someone who leaves the industry and returns, recruiting is probably a job and not a career.  Some recruiters might change areas of focus and switch from technology to finance, in which case the depth of specific industry expertise may be questionable.

Has the recruiter moved between agencies on a consistent basis?  The recruiting industry has job hoppers too, and often this can be due to lack of success with different firms.  Since recruiters compensation is commission-based they are cheap to hire, so taking a chance on a job hopper poses little risk for the recruiting agency.

Has the recruiter bounced back and forth between the agency side and internal recruiting?  This one is important, and perhaps a bit controversial.  In case you didn’t know, successful agency recruiters make a very good living.  To put it in relative terms, a top agency recruiter can make two to three times (or more) as much as the typical salaried internal company recruiter at most firms (exceptions, of course), and agency recruiters often earn significantly more than the tech pros they represent.

So why would a recruiter leave a lucrative agency job to go work as an internal recruiter for a hiring company?  Stability is one factor, as the promise of a consistent paycheck with no risk is attractive to many.  The desire to build a company and actually help create something big is another cited reason, and even though I’ve been successful on the agency side for my entire career I’ve given consideration to internal roles on occasion.

Some agency recruiters jump to the internal side because they couldn’t survive on the outside, and sought the safety of an internal recruiting job.  Some will revert back to agencies, as even the most experienced recruiters can be hired by agencies for cheap.

***Credibility***

Does this recruiter have any details that stand out above the others?  A list of LinkedIn endorsements is a bit of a joke, but you can give at least some credence to a recommendation that required effort and thought.  Are there any extracurricular activities listed that may give some evidence of expertise?

A professional blog or writings can provide insight into the recruiter’s attitudes towards industry trends.  Is the recruiter involved with any industry organizations?  Has the recruiter actually worked in the technology industry, where it is assumed the recruiter would have greater understanding?

There are a few certifications that recruiters can achieve, but their value is questionable due to the fact that most are virtually unknown even within the industry.  There is no degree in recruiting that I’m aware of, so education isn’t usually a valuable indicator.

***Conversation***

The best way to evaluate a recruiter is to talk to him/her.  Your career is important, so partially entrusting it to someone requires a level of mutual respect.  If you find a recruiter immediately tries to sell you on all open jobs he/she has regardless of fit, chances are this person isn’t very concerned with your best interests.

Find a recruiter who shows curiosity in your goals before trying to push every job on you.  Is the recruiter even paying attention to what you are saying?

*""Individuals who are successful in this field (computer scientists, programmers, software engineers, etc) are born, not made""*


Of course at the time I felt like crap for not being a consistent A/B student (even failing classes), and not grasping advanced concepts quickly enough. And his comment made me feel more like crap; As if I didn't belong in this field because I was never introduced to this material before, nor did I have very strong logical skills. 


Fast forward a few years, I obtain my degree (in CS) but part of me still feels like a failure. I totally understand the basic concepts when picking up a new language, but I struggle beyond that. I do not have any projects because I don't know what to do (creativity has diminished). I never got an internship (having one would've eased some of the worry, but I missed out).


I eagerly choose to do CS, and now I'm afraid to get a career in it. Maybe there is some truth to what my professor said. Do you agree?


**tl; dr: Professor told me computer scientists are born to do this type of work and not made. Is there any truth to this statement?**

Is it doable?,criticalhit,24,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jskzf/im_aiming_for_a_summer_2014_internship_in_seattle/,"You might have seen me before. I'm Canadian, headed to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in January. At my local CC I hope to be taking an introduction to CS class suitable for engineers (which is two semesters in one). I have taken programming courses in the past but my programming experience is very low.

I'm a few semesters out of co-op, and the pay around here is a pittance. So, I'm strongly considering going south next summer for an internship.

Starting this month, I want to do some intensive programming on my own. I hope to get some small! independent projects up on a Github within the next 5-6 months.

Which language? Well, the course will use C++, so this a short list of my considerations:

* One webdev language-Python sounds right, plus HTML/CSS.
* One ""traditional"" language-I've programmed in Java before so it's easy to pick up. I can code stand-alone projects (Tic-tac-toe?). Or, I can stick with C++ and go beyond what is in the coursework.
* One backend language-probably Django, Drupal or both.

Other considerations include JS and jQuery. I also want to try my hand at Wordpress sites. This whole thing will be in a 9-10 month period.

To ensure I don't put too much on my plate, I will try a piecemeal approach. For example, one day, I'll do some programming in C++, and the next in Python.

My goal is to get lots of projects in my portfolio by May, maybe April if that's too late, and start applying for internships. What do you think-is this doable?

I'm not above doing some brownfield development.  Almost all my career has been expanding existing applications.  But this code is... boring.  It works, it doesn't have many bugs.  But it was never made to be expanded on and it takes the opposite stance than what I'd prefer in almost every metric.  AJAX: no, postbacks.  N-tier: No, logic in the codebehind.  JSON: no, SOAP.  Unit Tests: none.  Testable: nuh-uh.  IOC: lolwut?.

**We're using Oracle Database**

I'm trying to get the schema and test data under source control and still have the build server kick off builds to test servers.  Something that is downright trivial when you're using SQL Server is really really hard in Oracle, especially when you take into account the next point:

**There's no budget for tools**

Even though they're paying me the equivalent of $70/hr, there's no budget for software.  $0.  Blame the sequester.  I spent the last week ($2800) doing something that a $99 piece of software could have done better.

**The internet is locked down**

Seems childish, but I hate it.  Roughly 20% of links don't work.  Of the rest, easily 50% are malformed due to broken JavaScript (reduced permission browser, many CDNs on blacklist)

**So am I crazy?**

**Background:**

I remember reading this chart in my first and second year of CS course and being happy about seeing progress from 2^n to n^2 and in some areas even n. But I feel that I haven't progressed much since I finished my second year of the course. I have focused on AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, and theoretical CS subjects in my third year. The focus was not on good programming practices and improving those, but getting the damn things to work as they should and as well as they could in short deadlines. I am currently doing a masters completely focused on NLP and very research heavy, so there is little programming at all. I have done internships every summer and continued working throughout the year in my second and third year of my undergraduate degree. The final internship in the third year of the course was at a research focused group at university, and focus again was not on good practices but prototyping stuff and getting it to work as well as it could.

I am currently deciding between doing a PhD or going into industry. I recently had a phone interview with a big-4 company for a software engineering position. Since it went okay I might be invited to an interview. However, upon rereading this chart after two years, my heart sank. I feel borderline incompetent, scoring lower in some areas than I used to because I forgot some things as well.

Overall, I got a split of:

* 3 level 2^n
* 15 level n^2
* 5 level n

ignoring the knowledge section as it's a bit specific for positions you are applying/interviewing for.

I am now contemplating rejecting the interview all together if I am invited to avoid embarrassing myself.

The company I'm working for has lost the ambition that lured me in at the start, and my leaden feet are struggling to keep up.  The only thing saving me is the fact that the company is in worse shape than I, and no one has the time to pay attention to my struggling performance.

I was diagnosed recently with ADHD.  Statistically speaking, I'm apparently very intelligent, but my inability to focus is crippling my ability to do any hard work.  I've been here for over a year doing Django dev, and I want something better. Here are my problems that may or may not stem from ADHD:

Even with medicine and an interesting project, I can't stay focused long enough on backend work to ship in a reasonable period of time.  I lose my original train of thought every 15 seconds, and it takes me an hour to write a stub view method, a url pattern, and an empty page.  I know the theory required for backend work.  I love crafting database schemas and that sort of thing.  I just flat out can't stay focused on it.

Front-end work gets done, though it always takes an unpredictable amount of time.  I spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to get things pixel-perfect, usually more than necessary, especially for a ship-now-fix-later startup.  It's not something I can just stop doing - I'm pretty sure it's a manifestation of hyperfocus, and someone has to physically rip me from the computer for me to stop.  Often times I get stuck looping, churning CSS trying to figure out if line-height or padding or vertical-align is the way to style this navbar.

I have a terrible project history.  I was fired swiftly from the last company I was at, thanks to my inability to stay focused on back-end work.  When doing personal projects, projects with friends, and academic projects, I quickly fall behind as I struggle to pull my weight in code.  I do fine telling other people exactly how to code and designing the overall idea, but I'm physically incapable of burning the midnight oil.  This leads to ruined friendships with my partners.  I watch them do all the heavy lifting, and my body tells me it's better to sleep or relax instead of getting in the trenches with them.  For my own work, I lose interest after the first hour of code and the prototype has been written.  I spend several days deciding on frameworks, copy-paste a block, then move on.

The last time I truly felt happy about my work was when I was doing door-to-door tech support.  But, I'm overqualified for it, and can't afford such a low paying job with my bills.

I'm only two years out of college.  Is there anything out there for me that would leverage my CS degree/fundamentals, people skills, love of video games, and/or care for high-level product design, without being dragged down by an inability to put the nose to the grindstone?  Does anyone have tips for ""just working"" even if you don't love the work 100%?

I'm a senior software engineer (10+ years, mostly Java). My passion is desktop UX, for the past 8 years I've been doing IDEs for different programming languages, can comfortably demo what I did and am really proud of those products.

Currently I have a comfy job, Silicon Valley salary - but I am becoming more and more concerned about my job security in, say, 5 years so I am trying to find what skills I should pick not to become obsolete.

So, current skills:
Java expert, C/C++ - proficient, concurrency, unix APIs, user interface design, application architecture. Basically, modern IDEs are just that - huge highly optimized codebases, usually multi-technology and highly concurrent. I love this stuff :)

I have low peoples skills (and am not entirely comfortable with English) so I don't think I'm fit to manage people. I don't like Web UIs though I am familiar with how they work. I looked into mobile but don't like the fact that most projects are short - I prefer permanent positions.

So, currently I am looking into my pet projects to see if I can grow anything into something of value. I am also considering learning Qt or/and Cocoa (I have basic understanding of both).

The first company I worked with hired a new project manager fresh out of school, when he made his introduction on himself his speech included the magical keywords that probably got him hired in the first place: agile, scrum and deliverability.

Everything was well, he said after two weeks that he could manage our department, and that he now was ready for the responsibility. And everything went downhill. Our platform was burning by being worked on several engineers over the years, because of the high employee churn rate. 

Our softwares framework had been undergoing an upgrade, and we followed through, and we shipped too early. Our production environment was burning, and the exceptions was high (so high that we were blinded about serious issues, because of all the exceptions).

On top of that, our servers badly needed an upgrade, and our hosting provider had been pushing us to upgrade for over 2 years.

I was tasked with cleaning up the platform, move the system over to the new platform, and engineer it so that we could have Varnish in front. I was asked to estimate how long that would take, and I gave a rough list on what needed to be done, and estimated it to take around a month to do. 

Our project manager refused, I could get 2 weeks. I said it couldn't be done, but maybe if we divided the task in smaller tasks, we could deliver in pieces, he refused. I later found out why he wanted me to spend two weeks, it was because projects that run longer than 2 weeks should be accepted by his superiors, so by his logic this meant: No projects longer than 2 weeks. 

We couldn't explain to him why fixing our platform was better than building new features on top of a broken fundament. We told him that these systems might break in the future, and it was only a priority to fix when shit hit the fan and our production servers was burning.

He always assigned frontend tasks to backend developers, and backend tasks to frontend developers. It became so bad that the other departments stopped with filing in bugs, because they could not stand talking with him because he could never answer their questions or understand his logic (this was a good thing if you looked at his report), and user satisfaction wasn't part of this report, so he was doing just fine!

I decided that my life was too short to argue with people that didn't understand what I was doing, and switched to a place without a project manager. 

After 1 month of being here, they now hired a project manager with the same recipe as before: Fresh out school, brought some SCRUM books with him the first day of work.

But he was an software-engineer, so hopefully he could understand our line of work better. But one of the first sentences he said was: ""I could code once, but then I got a bad programming teacher and I lost the interest"".

He is constantly sitting on our backs to get our sprint out. If we miss our sprint, everything is shit. He is constantly asking us what we are doing, how far we are with our assignments, making notes and interrupting our flow. 

From time to time a person from another department asks us about a technical issue, we look into it very quickly and they leave. Our project manager would go after them, and yell at them for interrupting the developers. I actually like talking with other departments, to learn how they use our software, and what their issues are.

Every time he is helping out in other departments and meets a question he can't answer, he takes the question up to us and asks the exact same question, we then answer, and he would go down to the person delivering our answer word-for-word. This can continue for 5 or six questions back and forth. 

People now know this, and would ask us questions directly through Skype, because through that they won't get yelled at, and here they can get an actual answer.

One time one of our developers was playing a game on his phone for something like 10 minutes, and our project manager asked him during the time: ""Are you really that far into your sprint that you can afford playing on your phone?"". The developer is working hard, and our project manager doesn't log our pauses, so it was just a show of power, but it killed the mood in the department.

I feel like he is short-circuiting our process, and I am supposed to be a mindless robot, that sits on my chair all-day coding. 

Talking with other departments is forbidden, and it is only allowed through our all-mighty projectleader. I am unhappy by not talking with our users, and having to explain everything multiple times to a person that does not understand me, and can't understand the technical consequences of his decisions.

Is technical projectmanagers really that hard to come by?

What can I do to better the process?

I’ve recently seen a spate of engineers declaring boredom and/or dissatisfaction with their current roles and responsibilities, which leads them to openly question what options are available.  Perhaps building accounting software products or maintaining the web presence of an insurance firm just isn’t inspiring you to get out of bed anymore.  This problem isn’t unique to the software industry (and based on a [2003 Joel On Software post](http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=58191), not necessarily new), but whenever a professional invests years of their life getting an education and honing their skills, it can be daunting to think that the time was somewhat wasted.

Thankfully, if you are losing your passion for typical web or software development, your training and experience have at least in part prepared you for several alternative roles that perhaps you have not considered.  It seems that frustrated developers tend to weigh their options as stay in development or leave the industry, without considering the fact that these other alternatives exist.  If the source of discontentment is tied to the role of app or web dev work (and not the overall tech industry), there are some relatively new roles that have become more in demand that may satisfy the itch you have.

This information may also be useful to new entrants into the market and grads that are wondering what they can do with their computer science degree other than just stereotypical development roles.

Here are some examples (some have crossover and similarity):

* **Performance Engineer** - This role isn’t about building a product, but rather improving speed, scalability and reliability.  Performance engineers may be thinking about databases or monitoring tools one day and hardware or operating systems the next.  It is a highly technical and specialized role with increasing market demand.

* **QA Automation Engineer** – QA is one discipline that seems to have gone through some significant changes over the course of my career (15 years).  In the late 90′s, QA meant large teams of manual testers and high demand mostly attributed to the Y2K scare ([history lesson for the young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem)).  At some point thereafter it became the norm to outsource QA overseas, making QA a lost art in the US and thus making QA talent significantly harder to find.  Over the past couple years, there seems to be some resurgence of demand for QA to be performed domestically, and hires typically will be expected to have some automation and scripting experience.

* **DevOps Engineer** – This  is another role that has been growing due to the number of shops that like to deploy frequently.  As the trend in delivery will not be changing anytime soon, the ability to automate the process will continue to be in demand.

* **Configuration, Release, or Build Manager/Engineer** – As the look of development teams has progressed from crowded shops to remote employees, combined with the popularity of cloud-based computing, the concept of configuration management is changing.  Demand for talent in these areas is relatively steady.
Embedded Systems and Firmware Engineer – Although the transition from your typical app or web developer position may be a bit more complex, one should expect growth in embedded systems to continue as the variety and sheer number of devices continues to increase.  The concepts of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things are getting one step closer to reality every day, and engineering talent with a unique set of skills will be required.

* **Project Manager, Technical Writer, Business Analyst** – Having a coding background can make the move into any of these jobs a bit easier, and your appreciation for development should maximize your shot at being successful.
Before abandoning the years you have invested in learning how to code, consider whether or not you may be happy in a different role that enables you to reuse many of the skills you have already developed.

Although you may be given some general information regarding the interview format and probably have an idea about the questions or exercises you may encounter, there are endless possibilities on the topics you may be asked about over a two or three hour session.

As was stated before, any item on your résumé is fair game, so one way to potentially avoid queries on unfamiliar topics is to keep those words off your résumé.  Regardless of what is or isn’t on your résumé, it is quite likely that you will be asked questions pertaining to subjects that are not within your areas of expertise.  Trying to fully eliminate the exposure of certain vulnerabilities is an exercise in futility, but there is one rather effective method to at least attempt to mitigate the risks.

There is an increasing trend in the technical hiring world for employers to request firm evidence of a candidate’s abilities that go beyond what a traditional résumé includes.  For programmers, this typically can be achieved through a code sample.  Front-end designers and developers may be expected to show off some UI or website that they built, and architects may be asked to share documents. Mobile developers may hear this more than any other group, and are routinely asked “Do you have any apps available?” as part of the vetting process.

One way to partially control the content and direction of your interview is to provide interviewers a work sample that will presumably become a point of discussion.  This will turn what could be a technical interrogation into a version of show and tell.  Even if the exchange about your sample only takes fifteen minutes, that is fifteen minutes of the interview where you hopefully will shine, and it is fifteen minutes less time for the interviewers to delve into other topics that are probably less familiar.

To employ this tactic, be sure to make it known at some point early in the process that you have samples of your work for review by request.  A GitHub link at the top of your résumé, a URL to download your mobile app, or a link to sites that you developed are much more graceful than large file attachments.  You can choose to extend an invitation to view these projects as early as your résumé submission, and when scheduling the interview you can express your willingness to discuss the projects in more detail and offer to bring a laptop with samples.

Independently volunteering to show representations of what you have produced will give an employer the impression that you are both willing and able to demonstrate the quality of your work.  That act makes the applicant appear more open and trustworthy than someone who hesitates when asked for some samples.  Recruiters and hiring managers alike will welcome résumé submissions that are accompanied by additional supporting evidence of a candidate’s abilities.

When you enter the interview, you can mention that you brought samples to show if the team is interested in seeing your work.  This will typically be received quite positively and could lead to a deep dive into familiar territory.

(somewhat long),ustoukconviction,21,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18xmp1/to_our_english_redditors_how_much_will_a_criminal/,"I have two felonies: a) Trafficking in a controlled substance and b) Trafficking while in possession of a firearm (rifles in the trunk/boot). I was arrested in 2004 but not convicted until 2006, so the convictions are 7 years old. I was sentenced to 30 months in prison.

I don't offer excuses, as there are none, but I would like to offer a back-story. I grew up in a physically, emotionally and verbally abusive home which I was kicked out of as a 16 year old. It wasn't an option to drop out of school, so I slept in my car and on friend's couches while I completed my high school education. 

I started dating a girl whose father turned out to be an area drug dealer. Seeing the money he was making, looking at my own circumstances, and not necessarily being of sound mind or judgement at the time, I decided that if I was to get ahead, this was the way to do it. It wasn't. I was arrested and sentenced to prison, which was the best thing that could have happened to me.

Since my release, I have completed a BSc in Business Management, graduating Summa Cum Laude, equivalent to a UK ""First"". I have been consistently employed full-time, and recently gone back to school to become a .NET/SQL Server programmer.

I'm currently in the US, thinking of moving to the UK. My wife is English, so I would try to come in on a spousal visa, if I can pass the character requirement. The convictions will be considered ""spent"" under UK law in 2016, ten years from the conviction.

Questions: Is there any chance I would *ever* be able to get a programming position in the UK? Would I have a better chance waiting until after 2016, when the convictions are spent? (I assume the employer would still find out about them through a background check.) 







TL;DR: 

Two felonies from 2006: Trafficking in a controlled substance and Possession of a firearm while trafficking. BSc Management (Honours: First). Training in .NET/SQL server. I've been consistently employed for years in a professional capacity, in a position of trust, and I have great references. Convictions will be spent in 2016. Do I have a chance of getting a programming position, before or after 2016?

I hope this subreddit has been useful for you. If you have suggestions, please always feel free to share them.

**Firstly,**

It occurred to me that, in a subreddit devoted to allowing people to *ask questions*, there is no real reason to allow ""link posts"". Most of the posts which are links recently have pointed to useless sites.

So, I have restricted posts to ""self/text"" posts. I am hoping this improves the quality of this subreddit. If the community really feels like we need the ability to post links, I will be glad to turn it back on.

If you want to post a link to a site that is relevant to a question, feel free to include that link in the text of the post.

**Secondly,**

I am curious how much ""curation"" the community desires. In general, I take a hands-off approach because I figure if people don't like a post, they will downvote it. However, there are also quite a few off-topic posts that come through and some that just...are not very good quality. Should I be active about removing such posts, or leave it up to the votes?

And how do people feel about job postings?

**Thirdly,**

I only check the spam filter every few days. If I find a post that is several days old and the author has not contacted me (via the ""message the moderators""), then it is unlikely that I will let it through the filter unless it seems like a high quality question.

In other words, *if you don't see your link, send a message to the moderator.* Otherwise, I will assume you do not care that much about getting your question answered.

**Lastly,**

I really appreciate your feedback on these matters. I only ask so I can make your life better.

Never hesitate to send me a message (preferably moderator mail, so I know it's important).

I was wondering if I could get a bit of a reality check from you, regarding the breadth and depth of the work I'm currently doing.

I graduated from college with a degree in CS a little under two years ago now. I was hired immediately by a local web development shop as a junior developer. The senior developer (i.e. the other guy who worked there and had more experience than me) left about a month later, and things started to escalate.

I'm currently managing a team of six developers. Five of them are part-time undergrads and the sixth, whom we've just hired for the company's third-ever full-time position, graduated less than a month ago. I spend a great deal of time answering questions and teaching what little I know.

I've managed to instill a fear of not using source-control, but it's an uphill battle to get my team to conform to anything at all. The phrases ""Use meaninful functions names, godammit"" and ""At least attempt to follow the coding standard"" are thought, if not said exactly, pretty often.

We have six active development projects right now, across four different clients. We have four 'finished' projects which receive maintenance requests (mainly updates to content) at regular intervals. I do the estimation and resource planning for all of them.

Four those four clients, I'm the one who does requirements gathering as well as all levels of tech-support. It feels like I'm either on the phone or answering emails for the majority of my day.

In my spare time, I maintain seven servers (and the various applications on them) for our clients. In practice this usually involves ignoring them until something catches on fire. I have root powers over things I definitely should not.

I built and maintain our tiny office network, and support our little fleet of desktops. Thankfully my coworkers can handle most of it themselves.

Oh, and I'm supposed to be a full-time, full-stack web developer, too. At some point my title got upgraded to 'Senior Software Engineer'.

I worked eighty-hour weeks for November and part of December, failing to meet an impossible deadline. It's starting to look like February/March/April might have the same theme.

Bossman says that my feelings of frustration are unfounded, and that I will either grow out of them or learn to grin and bear it. I had to convince him to let me take a week and a half off over the holidays.

Most of my time outside work is spent reading and researching server administration, security best practices, network management, team management, and, occasionally, development practices.

Relevant details:
-I'm a fourth-year molecular and cell biology student with one (or potentially two) semesters left until I graduate.

-I'm no longer interested in any of the career options related directly to my major (I worked in a biology lab for a little over a year, and can't imagine myself working in a lab for the rest of my life.)

-Over last summer I began to teach myself programming in Java, which is how I initially became interested in computer science as a career.

-By the time I graduate, I'll have taken (at least) two introductory computer science courses, discrete mathematics, statistics, and two semesters of calculus. I also have the option of graduating one semester late, in which case I could take additional CS classes and potentially complete a minor (depending on my luck in getting into classes, which can be quite difficult due to the growing demand for/lack of space in CS classes at my university).


Specific questions:
1. Would it be worth it to obtain a minor in computer science, assuming I could in fact manage to take all the necessary classes? How much of a difference would a minor make to getting into a CS masters program? 

2. Supposing I don't obtain the minor and graduate on time in the spring... Would it be worth it to pursue a second bachelor's in computer science, or should I try to apply directly to graduate programs? What is the likelihood of getting into a graduate program without a CS degree?

3. How can I go about building up experience outside of my academic work? I realize it's probably pretty unlikely that I'll be able to land an internship given my lack of experience/classes, so what would be the most productive ways of gaining experience on my own?

**LT;DR**: I'm graduating with a degree in biology, I have one or two semesters left, and I want to go into CS. I may possibly be able to obtain a minor if I stay at university for an extra semester. Any advice welcomed.

I spent the last few months applying for jobs, got several offers, and i've narrowed it down to the following two:

**Job 1**    
One of the largest tech companies in the world. I guarantee you, you've used at least one of their product today, and will many more times before the day ends. (No, it's not Google).     
Because they are so large, there's a lot of middle-layer management, and lengthy processes. It will take several years till I actually have ownership of projects. Average employee age is 30-40. Having their name on my resume would be a big deal.

**Job 2**     
A very promising start-up in Silicon Valley that makes enterprise storage solution. They've been around for about 7 years now, a large majority of Fortune 500 companies are their customers, are well respected in the industry, have some major capital investments. Very fast paced work, I will have ownership of projects very early on, very energetic work place, everyone is passionate about what they do. Average employee age is mid-20s. 

**My thoughts**    
I know I'd be much happier in Job 2 and would thrive better in the high-energy, fast-paced work environment. In a few years I'd probably have achieved a great deal, including, possibly, having led atleast one project.

Should I follow my heart and accept the second job? Or should I suck it up and stick with the first job for a few years for the sake of having their name on my resume? I realize this is an extremely subjective issue and there is no right answer, but I'd love to hear insights from others in the industry.

**Edit**

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this thread, heard me out and gave their views as well. From the very beginning, my heart was with company 2. Most of you did pick up on that from the way I spoke about them, and being able to talk it out here made me realize that as well. I just spoke to both companies and **accepted Job 2.

I accepted an offer I'm really not happy with; should I keep looking (and eventually renege), or deal with it?",the_bell_tolls,19,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12mkek/first_job_out_of_schoolhow_important_really_i/,"I'll try to be as concise as possible: 

--Soon-to-be CS grad (December).

--3.5+ GPA from a nationally recognizable (but not elite) school.

--Interned at a large, well known tech company this past summer (same company whose offer I'm currently feeling buyer's remorse on).

--Two other internships in addition to the above.

--Very strong soft skills (e.g. writing/public speaking/presenting).

--Proven skills in desirable areas (mobile and web development).

--Proven ability to think differently (through innovative projects I've created or taken on).

In short, I'm not an absolute superstar (my school/educational background doesn't do me any favors), but I'm still a strong candidate by any reasonable measure. While I enjoyed the aforementioned internship for the most part, there were several things I saw and learned about the company as a whole that I didn't really like (no major ethical concerns or anything of that sort, just cultural issues).

For a variety of reasons that I'll only bother to expound upon if asked, I ended up accepting an offer from said company before I really had a chance to go through full interview cycles with all of the other companies I was interested in.

These are some of the tangible reasons for my concern:

--I accepted a mediocre starting salary (it's actually quite poor with respect to the upper echelons of the tech industry), and I'll be working in an area with a high cost of living. Before you ask: the offer was non-negotiable (I tried, and had leverage). Money is not my primary motivator but it still chafes to see people I know with inferior qualifications taking much more lucrative offers. Given the current demand for up-to-date developers, I feel like I severely undersold myself.

--The job involves travel. This sounded exciting to me until I actually started traveling regularly for interviews. While traveling, I feel lonely and disconnected from my family/friends and the rest of my life in general. I'm an extrovert, which you might think subdues that effect (because I can and will engage people I don't know), but it actually amplifies it tremendously.

--I have a strong suspicion that my skills will be underutilized, which will prevent me from growing. I'm not expecting to be given any authority or placed on high profile engagements as an inexperienced hire, but I do at least want to be challenged and given an opportunity to show what I can do...and I'm not at all sure I will get that in this job.

If it seems like I'm whining or being unreasonable, I apologize. I'm sure plenty of people (especially soon-to-be or recent grads in other majors) would trade places with me in a heartbeat, but I'm not here by accident. I got here though an enormous amount of hard work and careful planning, and I don't want to see all of it screwed to pieces because of this. I don't expect a ""perfect"" job or an exorbitant salary; I just want to be content. And for the reasons above, among others, I already feel as though I won't be.

The question is: what do I do about this? What are my options at this point, and the potential/likely consequences of each?

I lucked out, especially considering I had only received my associates and hadn't moved on to my bachelors yet. The environment, while not great, was still extremely good. Little overtime expected, non-strict starting time any time between 7 and 9am, non-strict leaving time of 8 hours + lunch. There were a few odd things, such as a 6+ year old version control system and a complete lack of automated anything (testing and building), but it was nothing not worth both the salary and the resume experience.

I quickly got up to speed and became a productive little software engineer. Every so often I'd experience what I now call a corporate-hiccup: restricted access to a seemingly random selection of websites (along with the usual social sites), high screen-peeping potential due to poor cube arrangement and screen-peepers everywhere, and random complaints about programmers speaking every so often about non-work-related things. Again, somewhat expected and acceptable, but the benefits still far outweighed the annoyances, especially now that I'd discovered the perks of being salaried (lax hours) as well as realizing that I had a great boss and some fun coworkers. The workload wasn't that bad, and I'd yet to feel pressured in the work I was doing. I even scored a promotion due to the work I was doing.

A few months ago we moved to a new building and even though the screen-peeping potential of the cubes went down, suddenly our small group of misfits was sitting right outside the main conference room. Our group was getting a little bigger as well, the company expanding overall, and we had a new dedicated project manager reporting directly to upper management. This project manager began hiring business analysts to write out specification documents, so in theory our time could be better used developing instead of writing the specifications prior to development.

A month after our move our direct boss told our group that project and upper management wanted daily time sheets with detailed explanations of all development being done. This in and of itself was fine and understandable; having an idea of what's going on could conceivably make it easier for the powers that be to better allocate time for projects. The morale kicker from that same meeting was that some of us liked to take breaks walking around the building to clear our heads, get some fresh air, and think about what we're working on. Upper management felt this was unacceptable and we could no longer do this.

Last week our direct boss again took us all aside and told us that one of the departments our team works with will not be able to hit an extremely high priority goal and despite our team being able to hit it no problem we're taking the hit for it. He then explained how our Exec. VP has perceived our group to be leaving early due to his late-afternoon meeting where a number of us are gone after 4pm and thus not at our desks that are outside of the conference room. Even through explanations that some developers come in early and thus leave a bit early, he demanded that developers work strict 8-5 hours. We were also told that management has frowned upon a couple of us taking our (unpaid) lunch hours to get in a light workout because eating at our desks after is seen as us taking an extended lunch.

Various conversations have brought to light the fact that management feels we're not working hard enough to bring about goals they feel must be met. They want innovation and new features in their product while simultaneously weighing us down with development maintenance and customer contractual obligations. Feature lists get bottlenecked in meetings meant to prioritize development, then get bottlenecked at the specification writer BA's who don't consult the developers on the best ways a feature could be implemented. By the time we get approval to work on items the list has been had the body chopped off, deadlines are impossible, and we get the heat for not working hard enough throughout their entire process. Some developers seem to think management is trying to push my boss out, and now the best thing we can do is just work as fast and hard as possible to try and score ""big wins"" for our group.

If things get much worse, finding another job and going back to school might be in my future.

**TL;DR: Despite great pay and experience, management is seemingly incompetent and dead-set on driving morale into the ground at record-breaking speeds.**

Long story short: I'm a software engineer with two years of enterprise java experience at a large, multinational company. I took this job, because at the time I felt, that my expereince is to ""clean"", and I wanted to see how things work in the industry, I wanted more hands-on experience. So in two years I learned a lot, but also realized a few things:
* large companies with their slow processing time and creativity killing environment (""hey I have a great idea, we could..."" - ""nobody cares, it wasn't in the initial design."") is not for me.

* I didn't like the fact that most of the time the implementation was  trivial, but the domain was way too complicated (it had to do with the car industry)

* I'm attracted to some other domains (android development, UX/UI design) but I didn't really have the time to really advance with these (I read some books and did some minor hobby project, but nothing that could go in my CV)

* although I like to work with Java, something more dynamic would be more fun for me. I started to get deeper in Javascript (books, project on github) but I'm far from having a really deep experience. I'm also intrested in functional languages buta gain, no expereince.

* I find it hard to get motivated by the fact that my work will only help a huge company make even more profit, hece startups seem like a good idea

So now I'm pretty much fed up with my actual job, and I'd like to change. 

The question: how could I make this change in a way, that I don't sacrifice too much from my expereince, I find a motivating job that at least pays the bills, and I don't sacrifice all my free time (I'm up for doing reference projects, but it's hard to squeeze in more than 2 hours of productive work after 8 hours at the office)?",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,t3_1jhni8,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jhni8/need_advice_on_my_next_career_step/,

The internship will last for the summer, after which I go back to school for my last semester.


I am working on a surprisingly large codebase which was built by one developer. It is an almost-complete app, and I have been asked to complete it and also make some changes to the interface.


The problem is that the app is horribly written. I know that clean objective c is hard to write, but this app has no documentation (Absolutely none), no unit tests, and is organized bizarrely. A good example of the bizarre organization is that interface elements perform logic, and therefore changing them is non-trivial. The source code is also very very fragmented - each class has many subclasses, and most classes have only a few lines of code. The code is further complicated by the lack of ARC (a sort of pre-memory management, which automates releasing memory blocks).


When I inquired from the previous developer about the lack of comments and unit tests, he replied that header comments are 'not recommended by apple' and that they would 'slow the compile time down'. He also said that since he is not following Test Driven Development, he did not see the need to write unit tests. He also said that the system he has written will 'not work with ARC - he needs memory to stay allocated for a given period, which ARC will not allow', and also mentioned that 'some level of memory leaks is normal'.


My 'mentor' for the project, the project manager, is not a developer, so it is hard to explain to him the issues with the code. I'm trying to write well-documented and tested code, but that takes time, and he usually wants things done quickly. 


My question is this: Is this how things work in the real world? Terrible code bases with no documentation and a disdain for testing? Having followed cscareerquestions and programming for some time, I feel that at least some companies follow good practices. How on earth do I find companies like this?


Also, how do I transform this ordeal into a positive experience?

Quick background:  I am 34 and this is actually my second time changing career paths - I worked as a repair jeweler (family trade) for several years before heading back to school (prompted by the '08 recession) for a Finance degree (math was always my best subject).  I took a job in corporate accounting, realizing fairly quickly that it wasn't for me, but I kept at it because - well, I have a Finance degree and I needed to pay the bills.  After learning a little SQL on the job, I started studying other languages in my off-time and realized that I really enjoyed programming.  I cancelled classes for an MBA program and decided to take a few CS night courses just to be sure.  I loved it!  After recently moving to SoCal for my wife's career, I am now in a position to go back to school full time to pursue a masters in Computer Science - starting this summer.

I guess I am just hoping for some thoughts and general advice anyone might have for someone in my position.  Thoughts about emerging sectors, professional networking, using Github, areas of CS concentrations (mobile, database, biotech, robotics, etc.), grad school, internships...maybe things you wish you knew when starting out.  Any online communities I should know about?  What about codecademy.com, or other programming resources.  

I realize I may be starting out a bit late (at 34), but I'm still excited to get going.  Like I said, I'm at the beginning with all of this.  Any thoughts, advice, guidance, or direction would be really appreciated!  Thanks for reading!

I'm at the point in my life where the consequences of my past disregard for choosing a degree that would get me a job are becoming a reality. I graduated in 2011 with a B.Sc. (Specialization in mathematics), and almost all my elective courses were in ... [sigh] philosophy. I'm yet another sad case of what happens after abiding by the ""Do what you love and the rest will follow"" method (18-year old me should have realized that that advice only applies to those with financial support from their families). My philosophy profs thought a lot of me (apparently) and now I'm in an MA program in philosophy. I'm funded, so this isn't *completely* idiotic, but I am feeling worried about what will become of me in a year when I'm done the MA.

I am looking into the possibility of starting a career in CS (maybe database admin, or something else - not sure at this point what the options are); it's much more appealing to me than going into finance or anything else that can be built on math. I took 2 intro computing courses (programming in PERL) and I enjoyed them and felt I had a knack for it, although my focus on my math courses prevented me from putting in the regular sustained practice that's necessary for becoming good at using the language.

Anyways, my question is: What is the best plan of action for someone with my educational background to get their foot in the door for a CS career? 

There's a good university nearby that offers a second degree in CS, which I could complete in 2 years without co-op or 3 years with co-op (includes 12 months of work terms). The downside to this is that it would push me even further into debt (terrifying) since it's full-time and I would need to borrow money for tuition and living expenses (not sure how feasible it is to work while studying CS full-time; it sure wasn't a possibility when I was in math).

There's also a technical school that offers various computing programs that can be completed part-time on weekends and evenings; they range from certificate/diploma programs to bachelors. No co-op program. The upside to this would be that, if I find myself any 9-5 job to work at the same time, I could do these programs without going into more debt. But it wouldn't be worth it if it turns out that (the good) CS employers generally only hire candidates with a bachelors **in CS** from a decent university. By the end of this program I would have no actual CS experience, and I don't presently have any industry connections. Also, this tech school has very low admission requirements, and I have a good GPA from my math degree, so I worry that I'd be selling myself short going to this tech school. 

Well, if you've read this far, you're very kind, and I thank you very much. I would really appreciate any of your perspectives on what the most rational thing for me to do is.

But I don't understand how some developers can work for so long programming without burning out.

But then I'm stuck looking at a database for a week trying to migrate old data to a new database. I'm also handling some asshole customers about some ""performance"" issues at the same time I also have to install shit to a production server and it just doesn't work for whatever reason. I'm honestly exhausted with programming. I haven't been working long in the scheme of things but with Clients always pissy bugs left and right and headaches all the fucking time I just don't think I can handle this for 10 years straight.





   Thing is I'm also a photography (wedding photography) pretty sucesfull-ish but recession hit me hard. But I do enjoy coding when I actually do it and they aren't too many headaches and when I can do it on my own time ya know?  Photography is different it comes naturally and I enjoy the fuck out of it it's hard work but very rewarding because I see the clients happy, I see how greatly I'm appreciated. In coding I get none of this if everything works I get a ""but it's kinda slow"" or ""I don't like how that one little button looks the font is a bit off"" I get not one fucking compliment!

Is this normal? I thought it was safe to try and negotiate a better deal, but this is really making me question that notion.

This semester I'm taking a java programming and web design course, just the beginning steps towards a degree in computer science that I will finish in approx. two years. In a previous life I worked as a molecular biologist and as an EHR training specialist for a hospital network, but I realized that cs definitely has more job opportunities than bio-research and potentially better salary after I get some work experience.

I should probably add that I'm female and I didn't want the title of my post to come across as sexist...but I'm really curious to meet other women programmers/developers/analysts and learn what it's really like from their perspective. My java class of 30 has a total of 5 women and I'm not sure they are all majors. It's been difficult to find specific examples online and I'd like to know what I'm getting into.

I'm certainly grateful for any male advice as well, so please comment.

I know from my experience in biology that companies prefer entry level employees who have gone beyond the classroom and engaged in research or internships. Is this also the case for computer science? 

I understand that I will need to create a portfolio of programming projects that I can show to potential employers. How do I determine what languages to use and what types of projects will be of most value?

Okay, that's all for now, I'm new to Reddit and this is the fourth time I've tried to post these questions...only to get stuck on the front page reading links and articles for hours until I forgot why I was here in the first place :) Thanks!

The bright side is that what he claims about me is so outrageously false that anyone who meets me would not get anything close to the impression he gives, much less anyone who knows me. Nonetheless, I'm concerned about hiring managers dumping my resume over this regardless of qualification since I know Googling applicants is common nowadays.

I spoke to my careers office and they said it shouldn't be an issue, at least because the post is so unprofessional with respect to language in particular (there are also racist and sexist comments all over the board) that no one will take it seriously; or, I might be asked about it but it otherwise won't affect anything in a major way.

As a final note, this forum is unfortunately the top result after a Google search of my name, even before other normal content such as Facebook or LinkedIn profiles, so there is no hiding it.

I am only about 25 hours from finishing an A.S. in Computer Info Systems, then will transfer to a local university and finish a B.S. in Computer Science. This is my plan, at least.

I have been into computers since I was about 10, when I got my first computer (Commodore 16), and taught myself a little programming in BASIC. I've always been interested in computers and programming, and worked as a web developer for a few years in the late 90's. I didn't have a computer-related degree or certification and ended up leaving the field, and getting an Associates in an unrelated field.

Skip ahead to the present: I've been managing a small retail store for the past 6-7 years. I am good at my job, the store's sales and profits have grown every year since I started working there, and I make decent money, but there is no path to promotion for me there and there are other assorted factors making me want a career change.

I have made the decision to do what I probably should have done from the beginning, but now with a little more mature and focused mindset, and get a CS degree. I'd like to start a career as a programmer, my interests are in web development and mobile apps, but would be flexible in my job search.

If I continue school part time, while still working full time, it will take a few years to finish the degree. I'll probably be 40 by the time I finish. I have considered the possibility of finding another job after finishing the A.S., trying to get into the field while I finish the B.S. Either way, I will be looking to get into a field I haven't been in for a while, at an older age.

So, I guess my question is: how challenging will it be to (re)enter the field after being out of it for so long, and coming back at and older age? Will I find myself up against many obstacles, competing with younger workers, etc? Or will there be a demand for well-qualified new programmers regardless?

I plan on working on some personal projects, maybe designing a site for the store I work at, to start building a portfolio. I finished the Intro to Progamming class on Coursera, and am working on some classes on Udacity. I've been lurking on /r/cscareerquestions, /r/learnprogramming, etc, and soaking up info. I've been reading tech news, articles, learning about new tech and so forth.

Thanks for reading, any advice is appreciated!

First of all, I am still in college. I am considering just dropping out and going into software engineering full time (I have been doing this stuff since I was a kid, so I have a lot of experience + have multiple projects/jobs under my belt already).

I got a message on LinkedIn (it was an InMail) for a job up to $65,000 (software engineering) and I followed up on it and he was extremely interested in me. He said he will talk to his 'client' and sent my resume to him. The client was interested and wants to schedule an interview. I got this client's info and they work with government contracts. It's interesting work for me.

But, here where it's weird. He wanted a word document of my resume (so I sent it) and he sent it back with my address/contact information removed and his company's info on top. He said hand them this resume when you meet them. I'm thinking... why? My resume is fine itself. He also said he will handle negotiations for me.

Why is he doing this for? Should I just forget about him and talk to this 'client' directly (I have his information). I had a video chat with him (not the client) recently and it wasn't much help other than some pep talk... He asked me some personal questions like what country I'm from and how long I was here. But, I think that's sort of expected since this job requires a security clearance.

Can anyone help me out here?

Just became aware of this subreddit and would have posted here before.  The other thread helped me feel better about myself, but here's the post content - any other advice is gladly welcome, here or in the other thread!  
-------------------------------------------

I'm rather frustrated at this point in my career. I have a B.S in CIS (so not a real computer scientist - hard maths are not my strength) and ended up doing web dev for my internship and my current job (using PHP almost entirely, some Python and more than a bit of JavaScript). My current job pays crap (17 an hour in a higher than average cost of living area), no benefits, holidays or paid time off either, and to make matters worse, I'm the only developer (two html/css/design devs) - so I'm a JR Dev, but also the lead...

I like to consider myself a decent programmer, I follow the standards as I understand and know them, use OOP unless it's unnecessary, and work at writing only secure code (As best I know how - and try and constantly learn more about security). However, lately, my boss has been getting on to me about several things, a general trend of not being accurate at my time estimates (I suck at this) and bugs that pop up in my code regularly.

We have implemented a QA procedure, but often breaks down into usability and feature creep rather than finding bugs. And each feature added at the request of the boss, often adds it's own bugs, especially when a feature requires a bit of a rewrite of code.

I'm feeling pretty incompetant at this point. I've been with this job for about 2.5 years now, shouldn't I be producing bug free code? My boss sure thinks so, and it's getting frustrating on my part troubleshooting modules and plugins (Drupal and WordPress) that interfere with my code - though often I'm required to troubleshoot two plugins or modules I didn't write and ""fix"" them anyway.

Added to this stress is the whole interviewing process of which I am not good with. While working here I've been applying and interviewing elsewhere (only a few interviews in 2.5 years of being here and looking - my low experience contributes to that I'm sure), and the panel interviews really stress me out. I'm the typical introvert programmer and getting in front of people is hard enough without feeling like I should know more than I do.

Should I re-think my career path here? I love to program, but if I'm truely inept at this stuff, perhaps the rest of the web dev world is better off with me in another field...

So this (Indian?)  ""information technology solutions"" company has opened up a location here in Gainesville, Florida. They seem to be struggling to find any talent. Apparently, a recruiter has been communicating with one of the IT teachers at my local college. (Mind you, this is by no means a good technology school)    
   
They are doing a presentation on Monday for my class (Object Oriented Programming with visual c#) and for an intro class (a class about logic, and making simple c++ console programs). I'm going to attend regardless.    
   
Now here is what I find odd. The teacher is implying (and I have heard this from other sources as well) that they are looking for  new hires, and that this presentation will be a ""please come work for us!"" shtick. The teacher implies that they are looking for people like us, even with our basic knowledge, who can learn.   
      
 That is great, but I can tell you this: If our education at this school is the only indicator to our collective coding skills, then, for all they know, we all just learned to use a radio button last week. And the into class, at this point, would not have even learned to define a function. If they are looking at my school for talent, they are actively seeking inexperienced  people.   
   
So my questions are:   
1: What is MindTree doing in the US?   
2: Are they that desperate for talent, that they would hire total novices from a mediocre community college?   
3: Anyone have any personal experience with MindTree?

Ideally I would like to work for an employer that would set out a task, and a deadline and allow me to fill in the difference.  I would also like to provide significant input on the decision about what the program should do.  The most interesting projects I have worked on are the ones I have conceived myself based on a need I have seen while visiting customers.  

4. Does anyone have experience writing add-ins for engineering companies?  Is it difficult to find work as a freelancer?  How do you find customers as a freelancer?  Is it necessary to get a computer science degree to work as a freelance programmer?

Background Information

I have a bachelor of applied technology, this is a degree from a program called mechanical systems engineering that was not accredited when I graduated and therefore I cannot call myself an engineer.  The program has since been accredited and I have the opportunity to take a total of 4 tests to get my accreditation and with 5 years experience I can call myself a professional engineer.  When I was in high school I was certain this was the path for me, but my work experience tells me otherwise.  In my field I have many opportunities for employment as a design and sales automation specialist which often involves developing programs using excel based logic or custom programs with the SolidWorks API.  I am good with math, logic, thinking creatively and critically.  Unfortunately my first experience with computer programming was while I was in college and so I never considered computer science as a career.  However I believe that programming has the potential to displace all other jobs and I would like to contribute to that.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,t3_s1mx9,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s1mx9/what_do_you_wish_you_knew_before_taking_computer/,

1329788891.0,16,self.cscareerquestions,pynu5,BS v. BA in CS: How much does it matter?,caitmonster,18,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pynu5/bs_v_ba_in_cs_how_much_does_it_matter/,"Hi everyone.

I discovered this place today and I have a question! 

Some background: I'm a junior at a big state university and up until last semester, I was an English education major. I decided to pick up a certificate that would allow me to teach computer science in high school or be a tech facilitator. One of the required classes for this tack-on license was an intro to programming class. I loved it. We used php to build some simple stuff and dabbled a little with OOP and databases. I ended up with an A+ in the class and it has made me reconsider my major.

Here's the problem: Getting a BS in CSci would basically require me to start all over. My other two options were Informatics or a BA in CS. The Informatics program at my school requires you to specialize in an area (like business or CS). English is not one of those areas, so again, it'd mean starting over. My final option is the BA and I would only have to put in one extra semester to finish up. There are some differences, the BS requires one more math course, more science electives, and CS electives in a specific area (A.I., languages, systems, robotics, etc.) I'm mainly interested in databases and languages and planned on studying those things more intensively on my own.

So my real question is: With a BA in CS (and a minor in English) instead of a BS, how is it going to affect me when it comes time to find a job? I don't even know what I really want to do with CS yet, I just think I'm done with the education track. If I get an interview and mention why I changed majors with a little background information, will I be okay? 

**TL;DR:** How will having a Bachelor of Arts over a Bachelor of Science in computer science really affect me (or my marketability)?  

Leave it to a former English major to write you a term paper about her change in majors, eh?",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,t3_pynu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pynu5/bs_v_ba_in_cs_how_much_does_it_matter/,

* Unemployed, out of school a few months
* I have a BS Computer Science degree, American citizen
* I don't enjoy churning out code, though I am great at programming and can work on many levels (from the database to the user interface and everything in between)
* I don't have a specialty right now (expected for new grads)
* I enjoy the design process (such as designing how a user interacts with an application or designing how the data should be processed behind the scenes)
* I'm not the best at testing code and finding all those pesky cases, but am pretty good with a debugger
* Personally I don't think I have the endurance to work at a startup, where overtime is expected and normal
* Academia doesn't sound appealing because of all the red tape and loopholes you have to jump through for funding and research (and I like money)
* I like working with other people and working in teams.  I like bouncing ideas off other people and having them ""double check"" my logic and designs.

Those that do not keep up with industry trends and movements are at some risk of losing marketability, but even those that do closely follow tech news need to make choices on which skills to pursue (time permitting), which to ignore, and what methods to use in the pursuit.

The first instinct to learn something new would naturally be to find some good resources online and perhaps acquire a couple books.  You can find presentation slides and videos, articles and blog posts, and even attend live meetups or conferences in addition to your reading.  Over the years I have seen hundreds of engineers (accomplished and junior) that invest an extraordinary amount of time to reading about different languages and tools, many of which they may never even get to use professionally.  Some even read with the goal of some certification, which they feel will demonstrate mastery of a new skill.

I have also come to know another group of technologists who are inclined to learning in a different manner.  This group starts off with some amount of reading as well, which might be limited to the product documentation and a quick tutorial, and then immediately transition into a more hands-on approach.  Once they have a basic understanding of a language or tool, they actually try to build something.

As a recruiter, I have had candidates do a quick study on a new language (used by the potential employer) and throw together some common interview coding problem or even a simple app in a GitHub repo.  As a Java user group leader, I have had presenters build small apps to help familiarize themselves with a framework they will be describing to others, and then demo the app live.  The offer to present could be *“I think X looks pretty cool.  I’ve read about it but haven’t used it yet, but I’ll build something and present on my experience with X.  I can be ready in a month.”*

It appears that many technologists are very comfortable with the reading portion of learning, but focus there too long and never get around to creating something.  This seems to be common for some college graduates, who obtain a wealth of classroom experience but very little time spent doing.  Even if what you build is entirely useless to the world, your creation has value.  Learning by doing is not a new concept, so the educational value is obvious.  What other value is there?

**Marketability and interview advantage**
I was prompted to write this post about book learning when I was reviewing my recruiting placements for the past year.  The developers I’ve helped into new jobs over the past year have (with few exceptions) had one thing in common – a portfolio of products and code.  This was rarely the case ten or even five years go, but today it has become the norm.  The Android and iOS developers I’ve placed had at least one app available for download.  Web developers were able to demonstrate sites with accompanying code samples.  Even the programmers who focused on back end had something to show in interviews.

The biggest example of the value of ‘learning by doing’ and a portfolio is probably exemplified by the mobile app space.  It’s hard to sell yourself as a mobile developer if you don’t have any mobile app to show, and “Do you have an app?” is probably the first question mobile devs will be asked.  Software developers in most other areas are usually not subject to or judged on this direct a question.  Put simply, mobile developers know that in most cases having an available app makes you more marketable.

Programmers who work in more secure environments, such as those who build defense systems or financial software, often find it impossible to produce a work sample when seeking new employment.  Without being able to show your past work and with no personal projects, these candidates are much more liable to be subjected to a language interrogation and the game show style of interviews that many job seekers dread.  Marketability may be more tied to experience and somewhat arbitrary measurements of skill instead of demonstrable accomplishment for these candidates.

**Interview advantage**
Having a portfolio gives an interviewee a distinct advantage, in that the interviewee has at least some control over the topics that will arise.  Walk into an interview empty-handed and the possibilities for question topics are endless, and chances are you won’t have endless answers.  If a candidate brings a work sample to an interview, it will almost certainly be included in the discussion, and one would hope that the code’s author should fare better on questions regarding that sample than on questions on random topics.  Even average developers should see performance improvement in interviews when the topic is their own code.

**tl;dr**
Read enough to get going, then build something.  Don’t worry about whether your something is going to change the world.  Save what you build, and occasionally look back and improve upon it.  Bring what you build to interviews, and practice talking about your creations.

During my last year there I got on w/ an internship as an application engineer for a company, and since I had the offer to just keep working there after I graduated I took that opportunity because that the time it was a pretty good deal - made decent money for a recent college grad, and back then the job did not involve a lot of what it evolved into.

I figured I'd just keep the job and try to move more toward a development job which is more of what I was looking for at the time.  Well as time went on I got more and more responsiblities at the job, including 24/7 on-call support, performing code releases, and supporting more and more applications.

The problem was is I lost sight of the goal of becoming a developer because the company never really supported my requests to try and move over into a development role.  On top of that, everything has just... sucked at this company gradually more and more.  The people I work with are awesome, but it's the policies and the way it is ran that have just been eating away at me.

I can't tell you how many god damn nights I've stayed from the morning all the way through 2 AM or so either working on critical issues or performing code releases.  I can't tell you how many god damn weekends I've spent working when I should be out enjoying my life.

Just this week I was woken up 2 hours before I'm normally supposed to come in and work because of the 24/7 page outs, and even today on the weekend yet again I was woken up at 7:30.  I can't fucking stand it anymore.

It'd be different if I was rewarded for any of the tireless work I've put in at this company - everyone I work with says they love working with me and that I do a great job.  Yet I've been here coming up on 6 years now and I've never been given a substantial raise or promotion.  I get new projects and responsibilities put on my plate, but never a pay increase.

One thing that really fucking got to me was a few months back it was the first time I had ever not answered a page-out.  And the reason was because for some reason in my own house my fucking phone wasn't getting service, and I was about an hour to two hours late in answering the issue.  They basically cursed me out and gave me a big written warning that basically said that if it happened again I would be terminated.  So all of this time I do all this great work (I even won the company-wide quarterly award once for excellent service voted on by peers) and I never get recognized for it ever by anyone that would matter (ie people that can give me a raise or promotion) and yet the one time I fuck up they want me gone.  The only reason I probably still got to have my job was that I'm the only one with extensive knowledge in so many areas of our system.

The depression and shitty nights of sleep due to page-outs and the anxiety/stress placed on me by being on-call has made my life a living hell and I can't take it anymore.  This isn't how I ever wanted to live my life.   I'm making shit salary anyway so it's not even remotely worth it to go through this.

My question is if you guys were in my shoes would you quit without lining up another job first?  I ask this because I have had a hell of a time trying to find another job, because I'm trying to get into a job that does not have 24/7 on-call duties, yet still utilizes my skills.  I'm really fucked over because my only job experience is in being an application engineer, not a software developer or software engineer.  And all those application engineer jobs require 24/7 on-call duties, which I don't want ever again.  It's a waste of your fucking life to be on these type of things.  

I can't seem to get anyone interested in me for software development jobs though, I've had a few interviews but I always end up majorly fucking up on one part of the interview and I'm sure that's why I never get offers from those companies.  


I don't really know where to go from here.  I mean I guess I could go back to school... and get a masters?  Seems kinda pointless in this field.  Is this what I'm going to have to do though given my situation?  Or do I need to start my own side project so I have something to show people on my resume?  My problem is I obviously still know how to code, but I'm having a hard time finding interviews when I have no job experience and it's been 6 years since I was in school.

I am getting past the resume screen. Having phone interviews, I do well, but usually not perfectly and get an onsite. In the beginning I admit I had no way to measure how well I was doing in an onsite but now I am getting a good sense of how things are going after each one. 

I guess I am just a bit confused as to what is really required for a ""hire"" recommendation? For example, in a recent interview I could tell I was approaching a problem in a way that was outside what the interview asked the question expecting to hear. I implemented my algorithm fully, there were some slight implementation details that required some further discussion but it was a good algorithm and dealt with the problem in a very general way. We also had a good discussion about the algorithm and some trade off and assumptions. There were a few specific cases which were amiable to more efficient solutions however if dealt with individually. We discussed these solutions but I never got around to writing the code on the board. Would this guy really go and write a negative summary of my interview because I didn't do exactly what was expected? Isn't it better that we actually opened up some room for discussion and various approaches so that I could demonstrate some flexibility in my problem solving ability?

So my question is for those of you in the big leagues:

how well did you do in your interviews to get there?

Did you answer every question perfectly with elegant modular code and the most optimal solutions? 

Did you hack together workable solutions in a few cases and then discuss some engineer trade offs that might lead to discovering a better algorithm? 

Did you do really well in a few interviews and then just do okay in the rest?

Is the bar for the phone interview lower for than for the final hire?(I can't imagine why this would be)

How much is creativity worth? Or are you just expected to recite the solution that might be found in ""Cracking the coding interview""?

I think it would really be useful to get some truth as to the reality of the process as opposed to some kind of ""ideal"" of what it is meant to be and are what resources like ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" tend to portray. You'd get the sense reading some people talk on sites like careercup that your competition are Knuth level algorithm masters but this obviously can't possibly be true.

About three weeks ago I received a internship offer from a very small company (Company A) for the summer. I accepted it even though the pay was relatively low and travel time of around one hour (each way) was pretty high because I was getting nervous that I will not find anything at all. Right here (cscareerquestions) I also read that March is getting late for getting internships. Furthermore, no one who I met at the career fair was calling me. Right after I accepted, I started receiving calls from people who I met at the career fair. After interviewing with Company B, I've received a offer that is double in pay. Furthermore, Company B is bigger, much closer (15 minutes), and growing quickly.  

I am wondering if it's okay to decline the offer after accepting it? And if yes, then how should I contact them and what to tell them?

TL;DR: Received offer from Company B after accepting offer from Company A. Company B is closer, bigger, pay is higher and opportunity for growth is better. I am wondering if it's okay to decline the offer after accepting it? And if yes, then how should I contact them and what to tell them?

Another big potential problem for me is that my networking skills are absolutely deplorable.  However, I do love programming and am very passionate about it.

I'm a concerned student who's sort of unsure about where to go right now.

Some background:

I'm a Junior in a CS program, looking into a major emphasis for Graphics and Simulation with an eventual study in Scientific Visualization.  I've received all A's aside from my first Calculus class in Math/CS and I'm looking to possibly minor or double major in Applied Mathematics.  I've been working during break, collaborating with friends to build a calculator Android application with a virtual machine to support a scripting language for custom functions, and I've been working through a good Book and well-received online tutorial for OpenGL and Graphics Programming.  I also tutor Math/CS courses as one of my jobs (the other is working at a retail store).

My problem:

I lack experience.  My first time ever writing code was a Fundamentals of CS course, and that was just 1.5 years ago.  Right now I can only say I'm proficient enough to write code on my own in C and Java.  I'd also like to include C++, but after learning how to use Templates and Virtual Functions properly I'm finding I end up with more errors than when I first started learning the language.  The only other languages I can code a tiny amount in are XML and Python, but the former is just in dicking around with UX stuff in Android and the latter was because I was bored for a week visiting family.  I'm keeping busy enough to spend most of my days off working on stuff, but there's really only so much I can cram into my brain in under two years.

I'm concerned that two to three years from now, potential employers (assuming I don't go for a master's program straight away) will look at my resume and say, ""Wow, he only knows how to program in three languages"" and proceed to throw it in the trash.  I'm positive that until that point I'll be very strong in C and C++ (possibly Java, if I feel like being a glutton for punishment), and my knowledge of modern OpenGL and math should be strong enough to warrant some kind of attention ... but still, I feel as though I'm going to be in limbo after I get out of the school universe and thrown in the real world.

I'm also concerned that wanting to further my math education will be a wasted endeavor.  It's one of my strengths and my school offers a lot of cool classes at the undergrad level.  I'm just afraid that if I learn stuff like Topology, Differential Geometry, numerical methods to solving stuff, etc it'll just be seen as fluff to a future employer because it may not be used.  There is a set of scientific modeling courses, but it's at the master's level and inaccessible to me.

What kind of stuff can I work towards in the next couple of years to ensure this doesn't happen?  Are there any Graphics/Simulation/Modeling programmers here that could perhaps lend some insight?  General insight as to what's happening in the ""real world"" in that area?  The last thing I want is to be another one of those college grads you hear about doing nothing of consequence after getting a degree (aside from getting skinned alive).

1. Does my GPA matter? It's not very sparkling, and it's from a very mediocre institution. I've heard stories about how the final hiring committee won't think twice about rejecting candidates who even did well in their interviews just because they don't like the GPA. So this is bothering me a tad.

2. Is the hiring process location independent? Since I'm interviewing for Mountain View from outside the U.S., will it be tougher to get an offer rather than if I'm interviewing for a local Google station? Also, in case I'm considered not good enough for Mountain View, is there a chance I'd be given alternative locations?

3. Will I be asked to explain or walk through the code in my personal projects? They need a lot of clean up, so I'm just wondering about this.

4. Are the interviewers very nitpicky? Are trivial errors in whiteboard code taken seriously?

5. Can I code in the language of my choice? Will I be asked language specific questions?

I was unable to get into my schools coop program and so I am trying to find ways to make myself more appealing to companies whose internships I apply for directly.

I have a small but growing bundle of projects listed on my website at www.samcoulter.ca  and hosted on github @ www.github.com/scoult3r  which have two main purposes:

    1.Host the things I'm working on for fun
    2.Show those things off for potential employers.

However I'm worried the code im showcasing just isnt good enough.
The 2d Vector ""Library"" is laughably simple, although I am going to update that repo to a general tools Library of project agnostic home rolled code I use everyday.

My actual website is static HTML + CSS with no javascript and I'm pretty sure that my CSS classes are designed terribly. I plan on updating this to a dynamically served website with either flask or web.py or django or something. Its a low priority right now.

My centerpeice, the Collision Engine demo is also nowhere near acceptable. Right now it operates on extremely hacky collision detection and response. However I do plan on changing that, as the whole demo is probably only around 50% complete, and I am going to keep working on it through this semester (as hard on my schedule as that will be).

I know alot of ways in which my code needs to be improved, and I'm working towards that, problem is I need to be applying to jobs now, for next summer.

However, I'm currently of the belief that what I have is far far better than nothing. Is that correct?

Can anyone comment, and maybe provide some suggestions for immediate changes that would quickly push me in the right direction?

Also, what is the proper forum for saying ""This is my code, I know its shit, but im working on it."" Should that be in the comments or maybe a small breakdown on the repo README.

I'm 19, finished my first year of college at a decent university but cannot return as family problems surfaced leaving me with no money and no chance of receiving aid. (Parents are broke but make enough money that I won't get financial aid. Poor budgeting/spending). 

Now I want to get a job to save money to pursue my degree on my own. I want to be my own responsibility and have no one else to blame. My problem is that no one will even call me back. I have 1 year of enterprise help desk experience and 1.5 years of small business network administration (though it was only a router, switch, file server type deal).

Computers are my passion. It started at 12 when I couldn't play a game because my graphics card was too poor. I replaced it on my own and since then I've built my own computer, taught myself basic Python, began administering my own home server, and done many other small tasks. I haven't pursued certificates as I cannot afford them. 

I'm currently working for minimum wage at Kroger. I don't want to do it any longer than I have to. I don't have enough money to pursue certificates at this point, but would they be worthwhile? Would something like A+, Network+ or Linux+ be beneficial to me getting a job?

What can I do? Is my plan to get an entry level help desk job sound? Is expecting $17-$22 an hour to much?

I am a mobile dev intern at a local company and I plan to stay here for the rest of the year, build up solid experience at the company, apply to next summer's internship opportunities this fall and see what happens.

My college posts quite regularly, on their careers development page, full-time/part-time(entry-level) jobs and internships local companies are looking towards college students to fill. My college hands the resumes (small college, less CS students more-so) themselves to the hiring manager and almost guaranteed an interview, rather than an online blackhole process.

My question:
Would it be wrong, or dangerous to apply to those positions in order to gain interview experience? I'm currently an entering sophomore, and I don't have much experience in that realm, especially technical interviews. I would take it as a learning experience for my (possible) interviews later in the year, when it really counts.

Again, I don't have a master plan of doing this, but it popped in my head and I wanted professional opinions. I don't plan jumping internships, just simple experience.

I don't have any formal CS education. I am working in software QA doing manual black box testing. I was wondering if there is much room for growth within QA itself if I pick up more skills (programming, web dev and security, load test and automation frameworks) or whether it's kind of a dead end. 

I know there are more technical jobs in QA but I feel like I'd have to know pretty much everything listed above to move up to more serious testing, and likely still bring in a lower salary than a very average programmer (please correct me if this is wrong). Note that I like some scripting but wouldn't want to be doing only programming as a tester (such as in automation).

Is there room for growth comparable to other CS fields or would staying in QA limit me / always keep me a few steps below?

I might be interested in learning to move toward system admin or DBA if these are more viable. If there are dedicated careers in UX, that would be very appealing to me as well.

A is in middle office in credit/market risk, working primarily in ASP.NET MVC4.

B is in front office at a trading desk, working primarily with the firm's proprietary Python framework, but also some WPF on the UI.

A is arguably the more stable company, as  B pops up in the news yearly about layoffs, although I believe it's more concentrated on their retail bank side than their investment bank.

If I were to stay in finance, I'm not sure how relevant how ASP.NET MVC  would be, since it seems that for  other than some external client facing sites and intranet stuff, desktop apps reign in the sector.

As for Python, I know at least one other big bank is working on a Python based internal development framework, so I think the potential for transfer is there if it comes to that.

It's been good, but it's not exactly an ideal job or even internship. The positives are that I can basically make my own schedule (although I can only work 20-30 hours/week, even during the summer), which is good during the school year. They've basically said that they are willing to keep us on as permanent part-time. The pay is decent, better then most part time college jobs ($14.00/hour).

However, there have been a lot of crappy parts of the job as well. We've gotten hardly any training or mentorship. The company scores about a 2 on the Joel Test. I've got an awful computer that makes it hard to do any work. (A Pentium IV running Windows XP, single monitor setup. Even when I worked in tech support for a cheap company I get better hardware.) The extent of the programming involved is a few Perl scripts here and there. The majority of the job is mixed between data entry and letter composition.

When this next semester starts I'm thinking of leaving the internship and focusing mainly on school, in hopes of finishing sooner. I have enough in savings that I could live off of for about two semesters, and I plan on getting a good internship next summer. (One company in particular I think I have a pretty good chance at, since I've been working towards applying there for nearly a year!)

In order to make this work, I would still need to bring in around $200 a month. I was thinking of doing some freelance work, possible on freelancer.com. I've been browsing the jobs posted there for awhile, and there's a lot of them that I know I have the skills to do.

For those of you that have done freelance work, how hard do you think it would be to make about $200 a month? I have experience with web app development (and web design, although I prefer working on the backend), most aspects of web hosting, have a lot of scripting experience in Perl and Python, as well as some C++/Java. I'm thinking that maybe taking a handful of the smaller jobs each month would be the best, rather then the larger developments.

I'm thinking this would really help my portfolio/resume as well - moreso then staying here for another two semesters.

Deciding between QA/Developer searching, or going back for a MS in CS/SE.",NocturnalType,15,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dp3ll/trying_again_for_answers_deciding_between/,"So a while ago I made a post trying to ask whether going back for a Masters' in CS/SE was a better idea than to continue searching for jobs in CS/SE. I currently have a non-tech related job right now, but this job will only be for a couple months at most.

That being said, I'll give a quick rundown of where everything is. I'm currently in my mid-20s, and I moved down to the Silicon Valley area looking for work (though I planned on heading back to school if I couldn't find anything). I currently have a bachelors' degree in a non-CS related field (CAD, and 3D modeling mostly, though I took two quarters worth of programming) and a professional cert in CS (Java-based, covered the basics of Java plus an introduction to data structures). I also have some very very basic programming knowledge in Python and Perl, and have a bit of SQL experience.

I've been told that people with at least some modicum of programming knowledge are able to be hired as QA testers in many companies, but it seems that most companies want the experience I don't have. I've also been told that developing anything on your own time (as serious or as silly as it may be) is a big plus and will get you noticed. I'm currently working on ideas to develop at least something in Java or C++ (or possibly a mobile app in Obj-C).

Failing CS, I intended to go into IT (though I'm not sure there's much specialty for an IT program other than the for-profit colleges I see these days touting it), but that's another story for r/itcareerquestions (which doesn't exist).

If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to let me know- any and all help is appreciated! Hopefully this time I get at least one response, haha.

My question to you good people - particularly those looking for work in the UK - is this: 

**When you are looking for work, where and how do you look?**

To expand on that I could also ask what you think the best method finding a job is... how you appreciate being approached by recruiters such as myself and whether there's anything else (we) can do to make your lives more pleasant when it comes to changing roles and/or looking for work.

I've heard that half the battle is just getting an interview with Google in the first place. I want to know what tips, suggestions, and advice people have to increase my visibility.

I know it is hard to suggest things without knowing the person, but I included below a little profile of myself to help with suggestions:

Regarding education: I'm currently studying Computer Science at a public state university. I will be graduating next year. I love classes and have a 3.9 in my CS classes.

Regarding open source: I have a Github profile with 25+ repositories (not complete projects, some are just misc things and some are forks) and try to contribute something every day. I use tons of open source projects and love to support them.

Regarding previous work experience: I have quite a bit of experience have done a few internships/co-ops. This summer I'll be at interning at one of the following (Amazon, Microsoft). I didn't say which one for privacy reasons. I've also interned at a startup before so I have an idea what that is like.

Regarding passion: I have been programming since early high school and have never stopped learning. I taught myself programming as well as math like Calculus. I always try to learn about new things in the field and love talking with others about it all. I'm currently working through some classic CS texts (CLRS, Sipser, GoF, etc) and am loving it so much. I love learning from books on my own.

Regarding personality: I am very friendly, inquisitive, hard working, and compassionate. As far as I can tell, those are pretty important to Google.

So yeah, for anyone that has worked/interned at Google, what else can I do to get an interview? I applied back in February but never heard back from them.

-	Their entire security apparatus consists of a password on their (1) wireless router.
-	Short of them buying me a monitor, I’m using my own laptop, with my own copy of Adobe CS6. They are open to supplying me my own hardware and software, but that process has been slow.
-	I was tasked with making a marketing site, and when I couldn’t get it done within a couple hours, my boss panicked and started making his own on GoDaddy, which I had to completely re-do, and because GoDaddy’s web designer is a giant clusterfuck.
-	They want to make some sort of database to handle customer calls, but again, there is neither a support team nor guidance on what I would use to craft such a database.
-	I am communicating how difficult it is to make a site from scratch, within the span of a couple hours, but they need things done so fast it collapses back to shitting out a domain on GoDaddy’s WYSIWYG.
-	Its all a big mess, but I look at it as a challenge, sort of the wild west at a company that has a need for someone with a passion for technology. 
-	It’s a growing company , selling a great product, with a possible salary position at the end of my 3 month paid internship period, which is why I have a slightly positive outlook on the whole experience.

The problem is...I don't genuinely enjoy networking. I think it's dull, it's boring. Not to mention when there's not actually a problem, I'm just not doing anything.

I took it upon myself to learn some programming. I picked up a few introductory C# books, and I've blasted through them in less than 2 weeks. I seriously love it. I wake up and can't wait to come to work to practice my C# and do the quizzes and ""Try it Out!'s"" in the book, not networking. 

I get irritated if someone calls me in for a networking problem, but I love debugging my own code. 

I know there are a lot of branches off of programming, just like there are networking. Because I don't have much networking experience (brief VB.NET in college--which I aced and enjoyed), I know that I need to start practicing code in my off-time.

So, some questions:

* After I feel like I have a pretty strong grasp on C#, I want to get a firm grasp on ASP.NET as I've seen those 6 letters in almost every online position to apply to. Should I stick with C++ afterwards, or should I move into more valuable scripting such as Python, Ruby, Perl, etc?

* Is there a collaborative article on the types of different job markets for programming, as well as critiques and nuances of each? I.E. gaming, web-development, etc?

* Is there a way for me personally to be able to figure out which brance of programming I'd like to go down?

* Is it easy to switch/transition from networking to programming? I mean, I'm young, but I'm not sure if it's practical.

Oh, and you need personal projects to show that you're passionate about programming. Like college applications all over again.~~

On a bright note, I actually deeply enjoy school and developing my practical coding skills in my free time. It's just that getting an internship is such a hit-and-miss game, and I'm starting to get desperate because most companies supposedly are full for the summer. For example, I'm waiting for a reply from Bloomberg after a coding interview last week, but there's no guarantee they'll reply or that I'll even be progressing in the interview process. Maybe I could shoot out more applications to companies (I've only applied to 10 or so, after all), but that's time better spent studying and coding, or maybe I could try for Google's Summer of Code but there are no guarantees I'll get anything.

TL;DR. Is this internship rush normal? Do people really spam internship applications and get used to rejection?

Need advice.",Jimdhill,16,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17nxnv/33_lost_at_sea_need_advice/,"As the title says, I'm 33 yrs old and feel lost.  I graduated community college in 2000 with an AS.  I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

I spent 7 or so years doing IT consulting/contracting for small businesses.  During that time I honed my system admin skills installing/maintaining Windows SBS servers and networks.  I was always fascinated with databases and wanted nothing more than to build them for my clients.  The problem was I had no idea how to do it.

Right before the recession hit in 2009, one of my clients wanted to hire me on to build a database to track their inventory.  It was a risk, but I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant so I took the job @ 40k (which was better than what I was averaging).  I was researching different databases and settled on FileMaker Pro after I found that I could actually understand how to build with it.

The inventory project was a success and they wanted more.  So I proceeded to build it out to include enough modules to run the business and make it more efficient during the downsizing that occurred.  I stuck with it for 3.5 years, gained expert proficiency in FileMaker and database concepts in general.

I burned out for different reasons (commute, project fatigue, personnel changes) and I quit while I had some money saved.

I kept the company as a client and I am still contracting for them.  I also started contracting for a small business that does MS Access development.  I learned VBA and enough SQL to say I understand the languages.

In the meantime, I got married to my girlfriend and we had another child.

I juggle my time between my two gigs and parenting my kids in the afternoon/evening/night while my wife works.  I made 30k last year.

I'm really good with Filemaker Pro and MS Access but the jobs listings are almost non-existent.

I've started teaching myself C# and would really like to get an entry level programming job somewhere, with hopes that I would make enough money my wife can quit her job.

Every entry-level programming job listing I see wants a BS and a slew of other acronyms.

Questions:

1) What field do you currently work in, and what's your job?

2) What has been your most technically challenging job ever?

3) Do you ever feel insignificant when compared to other types of developers?


Here are my answers:

1) I'm a ""web applications developer"" at a company where I work on their e-commerce site, their online magazine site, and internal tools/APIs. I do back-end and front-end programming, but mostly back-end.

2) My current job ^^

3) Absolutely.

I feel insignificant compared to lots of types of developers. People who work on distributed systems, graphics/games, video/audio encoding, and a bunch of other fields that I'm not too knowledgeable about.

These questions are sparked by a documentary I watched last night, where I saw that people were able to read signals from a cat's brain and produce a noisy video of what the cat was seeing.

**(More questions)**

Who programs that kind of stuff? I literally know nothing about neuroscience, video encoding, or anything else that would be involved in creating such software. How does someone get into that kind of field? Have you ever been in a research position like that? Is the development that they do significantly more difficult than typical software engineering that you see at tech companies? Do you need a PhD to get such a position? How's the pay?

I can't help but relate this to something that Zed Shaw writes at the end of his books:

&gt; People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.

Do we really get no respect? I really love what I do, and I'm proud of what I accomplish sometimes, but at the same time, other people are doing amazing things to advance science while I'm here writing web applications to make money. It makes me feel insignificant.

I'd love your views on this stuff. Thanks!

I'm from Germany, I've got a BSc in CS from the [Technical University in Munich, Germany](http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) and I did some internships in Germany and in Brazil.
One of my greatest wishes has been to work in the States; more specifically, in CA.


I finished my studies here in Germany and applied through Microsoft University Recruiting, passed a phone interview, and then passed four technical interviews on-site. Eventually, I was offered the full-time position as an SDET in WA. 


The job is paid very well and the benefits are very nice, too. However, I was playing with the idea of working and gaining experience as an SDE at MS for a couple of years - and then, eventually, to move to CA. My recruiter said that it'd be possible to switch roles (SDET -&gt; SDE) after **a few years**.


Now I'm not sure what to do. That's the closest I have ever been to making my dream of moving to the States come true, but at the same time, it feels like there's a serious catch.


* Once I switch roles after **a few years**, my experience in the new role (SDE) would be 0 years (Please correct me if I'm wrong!); so back to square 0, while I got older.
* Thus, I'd have to be with the same company for more than just a handful of years before I can change employers, places, roles (SDET -&gt; SDE). Otherwise, I can't say that I'd have long-term experience in the field I'm applying for (SDE)


I'm sure I want to be an SDE and I'm also sure that I'd do a great job as an SDET even though it's not the job I was looking for. Also, I'm willing to work very hard and to learn a lot.

I'm just not sure whether the additional lifetime I'd have to spend only to finally have the SDE role is worth it. I mean I could try my luck somewhere else, or I could do a masters here in the meantime, etc.

I am a software developer for a small company whose primary business is not software development.  I have been a development manager previously for a large company and managed a team of 11 developers.

Now the IT shop is 11 employees consisting of 1 IT manager, 1 development manager, 4 developers, 1 hardware manager, 4 help desk / hardware technicians.
The IT shop started as 2 people doing every task thrown at them and trying to justify their jobs by improving everything with technology.
Now we have requests coming in from every direction and nothing is really prioritized as every one is working on their own thing.  The development manager is more of a lead programmer than a manager at this point.  At one point a prioritization process was put into place but our user community soon found out that by dropping the name of the president or department head, the it manager would make sure that it got worked on priority or not.  Now basically we have what I like to refer to as the toilet system: everyone dumps their request into an email and gets relief as soon as the send button is done because it is out of their hands and is now IT's problem.

I'm currently in my last year of undergrad. I have a high GPA and a couple of years of research experience, so I don't think I'll have any trouble getting into a program. The issue is, while I'd like to do research in computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, I don't want to work in academia. 

I have a friend who went on to work immediately after getting his bachelors, and he tells me that getting my Masters or PhD can hurt me in the long run, as it will limit my career options. He claims that employers don't want to hire grad students when they're ""overqualified"", and that there are far fewer jobs for grad students. He also claims that the pay difference isn't worth the extra years in school.

My thinking is that I'd rather do research, so having a graduate degree is important; employers want it, and it's the best way to learn more in-depth about the interesting topics in CS. I also don't think ""overqualified"" is going to be a problem. I claim that employers use that term when they're afraid that recent hires will immediately move on when a better opportunity comes, but if options are as limited as he claims, then that won't be an issue anyway. I also am sure that given my high GPA at a good school, relevant work experience, and motivation, I can get into a good program and will be paid for school.

What made me think about this is the comments on this /r/programming topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ve31x/so_you_dropped_out_of_college_after_gaining_some/

The way the top comments talk down on education was a little surprising to me, as if it would be better for me to drop out now and get experience than to finish college. I mean, I am working as a programmer this summer and fully plan to shoot for a good internship next summer, which it seems my school would facilitate. As for background, I was really more of a math geek in high school who decided to learn Java 2 weeks before university, and so far I love the courses and have done well in what are usually considered the ""weeder"" courses, so I'm pretty sure graduating with a good GPA is feasible, if this matters in your advice. 

After going to university for a year and developing this summer for almost a month so far, I feel like I know infinitely more than I did a year ago, and can't really imagine understanding the theoretical basis of what I'm doing as well from self-study (I'd have neither the resources nor the motivation), and I can't imagine having as many big-name companies looking for internships in one room at one time in my hometown.

I'm sorry if this post sounds somewhat gloatful, since that honestly wasn't the purpose. I just want to put down all the reasons I feel like getting this education would be useful as long as I'm not putting a ridiculous financial burden on myself. However, many members of this website would imply just the opposite, and I'm curious to see what points I'm probably ignoring here. After all, I do come from a culture that puts a lot of value on education, so my opinions are likely quite biased.

**what** **programming language should I choose?**

I'm a 26 year old guy from Croatia. Currently I am employed full-time in a job that has nothing to do with programming, other than that I am the go-to guy for issues with my co-workers PCs, figuring stuff out in programs etc. I make enough money to afford basic living expenses, but not nearly enough to start saving up for big purchases.

**What is my dream?** Being able to put my ideas (and I like to think I have a lot of them) into code and possibly hitting it big with one of them.

For the time being though, I'd be happy if I could just pick a programming language which would help me make a little money on the side so I start building my life by saving up towards the big and important purchases one inevitably will need to make (poor parents, so I will have to work hard to afford a car and such).

I'd love to be able to pick a language which can make me money on the side for now (maybe HTML and hit up local businesses, ask them if they need a website...?, anything goes though) and that the stuff I will learn from that can be used for some personal project(s) that could potentially make me some big bucks.

Since I am from Croatia, I could probably compete with cheap workers found on online sites like elance, since I don't need to be paid too much in order for the work I do to be lucrative for me (dollars are worth a lot in my country :)).

I would love to be able to make small but different (different as in having a cool new idea which hasn't been done yet) gadgety programs, games, apps, websites etc. that people would happily use, and my dream, as I stated, would be to hit it big with a software idea (a new web-service, game, app...) and then concentrate and build upon, quit my job and do that full-time. It might sound dreamy, but it really is my dream and I'm prepared to do this all my life!

I don't want to land a job, since I already have a job I'm comfortable at for the time being, but since it is a standard 40-hour a week job where I don't take work home, I have my home-time to tinker with my software ideas.

I don't want to be overwhelmed at the start, so codeacademy really seems streamlined and nice to me, should I pick a course from there? I already made an account there and I'm ready to go!

Any experience and info you could share with me will be greatly appreciated! I'd even love to talk on other platforms (skype etc.) if anyone could spare time!

The first three days of my internship leaves me puzzled. 

Formerly I was a lawyer, but I decided that I want a career switch and slightly more than a year ago, I started learning IT-related stuff (mainly coding). On Monday, I started a QA internship with the twist, that they expect me to continue working after doing a two month long internship. Just like any new employee, I am encouraged to order a PC to work on, paid by the company.

However, the wierd thing about my internship is that for the first three weeks of my internship, there are no testers in the office who could guide me. Some of them are on vacation and others are at clients' offices. And the programmers are too busy to make me feel included. The theme is, that there are no projects where they need a dedicated tester and they really don't seem to have time to bring me in projects for the sake of just letting me do something. 

I am told, that I should read about testing and the internal documents for the first three weeks. Well, before the internship started, I did read literature provided by the company and kind of got the idea, what testing is all about. Now, I just want to get my hands dirty.

So when today an administrative worker asked me, how was I doing, I told her, that I feel lonely and abandoned. She asks me what do I expect from third day at the office. I'm like... umm, if I were at home, I'd be coding hobby projects and this kind of internship is not fulfilling any of my personal goals. So we agree, that I go home and she discusses my issue with the programmers. I have not yet arrived at home, when the phone rings and I am told to show up on Friday.

Is my kind of grumpiness acceptable? Is the company's way of handling my internship acceptable? edit: ""reasonable"" seems to be a better word to use in either question.

tl;dr: Started internship with the promise of being hired by the company, found out, that for the first three weeks there is no one to guide me and nothing to do.

EDIT: Big thanks to all who responded. I enjoyed the discussion very much. On Friday, I will confidently walk into the office, see what they have me do, and just test like there was no tomorrow.

**Background:** I'm a mechanical engineer, aged 34. I've always been interested in computers, and I do a lot of hobby programming, as well as practicing it daily for my current job. I work on optimizing robots in manufacturing. I work at a nationwide company in a small country in Europe, and sadly R&amp;D is not high on our list of priorities.

Two years ago, I came across some literature on machine learning, and I've been hooked since. I read up a lot of academic papers, worked out my own implementations, played with the popular datasets available online, and tried using what I learned in my daily job.

All the projects I worked on related to the job was refused by the management, despite the obvious gains, merely since they were unorthodox (ML has no place in our standard development).

**Current:** I'm pretty disappointed with both my job and my company. I feel I could be happier working on what excites me, and I've been searching for a more suitable company in the industry, but to no avail. Which made me think of considering choosing an academic route.

**And the question:** Do you think it would be realistic for me to pursue an academic adventure? I'm old, I don't have a CS degree, I only know Python and mediocre C (I already forgot the Pascal and Fortran I learned back in college). Probably I wouldn't be accepted into any post-grad programs as I stand, but I'm willing to go back to college and get a CS degree and move from there.

I have some backup money, so I could persist a year or two with no real income. But would it be worth it, you think? As opposed to just going on fixing the occasional bug, getting paid nicely, which I truly hate by now.

On the other hand, I am older than the internet, and there are so many great young folks with access to vast facades of computing from day one. Being an average enthusiast, do I even stand a chance?

What are my chances of getting into a good graduate school?

Should I spend the extra time (if I get into grad school) doing my PhD? Or is it a waste of time?

I'm also thinking about spending an extra semester in school to dual-major in math: how useful would that be in the fields I'm interested in?

Hi, reddit. I've been a Macintosh developer since the mid 90s. My boss just asked me for a list of conferences I'd like to attend in the coming year.

I'd like to find a conference that is small, has something to do with Mac/iOS software development, and has some sessions that are geared to non-programmers who are working in the software business.

I attended WWDC in 2001, 2003, and 2007. It was a great conference and I learned so much. However, in recent years it has gotten more crazy, more difficult to get a ticket to go, SO EXPENSIVE, and I wonder if its really the best use of my time to try to attend WWDC.

I attended MacHack 2001 which was an amazing experience, but I don't think they put on MacHack anymore.

I attended a DLNA conference in 2004 in Hawaii which was a complete waste of my time.

I looked around and found Agile 2013 which seems cool, but the cost of it more than $2,000 for a non-member in the organization.

I LOVE new ideas. Especially new ideas that I've not heard about before.

I LOVE 3D printing.

I hate crowds.

I'm not that interested in going to a conference that seems too much like an ad for something. Some of the Microsoft programming events I've been to seem too much like an ad. I've been a Qt programmer for many years, and the vibe I get is that the Qt developers conference would seem a bit like an ad.

I'd also prefer to avoid a conference for an organization with a specific agenda like DLNA.

My wife and I own a software company on the side and have had some success writing iOS apps. She's never attended a professional conference like this and we would like to go to one that isn't too expensive for us to buy a ticket and for her to get something out of it.

I live in Austin, Texas. We aren't rich, so I'd like the conference to be some place not too far or difficult to travel to. Also, my wife is pregnant so I don't want to put much stress on her.

We could not afford to attend SxSW Interactive because it is too big and too crazy and the tickets are $900. However, we did attend SxSW Create which was free and mostly about 3D printing and arduino and stuff like that.

===================================================

Hi guys,

So I've been teaching myself programming for a few years now (on and off); I kept jumping from language to language, never really getting past doing the basics in the language before moving on to the next one.

Finally I started using C# and stuck with it as I really enjoyed working with it and Visual Studio. Now I've learned and put into practice various technologies such as: WPF (using MVVM) pattern, Entity Framework, LINQ, Asp.NET MVC3, basic unit testing and basic DI; I'm also handy enough with SQL as I use it to some degree in my current job and through various web projects. I've got four small projects that I'm working on now, with two of them (mostly complete) up on Github.

I've gotten to the point that I feel like looking for a job, that I could be a suitable entry-level candidate; I've sent quite a few applications, but the only thing I hear back is from recruiters trying to slot me into some form of support role (the best I've been offered from a recruiter is Application Support/Development, 50/50 split in the work, apparently; which would at least be a foot in the door).

I'm getting dispirited with the lack of any answers and I'm just wondering if there is any advice you guys can give me? Whatever the advice, I appreciate it.

This means that I'm rarely able to put in real effort on the projects I'm expected to complete.

Given that information, my questions are:

* Has anyone else had this problem transitioning from a mid to senior position?
* Is this level of responsibility normal for a senior position?
* Is there any advice, articles, etc. out there that help with this sort of transition?

1) I'm in my first semester of my sophomore year with a 3.7 major GPA (will be around a 3.88 or so after this semester) and a 2.92 cumulative GPA (soon to be a 3.1-3.2, but regardless I've never had lower than a C in any class and lower than an A- in a programming class) at a good university. I have taken 2 algorithms classes that are done in C++ and I'm currently taking a UI class (in Java), a Computer Organization class (which doesn't involve much programming, but it does use some C and assembly) and another Data Structures and Algorithms class (again in C++). I started off with Java about 5 years ago and continue to use it for side projects (I have 3 Android apps on the market and create games and videos with/over LibGDX). I would love to get an internship this summer but most places require that you have your sophomore year finished and have a 3.0 (which I will have by the end of this semester), when I'll only be halfway through. Would I have any chances at landing an internship based on my history of past projects and taking a few CS classes early and high major GPA (even though my cumulative is less than stellar? Also, being in Ohio, what could an intern be expected to have thrown their way in terms of compensation?

2) I currently work as a TA for my university's intro programming lab. Someone in the lab asked me to tutor them on the side and offered to pay. A) How do I charge? By the hour? By the session? B) How much do I charge? I know if I was a tutor through my school I'd be getting paid at least $9/hr (pay is dependent on the total and level of classes you can tutor for).

3) Now that I've been doing C++ for a short while (and Java for 5 years), I still don't feel very confident. I can do all of the basic tests that people have posted regarding job interviews (FizzBuzz, check if a string starts with an uppercase, check if a string is a palindrome, etc.) but I feel that's over-simplistic and once I passed that I'd be overwhelmed once I started working.

Unfortunately, I can no longer pay to take classes at my university. My funds are exhausted and I'm busting my ass at a fast food restaurant to pay bills and get by. 

My question is this: with limited experience in both programming and networking/sys admin, what should I do from here?

And assuming I'm successfully able to teach myself how to do something, how do I get myself noticed when I apply for a job? With no degree to speak of, most employers will understandably not look too much at my application. 

Should I go with programming (Java, C, C++, etc.?) or networking/sys admin? Where should I start? I know basic concepts in each field, but little else. There are certifications in networking and sys admin that I could get. Is there anything similar for programming?

* No internship experience
* Not as high of a GPA

And I learned that academia blows hard. Or at least, I learned the value of assessing people's motivations. Professors want shitty publications, non-programmers just want software that works and makes sense, PhD students want to graduate, and immigrant students get into programming out of fear of not landing a job (i.e. they don't actually like this shit).

Point is, I learned that academia is great if you find *competent* people who work on challenging problems. But it sucks otherwise.

So being a college kid with nothing to do until school starts, I’ve been thinking about what I actually want to do with my programming skills. Having only seen the academic side of the fence, here are the career paths that I imagine most programmers go down:

* Work for the man. Work for (Microsoft|Google|Amazon|Facebook|Yahoo).
* Work on startups that mostly fail.
* Write Java and .NET business apps to pay the bills, and work on what you love in your free time.
* Do sysadmin work.
* Be a SDET and write test cases. Or do QA work.
* Be a “project manager” who doesn’t write code, and who can’t program his way out of a paper bag.
* Make indie games and be a starving artist. Write code, make art, make music, be a jack-of-all-trades.
* Work full-time on open source software.
* Work on computer security, or whatever the folks at /r/netsec do.
* Be John Carmack or Linus Torvalds.
* Do embedded systems development.

I honestly have no idea what I'll do when I graduate, and that scares me. So I’d like to know, because I want to get a sense of what it's like to program for a living.

**TL;DR - After 12 hours of interviews a company wants one more.  To find out where I stand and if they are serious I'm thinking of asking them to pay me $100 cash to come back in.**

The details:

Applying for IT/programmer job with 5 years experience.  Here's what I've done over the past few weeks:

-2-3 hours of assorted phone interviews

-3 1-hour online tests.  Some of it skills based, some of it personality

-8 hours on site interview where I did a 3 hour technical test and one on one interviews with 4 other people

It sounded good initially, but after the on site interview it is not my dream job.  For the right amount of money it could be tempting.

Here's where I need advice:  As I was leaving the day long interview the recruiter mentioned that one of the people who was supposed to interview me was sick and that they might ask me to come back in for one last interview.  It's an hour drive each way to their office (I would be moving if I accepted the job) and I'm currently working so I have to take PTO to go there.  I'm beginning to feel like they are using too much of my time.  I can't imagine what more information they would need after all the input they've received and frankly I don't know where I stand in their process.  They are only hiring one person so they could be using my time when I'm only a contingency for a preferred candidate.

Here's the idea I'm floating:  If they ask me to come in for another interview I will agree on the condition that they pay me $100 cash for showing up.

My reasoning is if they are serious about paying me ~$100k then $100 is inconsequential.  However if $100 is too big of a risk for them then I save myself the cost and inconvenience of showing up.  If they are serious and pay me and it doesn't end up working out then I'm at least compensated a token amount for the 12 hours of time invested.

How likely is this idea to ruin a good job opportunity?

If you include region and experience level, that would be helpful as well.   

I am asking because I am quite burned out. I have a ""prestigious"" job at an investment bank, but 60 hours a week is something of a baseline here. We can't get any work done during the day, because our phones are ringing, or various emails are coming in that need to be responded to, so dev work tends to start later in the day. I find it very difficult to switch gears in an environment like this. I am trying to figure out if the fun is gone from software development, particularly in finance, and if I need to switch industries or maybe even careers, and if so, how much of a hit to my paycheck I will take. 

The worst part is that my coworkers are all a few years younger and seem to be robots. They don't get excited about the weekend. They seem to care less about holidays (on a Friday before a 3 day weekend, we still have a full house at 7pm). I am not sure if they are trying not to show weakness, but they just don't seem human. There is virtually no office chit-chat at all. I used to get quite annoyed at the office gossips in past companies, but the lack of ""hey how was the weekend?"" on monday mornings (or any of that sort of talk any day of the week) has left me feeling quite lonely and isolated. My direct boss seems to encourage this, while my group's boss is very different and is extremely social (he was actually the guy that hired me, but was promoted a few months later). 

This seems extremely abnormal to me, but my last job seemed to be heading this way. More hours, days becoming more brutal, and general conditions that are just less humane. Everyone is scared to get laid off. I used to be considered ""passionate"" about my work, but compared to these guys, I am a slacker. At 6, I want to go home and see my new wife, and my dog, not slave away to hit some deadline that really doesn't matter. 

I need some data so I can figure out what I am doing with my life...  I guess I should answer first: With about 10 years experience, I have a 150k base, last year's bonus was 20k, but pre-crisis was generally 40% of my base. This is in NYC, coding in C++. I would say I used to be a star, but lately I have felt isolated, burnt out and demotivated. My care has just been sapped away.

I am a CS senior undergrad who simply looks awful on paper.  Due to debilitating procrastination, I am about to be kicked out of school for terrible grades even though I am almost finished my program.   I have no work experience and can't say that I'm one of those genius programmers who for whatever reason, did not go the normal degree route.  

Although my soft skills (reading comprehension, formal writing, presentation, creativity, analytical thinking, interpersonal communication etc.) skills are excellent, my technical skills are average at best for a typical CS undergrad.  From what I've read on employer blogs, I fall into the group that they most complain about; [CS undergrads who are practically useless](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/02/the-nonprogramming-programmer.html).

The only thing I think I have in my favor for employers is that I'm able and **willing to work for free for up to a year** due to an emergency cash fund that I've saved.  Sad as it is, I'm primarily looking for the dignity of white-collar work, the chance to be employed/advance in the field which I was trained for, and the ability to show my friends and family that I'm not a total life fuckup.

I'm pretty near rock bottom mentally right now and am planning to shelve my life in order to whatever it takes to develop my skills/value to the point at which I can become employable.  At this point I'm not sure I have any options other than trying to display above-average results on a technical exam/interview and indicate to the employer that I'm willing to work for free.

What are the most beneficial steps I can take to convince an employer that I'm employable?  Should I focus my time and effort on solidifying my knowledge on data structures and algorithms?  Or should I be mostly working on code-katas all day to become comfortable with typical programming languages?  What should I write on my resume given my shitty situation?

- I am currently enrolled in three Udacity courses: 1) CS212 Design of Computer Programs, 2) CS253 Web Applications Engineering, and 3) Programming Languages


Question:

- Aside from the additional knowledge gained from taking these courses, how valuable are they when looking for jobs? Do employers care if potential employees have taken these courses?

- Should I put them on my resume? If so, how/where would I do so?

- If you have any stories to tell about coworkers or employees that you've hired that may relate to this, please share! If you've taken these courses and found better success finding jobs because of doing so, even better!


Note:

- If you are unfamiliar with these courses, they don't count for credit, and they're very informal (they don't require identity verification, they can't really prevent you from cheating, etc.).

Just to give some history, I have a Bachelors in CS which I followed up immediately with a Masters in Computer Engineering. School was a great learning experience and some of my favorite classes were Concurrent Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems and Computer Networks. 

When I graduated, I started looking for a job with some of the biggest software companies around. However,  the times were rotten and the economy was FUBAR. After months of unemployment and failing to get a job offer from the dozens of interviews that I attended, I was finally offered a role with one of the biggest software companies out there. The catch was that it was a QA and not a dev job but I was desperate for anything and I had student loans to pay off. In retrospect, that might have been the worst decision I've made in my life. 

It was exciting initially - I had my first real job and the pay (to me) seemed fantastic. Flexible hours, stock options and a great boss, I had it all. However, then the excitement wore off and I started hating my job. The only times that I felt good about my work was when I was developing test automation but that was a really small part of my job. For the most part, I was running tests manually and filing bugs. I also realized that QA people are looked down upon by most developers in the industry. I started feeling that I wasn't utilizing anything that I learned in school and that I had wasted all those years of education. I also found out that I was woefully underpaid in comparison to the industry average. So I started looking for a new job.

So after one and a half years of working for my first employer, I started working for a second employer with a significant pay increase ALSO in a QA role. I told myself that the increased pay would make me like QA and make up for the downsides. Boy, was I wrong! I've been with this company for three years and I hate this job as much as the last. I've realized that the only way I'm going to be happy is if I find a full-time development role. I'm interested in system programming, writing device drivers and operating system kernels. However, with the kind of experience that I have on my resume, the only kind of job offers that I get are QA related.

What advice does reddit have for me? Here is what I've thought of:

1) Writing open source code: I've actually been trying to contribute for a long time but its so freaking hard to get started. How do I find a project I like? How do I contribute to that project?
2) Working on side projects outside of work: Again, with my relative lack of experience and because of my full time job, its hard for me to just write a project on my own
3) Apply for programming internships. Is this even an option given that I'm not a fresh college graduate any more?

TL;DR I am a QA engineer who hates this line of work after working two years in this industry. I'm desperately looking to move on to full time development roles but I'm getting typecasted into QA positions because of my prior work experience.

The problem is, I'm unsure whether I should go back to school for 3 years and get a BS in Comp Sci or if I should start learning on my own and looking for a entry-level position. I have no coding background and I have just started learning how to code. I also have a limited networking background but would be very willing to learn that as well. (Network administrator and computer programmer were two of my top occupations). My question is, should I bother going back to school and getting another degree or should I try to succeed in the market without one? If the latter, what would you recommend in starting out? What are some good books, the best languages to learn, good website references, and entry-level jobs I should try to find? I much appreciate any help as I am 23 and I feel as though I wasted a good portion of my life on jobs that don't matter and a degree that has barely earned me anything practical.

The other day I applied to a 'Web Developer Intern' position and got a call back today asking to schedule an interview later this week. It's a part-time internship (~20/hr per week) that will last approximately 3 months.

Here is the description for the internship:
""We are currently looking for individuals to fill Academic / Unpaid Internships, whose interests are in the following areas: Web programming/ developing using HTML, CSS, C++, and all multi-media platform programming. You should demonstrate the ability to create the look and feel of a web page, with a clear-cut understanding of how the web page works. The individuals will have exposure to being part of an initial creative meeting; communicate what will work for layouts, organization of site, types of media, and other overall graphic design. The individual should be a self-starter, creative, and willing to be part of a creative branding team. This is not a gopher position. This internship is a learning opportunity to be a part of a collaborative marketing team. The intern will be educated in the development of social media campaigns, marketing, and project management. Additionally, the intern will have the opportunity to become familiar with emarketing development and strategies and analytics. The intern will be supervised by the Director of Marketing / Social Media Development. The candidate will accumulate myriad branding and marketing experience. As a reminder, this is an Academic Internship position and is therefore, unpaid.""

I have come across many threads and opinions on unpaid internships, but I was wondering if this sounded like a position that's ignorant to the [FLSA](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm) or if because I ""may"" get credits when I apply my internship to my college, that it is justified.

Also, if you believe I should be compensated, then what should my actions be in the interview I have? Should I bring it up? Call them out on it?

Great salary, bonuses, benefits, etc. Started as a recent college grad then got this unexpected job. The only problem now is that, I don't feel like I'm growing at all. I feel like I'm stagnant and if I stay any longer, I risk staying at this job for the rest of my life. I don't see much innovation in my department except one thing, mobile app, and that work is going to the senior devs while I'm stuck with what they don't want to do and most of the work goes to India. They say I can help them work on it, but I can't because of the stuff I'm responsible for. It keeps building up.

My ex-coworker who was a contractor and left early highly recommended me to leave while I'm still young and have a chance before it's too late (starting a family and etc). He says I'm risking my career by staying here any longer and I'm seeing why. He has experience so I do take his opinions to an extent. I still have a car loan, but even after paying that off, I'll still have enough money to survive at least 6 months while living with my parents (that's how I saved up money in the first place). I'll just have to go back to college mentality and not spend on my wants and only on my needs.

I'm going to travel a bit soon which was planned couple months ago and after I come back, I want to pursue couple of mobile app ideas I have on Android full time (along with other programming languages which I am curious about). Then if I don't see a future in the mobile app ideas I have in 4-5 months or sooner, I'll start searching for jobs while still working on the personal projects and hopefully the job can help me grow at the same time with new projects. Even though I have paid vacation, I'd rather quit before I travel than after I come back. What do you think?

**Edit**: Another thing that bothers me about this job is that work never really stays at work. If there's issues only I can figure out, then I'm called. Doesn't matter if I'm on vacation or not.

I took one Programming course as a Freshman and I really enjoyed it. Then I dropped out and switched to accounting for a few reasons. Mainly, I worried that I'd be disadvantaged in a programming career since I'd be competing against people who program as a hobby, outside of class assignments or work, and thus would be much more knowledgeable in the field. (This is not a problem in accounting, lol). I enjoy programming, but not enough that I'd learn a new language just for fun. I also heard awfully negative stories about outsourcing being a severe problem in this field.

If you could answer the following questions, it'd really help me reach a decision regarding whether or not I should switch back to CS:

1. Are you a CS major, an employed programmer, or other?

2. Did you begin programming before enrolling in college, or was CSC 1XX your first exposure to programming?

3. Would you continue to program for fun or as a hobby, even if you knew you could never obtain payment for doing so?

4. Am I at a severe disadvantage since I was first exposed to CS in college and do not program for fun, or is this common in the field?

5. I've been told that in a programming career you are expected to constantly learn new material (e.g. different programming languages). Would you say the need for continuing education is much greater in the field of computer science than it is for other professional fields such as medicine, accounting, etc.

6. I heard frightening stories about how all programming jobs are being outsourced to India, decreasing the pay and benefits of American programmers. To what extent is outsourcing a problem for the programming field. Is it moreso a problem for programming than it is for fields such as accounting, engineering, etc.?

7. What is your annual salary?

Scared to death by raising the issue with the boss.

Hello. I am looking for some advice around what I regard as a particularly tricky job situation. I am an SDE with Amazon in a not-first-world location and am looking to transfer to Western Europe or, if that's not possible, to Seattle hq. I have been with the company for around 2.5 years and I have the requirements to transfer around. I have also seen other people around me moving to US, but haven't had the guts to ask them how they did it, for fear of having it known that I shop around.

This being said, I'm slightly paranoid and afraid about screwing up the whole thing, and would welcome any comments from anyone who has experienced a similar situation. Some questions I have:

- Did you talk to your boss first or did you first secure a position with the other team? My boss has been pretty supportive of me while on my current team, but I'm afraid he'll rip me apart if I'm trying to move out. And since I'm transferring remotely, it would be hard to have the other team fighting for me. I do a good job, but by no means a rockstar.

- Best way to get in touch with other teams? Emailing their manager and taking it from there would do? I have aimed a couple of teams from both Retail and AWS and could do a good job learning about them and being able to handle myself in a discussion with the hiring manager. Just want to make sure he won't go straight to my boss after talking to me.

- How to reply to the question: ""Why do you want to move?"" I assume extra salary, better life, anything personal-related would not do. I have never lived, nor do I know anyone in the places where I want to go. My own team does have people in seattle I could go to, but how can I go to my manager, ask for a transfer (which would involve the company giving me way more money) for me to do the exact same work, only over there? I have thought about ""Better opportunities to grow while at company hq in seattle"" but I'm still a (relatively) young engineer and could still grow right here for a few more years. Can't really complain of my team here, my workload, visibility, etc. It's a pretty great team, and if it were in seattle or london I could see myself remaining here for another 3-4 years, I have room to grow. 

- Speaking of money, how do salary negotiations go in internal transfers? Do you get made an offer and it's take-it-or-leave-it? Is it at local levels or at Amazon (better than local average) levels? Glassdoor has pretty good info on US salaries, but not too good on european ones.

- Visas won't be a problem, I won't dig into the precious H1B pool if I go to the US as I qualify for an L. I will also require no additional papers to work in Europe. So at least that's a good thing.


I know there are amazonians in cscareerquestions and I assume other big companies have similar transfer reqs. Would welcome any advice I can get. I really like the company and would like to keep working here, but not at the price of remaining stuck in this third world shithole where I am, not when so many companies worse than mine want me in better locations. Most paranoid I am of my current team getting in my way (I do a reasonably good job and we are desperate for more people) and of my move costing the company more money even though my work would stay the same (or would grow regardless of location). I also have no good justification (other than wanting to try a new location and new lifestyle for a few years, before I'm too old and have kids).

Can you please help advise a young, naive, gutless and paranoid guy looking for a way out?

Should I link forked Github repo or the upstream repo on my resume?

# **Should I delete forked Github repo that I no longer contribute to?**

But there are certain projects that I had submitted few patches and then stopped contributing. Those forked repositories are still present but I do not pull changes from upstream to them.

Should I keep them lying there? 

I think it is better to remove because I do not even merge upstream to them anymore. A dead repo might leave a bad impression on the prospective employer. Secondly I hate seeing fluff when I go through my Github repositories. There is no way to ""archive"" a Github repo.

But then, keeping them there will let the visitor know that this guy takes interest in these projects. If I delete them, there is no obvious way for them to figure out the projects I have contributed to. Unless I get the chance to speak to them and this topic is brought up.

What should I do in this case?

# **How do I make my contributions obvious?**

The specific patches or the ""big"" feature you implemented are not obvious whether you visit the upstream or forked repo, unless recruiter bothers to look under the hood. Should I edit the description of forked Github project and make my contributions clear on it?

My understanding is that getting called for the interview is a big thing. I want to optimize my image to help recruiters eye fall on me. One look and he think ""Hmm, this guy is worth contacting for an interview"". Hence these questions.

From what I can tell I'd probably be looking at about another 35-40% pay increase for making the jump. 

I've already notified them that should I get an offer, my start date is going to have to be postponed a few weeks while I wrap up a few of my responsibilities for a coming release. However, some of my dependencies have been delayed significantly (we're talking months) and I'm extremely worried about getting to a breaking point in time. I'm  the lead developer on a few efforts and it's going to inconvenience my team significantly if I leave them unfinished work because I'm the only person with the system-level understanding necessary to do it in time for the current deadline. 

Compounding this is that my company has a reputation for rushing you out the door once they know you've accepted another offer, particularly if it's for competitor. If I give 6 weeks notice, They may very well say ""no you get 2, excluding your vacation time"". So I'd have to withhold the information that I'm leaving until the actual 2 week mark.

I'm debating between locations, salary, and my potential future.  Anyway, here's a summary of what I'm debating over (Four offers, but only three locations):

Chicago:  Mainly C#, small company that I really liked, and I think I would really enjoy both Chicago and the Company.  However, the salary is lower and I'm unsure how a lesser known company will look vs. a bigger, well known company in terms of the future.  Ability to potentially wear more hats, but I don't see as much potential to advance within the company.  One last thing:  more vacation than anyone else (except Madison, if I got that).

Minneapolis:  PHP, C#, C, other random things possibly.  Big Company, but more formal environment.  Liked the people, Minneapolis is still cool, also about ******* after sign-on bonuses + profit sharing for the first year.  Minneapolis and the company doesn't seem as exciting to me, but I still enjoyed meeting them a lot.

Rochester, MN:  PHP, possibly others.  ~$****, low cost of living, high bonuses...essentially, the best overall offer money wise.  I really liked the people and company, but Rochester, MN just isn't a very exciting place (feel free to change my mind!).  Lots of potential here to move to other things like embedded systems development (I have a computer engineering degree plus a CS degree).

One of the locations has two similar offers, so for staying a bit ambiguous, I won't say which.

There are also two offers I may get in this coming week (I have to make a decision by the end of this week):
~~Madison, WI -- a position that is about 70% management, rest Development.  I really like the idea of being able to do both of these things instead of just development, and may put me on a interesting career path starting out.  My chances of getting this seem high right now.  I also really like Madison.~~

San Fransisco, CA -- Web Development, high cost of living, seems like a really cool company.  Unsure if they'll be able to extend an offer before the deadline, but they are aware of it.

So, ultimately, I'm curious on people's thoughts on the following:
* Small company (little salary) vs. big company (bigger salary) vs. Management Position in Madison (likely less salary, amazing benefits and vacation, plus an interesting starting career path)
* Location
* Future Career (Advancement, how things will look on my resume, etc.).

I'll likely censor out some of the salaries in this post later on.  Anyway, thanks for any advice and sorry for the long block of text.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,1364795774.0,,,True,t3_1ahhl9,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ahhl9/four_offers_three_locations_big_company_higher/,

I have worked on large projects for class, but I haven't really done any projects on my own outside of class. How much will this impact me?

Also, I'm pretty apprehensive about technical interviews in general. I do well in school, but a large part of that is because of my study habits and whatnot.

I've enjoyed most of my other classes, but these were the ones that I was really passionate about. I may be wrong, but it seems like it would be more difficult to find a job in those fields.

I currently work as a programmer on a permanent basis, looking to build up my skills as I've only been in the industry for a couple of years... was just thinking of the next steps in programming and have a few questions..

What downsides are there to becoming a contractor?

Isit it feasible to travel to one country, pick up a contract for say 6 months and then goto another country and do the same?

Are companies generally open to the idea of myself living in one country and just work remotely as a permanent programmer?

As a more senior developer, do I hone my skills and become a ""specialist"" in my field or become more broad and learn the latest techs?

I read over a lot of the ones on the first couple pages, so hopefully my questions won't be redundant.  

I just recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I have been in school full time.  I have done some on the side stuff including: accounting/bookkeeping, tutoring, and retail work, but have focused mostly on school for the last few years.  I have the basic computer experience most computer savvy CS grads would be expected to have.  I don't have any on paper programming/CS type experience.  I didn't take advantage of internships while in school.  I have the academics and the theory, but not so much real world experience.  Hopefully this will all fall into place quickly.  I know that many jobs look for recent CS grads with a theoretical background who need to be ""baby-stepped"" into the industry; but I know not every job is like that.  That is not to say I don't have other talents.  I have experience in: academic programming, IT, bookkeeping/accounting, education, project management, event organization/coordination, writing (promotional, advertising, etc.), photoshop, and digital audio engineering/mixing.

* I have applied for a few jobs, and potential employers/recruiters have asked me what my expected salary is.  I don't want to low ball myself here.  I did put in the work for a B.S., however I am aware that as a new grad with little experience I can't ask for a top end salary.  What range would be fair (in southern and northern California) for myself AND the company?

* Any specific tips in how to land beginning CS/programming type jobs that will give me a good start?

I'm not talking about things like the middle name of the person who sits next to you in data structures 101, obviously!

I want to have an honest discussion about this topic because I see a lot of attitude on this subreddit that suggests college inherently means you know more.  This can only be true if college has a monopoly on information.

Please, let's not flame each other.  I could argue both sides.  For instance, we're in this subreddit to get jobs.  How much you want to bet CS majors have more CS jobs than people who never graduated?  Let's have an honest discussion and please if you have interesting data, do share!

It's healthy for all of these high-school kids looking for direction to make realistic approaches to their future.  What kind of odds do they have of graduating with a CS degree?  What are the odds for a typical person who doesn't attend college to get a CS job?

Now to bring it to a full circle.  I think it's possible to do anything without college.  Especially computer science.  What say you CSCareerQuestions?


**EDIT**

One Particularly good response is networking.  I would answer this by saying voluntary local meetups are more valuable because you'll meet only people who love CS and not people who are there because they heard they could make money.  On top of that there is open source projects to actually work with others and learn good coding habits.

Another good point is pertaining to career fairs, but these aren't exclusive to colleges as the same companies at the career fairs typically hold the same fairs off campus.  Showing up off campus says you're attacking the job market.  On campus you could be attacking or you could be there for the free stickers and donuts because your next class isn't for another 15 minutes.

**EDIT2**

Some data I find interesting and mentioned in the comments is opportunity cost.  You're easily spending 100k to go to college.  That's probably a low estimate too.

Average graduating student loan debt is 27k.
Min wage for 4 years @ 40 hour work week is ~48k
total using minimum wage = 70k opportunity cost

now factor in most people take more than 4 years and most people pursuing CS will be making probably closer to 20k/yr within a year.

1 year at 12k four years at 20k = 92k
stick with student loan since it was an average not based on time = 27k

A potential difficulty, however, is that I'm not in a financial position to take anything like an unpaid internship.

I worked for a small company (~30 users) for 10 years. I went into this job as sales, but there were only 3 of us and I was the only one who knew anything about computers. After the first year, I did everything technology related; research for new hardware/software, networking, copiers, etc. However, I was never really able to learn or implement a lot of stuff that I knew existed, our network was **very** basic. 


There were 2 reasons behind this: 1. The owner was a ""isn't broken, don't screw with it"" type of guy, after I got the server stable and the network running in the early years, he said no to almost everything I suggested. (protected environment for the server, offsite backups, exchange etc.) 2. IT was considered my 2nd job to whatever my actual title at the time was there. So when there wasn't an IT fire to put out, I was to get right back to work on my actual job. This got better towards the end (last 3-4 years) as we got bigger and things needed to happen in the IT department.


So while I feel like I was a ""System Admin"", I know that the knowledge/experience of a real system admin is far above mine. I am capable of getting there, I just know I am not there currently. Here is what I did:


* Network of 2 severs / 35 clients / 25 users 
* Made all technology purchases (researched / proposed / purchased / installed)
* Set up new users / computers
* All computer / tech problems came to me for resolution
* Cable installation


**PLEASE HELP**, I am trying to find a job now and I can't even get call backs for helpdesk positions.... I believe this may be because of not knowing what to call myself and when they see a big title with a long history at one job with basic skills, they just say WTF and toss me aside.


On top of that, the owner kept telling me I'd never get fired and that I didn't need to go back to school. I drank all the koolaid, FML.


TL;DR: was sys admin for 10 years, i'm not a skilled sys admin though, what am i?


**EDIT: Thanks for all the affirmation and the suggestions. Seems like I need to rework my resume a little to take ownership of the things I really did accomplish there. That and I need to get back to school and get some certs while I'm at it. Go to school kids, even if you know your stuff and you've got a kush job. It could all come crashing down one day.**

So basically, I'm currently in a 4-year degree program for CS. I'm currently registered to earn a BS and a minor in math. The only problem is that this summer, I finally realized that I like learning on my own a whole lot more than I do when I have to take classes, turn in homework, and worry about grades. Furthermore, I spent all year teaching myself everything from the assigned textbooks and basically sleeping through classes. I did better last semester than I did in the previous two. 

I really love math. I read textbooks and wikipedia on my own. And I really love writing code and ""building"" things that work. I have no problem with slamming my head against something for hours and finding an out-of-place semicolon (a behavior I replaced with looking at StackOverflow after a few minutes of frustration have passed).

I also currently have a job/internship working for a startup in Silicon Valley (though my branch, one of two, is based on the eastern seaboard). I write test scripts in Python for our already released software. 

Now, currently, I have a personal project that I am working on, without any influence from anyone else, based on a new approach to analytics using some non-conventional mathematics, but I want to write in in C/C++ instead of Java or Python (the main languages I know) for efficiency reasons. I want to spend as much time as I can working on this, and then dive into my other interest, graphics, once it's done. The only problem is that with my BS/minor scheme, I'm going to be slammed with classes for the rest of my college career (3 semesters). I could drop the minor and have an easier load, and drop the BS to a BA by not taking linear algebra, physics 101 and our course for circuitry and computing at the lowest level. I am already midway through one of the MIT lectures series on linear algebra, and I have the Hennessy book for computer design. Physics is cool and interesting, but it's currently not my main interest (though it will be once I have some more free time). 

Here is my question: if I want to ""go places"" in programming, what would you recommend - that I take a whole lot of classes that aren't necessarily related to whatever I'll be doing immediately after school or that are related but that I'd rather learn on my own, while risking my GPA sinking below a 3.0 out of 4.0 so I can have the ""S"" instead of the ""A"" and a minor, or that I drop all of the unnecessary shit that I don't want to do and ""laserbeam focus"" on my interests, thus producing a B.A. with a slightly higher GPA, but also a github repo of code that I wrote on my own, having taught myself the necessary mathematics and programming  by reading StackOverflow, books, Reddit, Wikipedia, etc? My boss says I should go for the BS, but I disagree. 

A quick breakdown:

B.A. - Normal software engineering classes, operating systems, OOP focused class, two electives, basic statistics class

B.S. - Everything in the BA plus linear algebra, the low-level computing class and physics (or any extra science)

B.S and minor in math - everything in the BS plus calculus II and III, an additional statistics class and one other math class that I may not even be able to get because of scheduling.

It's a big and well known software company. I'll be working in a small department with some very cool and smart people. Here are some of my questions:

- I want to make a good impression. Any tips, besides doing my best?

-  I believe I'm a capable programmer, but I don't want to overestimate myself. How do I keep myself down on earth, humble and open-minded (not that I'm a cocky know-it-all)?

- How do you keep yourself motivated, if things are not going the way you'd like them to?

- This one is really important: I'm very pedantic and want everything to be perfect. This means the code itself must ""look nice"" (the code should be pleasant to look at - I know, right?!), use the best practices and optimal data structures, be bug-free and fast. In reality, this means my hacking is slow. For example, I tend to waste my time choosing a pattern A over a pattern B, even though both of them would work just fine and yield the same result in the end. I'd really like to overcome this ""problem"", which makes me inefficient. Any advice?

- If I think my solution is better that the one currently used (or advised), how do I explain it to the PM/lead, without offending anyone (also, see no.2)?

- I know I can't be sharp for 8h straight. How do you do it?

- There are days when you're just not feeling it - you can't get your engine running and can't get yourself to write some code. What then?

Thanks for all the help in advance.

Every few months I usually have a personal project I work on. Often it turns out that they don't get completed because either I lose interest, it didn't work out to how I wanted it, or I hit a roadblock and can't continue.

My question is that is it worthwhile mentioning these projects in interviews or even resumes. I could see on one hand that it's good because it shows I'm doing something but on the other hand it could show that I don't have the ""drive"" to finish what I started.


For example:
I was getting frustrated because I had to deal with each college's calendar and how it was difficult to add events from them to my own calendar. So I used Java to parse webpages from many different sources and compile that into a local SQL database. I needed the local database to sort events and take out duplicates (if an event was listed across multiple calendars). Then all of the events would be uploaded to a Google Calendar account. The web interface (was in progress) was going to be a nice interface that allowed students to tag events (e.g #freefood), a few other features,  and within a few clicks the event could be added to the user's Google Calendar account. I had lots of trouble making the web interface because I found jQuery/HTML/CSS not as easy to deal with as I thought it would be. At some point I got discouraged and worked on it less and less and focused on school, work, etc.

This was meant to be a simple, easy way for users to easily look at an event aggregated from multiple sources and let them add it to their own personal calendar.

So this used basic Java, basic SQL, good knowledge of Google Calendar API, jQuery, and web languages.


I definitely learned a lot from the project but there wasn't an end product. This project definitely wasn't ground breaking or gonna-be-the-next-Google but it was definitely fun for me and addressed a need I had.

tl;dr: unfinished projects, mention/talk about them? or just don't mention them

The school of engineering, for comparison, has a Computer Science and Engineering program with much of the same coursework that awards its graduates a Bachelor of Science degree.

My school promises that the difference in degree type has no bearing on future employment and graduate study prospects since it's still a degree in Computer Science, and most employers and grad schools don't really care.

Need some honest opinions from a non recruiter.,tronMouse2,12,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ii60i/questions_for_someone_early_in_their_career/,"*note: posting from an alias account.  And obviously, I'm not using names.

I'm a recent comp sci graduate with a little bit of personal experience that includes an iOS game and a few functional websites.  Now I'm pretty junior and went to one of those colleges where they taught very little about real world programming.  So confidence going into the job market during the 09 economy clusterf*ck was low at best.  And right now, I have a little over 1 year experience that includes 3 jobs. 

* The first one (a small company) was a bust as the owner/manager was an a**hole and wanted me to work 80 hours a week on some non-stop multi-threaded application that three other junior level programmers couldn't even complete.  Heck this was a place that had a horrible reputation on job listings as being one of the worst places to work.  Long story short, I only lasted there a few months.

* The next job was a big change as I was now working on a contract for a small business.  The difference is that I was trained and they taught me a hell of a lot more about programming then school ever did.  I did a great job and got along great with my co-workers (fellow geeks with same interests, no surprise) and manager.  After 9 months, the contract ended, and I had enough experience and knowledge where I was pretty confident to do most tasks.  My lead even gave me a reference to help me out.  I mean, I basically knew enough to implement most complex web apps.

* My last job was working for another small business (this time 3 developers), this time on a full time (and should be) permanent basis.  It was a very social company where my bosses and stuff talked about things like news and TV and stuff.  I'm more of a quiet person, as I'd rather just get my work done and not really deal with anything else.  I was told there were no deadlines and so I used some of my time to get familiar with the language (they were using a new language/framework that I never studied).  Of course, this changed as my lead started to push me to get my small project 1 done.  That was fine, and I tried getting it done that week.  He then gave me another small project 2 which I started working on.  A few weeks in they were bringing the small project 1 into production as one of the sales guys needed it to sell to a customer.  So they brought me in to help install it.  Ignoring a few installation hiccups on my part it installed fine.  I did that and then gasped as the damn thing stopped working.  Considering my lead was implementing a new clustering environment for the production servers, I wasn't too surprised.  But my lead and the sales guy where.  They were freaking out and basically had me sit there all with them as I tried to help debug the problems (they were all server clustering issues BTW, none my fault).  While I did get the project 1 to work eventually on production, this started a long long road of awkwardness in the office.  Every day there appeared to be less work for me to do.  I would ask for new work and they would awkwardly tell me to continue testing.  And eventually for a few weeks, I had nothing to do but test my old projects and try to find any kinks with em.  I knew this meant the end of my days there, but no *good* job prospects popped up before they let me go.  They said they would give me a reference when they let me go, but a few emails requests later revealed they were full of shit.  They claimed I was let go because I was too *junior* and would have trouble doing later work, but I have trouble believing that.  I did every project they asked to the best of my ability and tried to get everything done as fast as possible (when they actually revealed deadlines), I was also willing to put in overtime should the need arise, and give help to other developers (they were working heavy overtime on a separate project which I could have absolutely have been useful with), but they let me go all the same.

My question is this, should I be worried?  I'm no genius, but I would assume 3 jobs for less then one year is enough for my resume to draw some red flags.  Especially when two of them were only for a few short months and won't even give a reference (not that I would want them to).  And while I do have a bunch of personal experience in stuff like iOS, a personal ajax website (which will never take off lol), and some android apps, work is were everything counts and I'm starting to get worried.  I'm interviewing like crazy right now, but I'm thinking that one more bad slip up like this, and no one's going to want me to do their work.  I'm also going to try to screen the companies better to avoid bs like this.  I'm also thinking bigger companies (and the government especially) won't pull this kind of cr*p as often.

I really enjoyed it and now I am pretty sure I want to go the Ph.D. route. 

Thing is, as much as I love my school, I'm not particularly interested in the research in our Dept. I know it's not the name of the school that matters, but it'd be amazing to study at a top school like Stanford or CMU for grad school.

I currently have a 3.8 GPA (3.95+ if you exclude my first semester) and study on a full-ride scholarship (which is why I came here).

I work part time at a software dev. place on campus, making Android apps. It's not particularly satisfying because the apps I make are usually related to gov't applications, which gets kinda boring, but it pays and its good experience. 

I do have some research experience, mostly in Human-Computer Interaction, and will be submitting my second research paper to a conference soon. 

My GRE scores are decent (162 verbal, 161 quant, 5 writing), all of which are in the 90%+, except my quant score, which is in the low 80th percentile, so I'm a bit worried about that. 

I'm really passionate about CS and enjoy programming a lot. Would any of you know what my chances are at getting into a top CS grad school?

Would you hire someone without a degree?,flexd,13,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jtel2/how_much_do_grades_matter_when_doing_a_bachelors/,"I hope I'm posting this in the right place, I was considering posting in r/jobs.

I am currently a (soon) 3rd year computer engineering student, and tomorrow I am re-taking one of my exams from last semester due to the fact that I got an E.

There are circumstances that partly explains my grade (5 hour exam split between two topics/classes, part 2 should have had 5 hours of it's own), and I have had months to prepare for tomorrow but due to pretty much just lack of motivation I haven't really studied at all.

To be honest I was demotivated before my exams last semester, maybe it's just a combination of me being sick of school and something else, who knows.

While I hope I'll improve my grade tomorrow it is possible that I will be left with an E on whatever report card you have when you finish a bachelor.

1. **How much would that affect you hiring me if you were looking at candidates?**

2. **Will my code/open source projects matter when it comes to getting a job?**

For my own sake I really do not care if I have an E on my card. Do I wish I had a better grade? Sure, but it really does not matter for me. I started studying to have an environment and opportunity to learn, and to meet other students interested in the same things. I knew I could probably learn a lot of the topics on my own. All of the things I have used at work (part-time) I have learned myself, and while having classes at school has taught me a lot, for example my algorithms and datastructures class, most of my knowledge comes from being interested in a topic for my personal projects.

Other than this class and two others (basically one class of two other semesters) my grades are usually A or B's.

**About me**

I have been coding since I was about 13-14, which ends up being over ten years now as I am 25. It's mostly just been something I've picked up over the years and something I enjoy doing. Computer has always been an interest of mine and I could probably be able to truthfully claim that I've spent more hours coding than I have gaming since I discovered I could create things.

I have a [GitHub account](http://github.com/flexd) and I try to help out on open-source projects whenever I can.

Anyway this has turned out to be a bit long blob of text, english is not my first language so feel free to comment any oddities.

I'm going to actually start reading to refresh my memory about this exam now, I hope you guys have some feedback :-)

I have had PHP web development internships in the past, and this summer, I got a really nice internship at a financial company in downtown Chicago as a Systems Engineer Intern. I'm talkin' $60k salary as an intern, catered lunches, super casual work environment - it's pretty much the perfect atmosphere for me. I'm able to start working full time come January, and they have heavily alluded to me that they'd like to pull me on full time at that time - if that's what I want.

The catch: I really, really would like to have a development or programming role versus this ""Systems Engineer"" role. Object Oriented programming is just more interesting to me. The Systems Engineering role is a lot of software configuration, deployment, Linux administration, and scripting. It's interesting, and requires a very high level understanding of how our software and hardware systems work as a whole, but I'm not utilizing the programming skills I've built up in the past. I thought it might feature more programming on a lower level, such as driver implementation or messaging systems, but that's a role I've learned that's encompassed by our Software Developers and Software Engineers.

I go to DePaul university. I thought it was an excellent program, especially the masters classes I've taken so far, but I've realized that the people at my company who are Developers are students from MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon. I'm competing with the big leagues. If I want to try and apply for a more developer focused position, there's going to be a LOT of heavy competition, and I'm not prepared right now. I really need to review a lot of stuff from the past couple years of schoolwork that I've done, and I need to step up my game and develop more personal projects with any free time I have.

It's top-tier work, and I want a bite of the action. I could always apply to some web dev or application dev job around here and probably succeed, but I'm hungry for that foot into the door to the financial industry.

First time posting here because there is something bothering me for more than one week and I'm looking for some serious advices.

I work in IT for more than 10 years and for the last 7 years I worked exclusively with open source and free technologies. I didn't choose this path, it just happened and I really love it. I started as a software developer working with PHP and nowadays I'm a system architect working mainly with Python and Java.

I recently received a job offer to work with Microsoft technologies (.Net, ASP.NET) and I'm really tempted to accept it because it's a **huge** amount of money, but at the same time I think that maybe I won't be happy doing this after some time.

Unlike some friends of mine that despise .NET or Microsoft in general, I'm not like them. I think we can do some nice stuff with C# (I'm a Java guy but I like C# as well), .NET, etc but I never thought I would be working with these technologies for a living. I not even have Windows installed in my personal computers (I have Ubuntu in my desktop and I have OSX in my Macbook).

I'm torn because I don't see any future if I stay in my current job. Yes, here I have a chance to work with what I like, but apparently there's no room to improve my career. At the same time I'm not sure if there's space to improve in my career in the company that offered me this new job, but at least there I'll receive a lot more.

Call me greedy but would you work with a technology that you're not a big fan (I'm not saying that I dislike .NET) for an obscene amount of money?

Thanks!

First time posting in this subreddit but I've been reading it for the past few months (posting with a throwaway). Company A is in Akron, OH and company B is in Cleveland, OH. Commute time for company A is 25 minutes, B is 45-50 minutes (with Cleveland traffic I estimate it being closer to an hour).

I got my first job offer with company A (~$45K) earlier this month and formally accepted it (signed offer letter and emailed them), even though it was a tad bit lower than what I wanted but still more than enough to live comfortably off of in my area. I didn't end up negotiating the salary because I wasn't quite prepare to discuss it when I got the call. I really like the culture of company A and the freedom that comes with it (it's a small company, &lt; 40 employees, all developers/engineers, and it seems like it will be a very flexible and enjoyable place to work). 

Another company, B, just got back to me yesterday with an offer that is ~$12K more than what company A offered me. I liked company B (It was my second choice as far as which ones I liked the most, A was first) but the commute time is roughly twice as much as with company A, and there isn't as much freedom and flexibility. I would still prefer to go with company A, even with the lower salary due to the freedom, culture, and commute time. 

What sort of options are there for me in regards to company A? Is salary negotiable at this point? Or did I screw myself by not negotiating sooner? The only reason I accepted so soon was because the interviews were so far apart and I knew I wasn't going to be hearing back from any of the other companies any time soon (plus the fact that I really liked the culture/freedom of company A). Otherwise I would have waited a while until getting other offers and using those as leverage for negotiations.

The University of Texas gives me scholarship money, and its tuition is famously inexpensive, so my attendance there would not be much of a financial burden to my family. Also, I have been accepted to some extremely well-regarded honor programs there, one of which has a purpose statement of ""providing a computer science education second to none."" I absolutely love this university already—I've visited it monthly while it continues to grow on me—but it would be silly to not consider my other option seriously. After all, I've always wanted to get out of Texas.

Despite being way far away from Texas, Cornell is probably similar to the state school in academic opportunity. However, it has a reputation of rigorous classes and workloads, and that is something that excites and attracts me strongly. If money were not an issue, I would go for Cornell. However, tuition there is four times the amount at the University of Texas, and, since my parents are divorced, the financial aid office will certainly *add up* the incomes of both families, probably resulting in a calculation of very little financial aid.

I do not want my mother to pay a dime. Her family has to pay for my siblings there. My father can afford up to 30k annually, which is about half the cost of attendance. Perhaps, over the summer, I can earn money through internships, which might take away another 10,000. Would it be wise to try to resolve the rest of the yearly 30k (an amount that will probably inflate annually) through scholarships and, more importantly, through student loans?

Furthermore, are there any additional advantages to attending Cornell that might make the extra costs worth it?

* I have taken a class for PASCAL programming and enjoyed it immensely, but beyond that, I have no experience besides the occasional PSP hack or android rom debugging. I can navigate command prompt with ease. I just thought that since I enjoy math, technology, and computers so much, it seems like a logical career path for me.  Any of you come from little experience to full blown senior software developer and if so, how was the climb?

* I also heard that the job market for this particular line of work is sluggish and almost non-existent. I have also heard that it is booming. What is your take on the subject?


* I have my choice of which college to go to, but I don’t know where to go. I have no idea which colleges rank higher than others in the computer science field. Does it really matter?


*  I have a couple of options in mind that are close to my residence, University of Utah, Utah State University, and Weber State. Are most of the colleges going to have a pretty similar curriculum or is every college going to be different?


* Of which of those colleges would you recommend and why?


* Should I just bite the bullet, move to Cali and go to school down there for more career opportunities?  Is there enough desire for this career in Utah?

Combine that with not caring enough, not taking school seriously, etc., I ended up with way more credits than I really needed and a final GPA of 2.3.  

My very last semester I ended up taking Java from a teacher I wasn't aware of earlier, and I liked it a lot, and got an A, which resparked my CS interests.  I then figured out that the same school offered a ""software programming"" certificate which I could get, and the only additional classes I needed were a 2nd java class (I took android development, which counts), and a structured programming design class, both of which I'm currently enrolled in, doing well, and enjoying.  

I hope to go to a local school (Aurora University, I'm in the Chicago suburbs area) to get a computer science degree, but I'm concerned that my GPA is going to prevent me from moving forward.  I talked to a counselor at my current school, and the school in question does not have a set minimum GPA for their CS program, and is not listed as ""competitive"", unlike NIU, another school in the area.

Having said that, the main CS employer in my city is the Defense sector which pays handsomely if you can get in. It's easier to get in for CS grads than SE grads. 

When it comes down to the degrees themselves, the main differences are:

* The subjects problem solving &amp; programing, programing fundamentals, data structures, web engineering and UI are covered at a more advanced level in the CS Degree. 

* Software Engineering has a course on .net development and mobile app development (which many jobs advertised seem to favour).

I graduated from a state school with a BA in Language and Applied Economics (I studied French and Arabic specifically). Well the job market for International Trade dried up before I graduated [ThanksObama.gif] so I worked retail and then got into political work. I then got into social media management for political candidates.

A couple moves later, my wife lands a great (political) job, and I have the rare opportunity to pursue anything I want, focus on my studies, even learn new skills and change course without working, so I'm doing just that. I've decided that I want to get into development.

I figure that learning computer language/code is like learning any other language. It sucks and is incredibly hard at first but you eventually get the hang of it, and you can do more beautiful and fun things with it.

So I'm teaching myself basic HTML and CSS and should be done within the week. I'm also learning C++, and plan on learning Java, JavaScript, Asp.net, and probably PHP. I don't know what I'd study after that.

I'm also going back and studying Calculus and all the necessary maths on Khan Academy and other sites.

Having said all that, I want to be the best web developer I can be. I have the time and resources to pursue this, although I cannot go back for another Bachelors right now.

So far my career plan is this:

* Learn and practice languages, coding, and math as much as possible.
* Build projects and work on opensource stuff as much as possible to create a portfolio.
* Network with other developers
* Perform an internship(s), maybe even unpaid, to get relevant experience (?)

I'm young, and I believe I've got a good mind to learn these things.

All of that said. What can a person who has technical capability without a degree in CS expect in a career? Does the lack of a degree hold people back?

Also, how do most people transition with Web development? Do they stay with it or do they move to other areas? 

**TL;DR** *What can an aspiring web developer expect without a degree in CS? Do you think it would be better to focus on some other area of development instead of web developing, and why?*

Basically, I'm in my second year of college and have been at a financial firm doing Help Desk for the last seven months. It's a great gig, decent pay, flexible hours (As long as I work 20hrs/week during school, 40hrs/week during break), fun staff to work with, and both the CTO and COO have hinted at me moving up to dev in the next six months or so. Based on all of that I plan on sticking around here till I'm done with school.

However, I was also offered a position doing QA for a software development company with no minimum hour requirements, equally good pay, room to move up, and incredibly flexible hours (Basically come in whenever I can). 

From a CS Career perspective, would it be worth taking the second job on top of the first and school? It would probably up my workload to 30 hrs/week plus school then 50 hrs/week out of school which would pretty much mean no social life at all.

One of my professors has recently taken an interest in me due to exceptional performance in his programming classes. He suggested that if I'm serious about making a career out of programming (I am), that I switch my major from Computer Technology to Computer Science, as he felt this would provide me with a better shot at securing a good job. After browsing the differences between the Bachelors in CS and CT, respectively, I have found that the differences in the degrees are miniscule. The CS degree will provide me with a few extra upper level math classes and a few graphics design and 3D animation classes. While I wouldn't mind the extra math classes, I do feel like the graphics design and animation classes are not necessary, as I do not plan on working on such things in the future - my focus is strictly on programming with possibly minor dabbling in GUIs. 
So, my first question is, will obtaining a degree in CT rather than CS be detrimental to my career going forward? 
My second question, which I will try to keep short, is as follows. I have several upper division classes in Java coming soon. With the animosity that surrounds Java (the government urging everyone to disable their Java plugins and such), is Java really on its way to being phased out? Will I be wasting my time by learning the Java language? 
TL;DR: 1) Is a degree in Computer Technology considered less valuable in the programming field than a degree in Computer Science? 2) Is Java on its way out, or will it still be beneficial to learn this language?

Here's my scenario. 

I'm graduating in about a week. Long story short, I didn't declare CS until the beginning of my junior year, but was able to fit all requirements of the major in with one extra semester tacked on to the end of my time as an undergrad. It was a lot of work, but it turned out nicely and was well worth it. So now I'm getting my diploma in December.

Anyhow, I haven't done much job hunting as of yet. I did have an interview yesterday for an internship with a smaller company. They liked me, and gave me an offer on the spot. It's basically for a web development position in a start-up like environment at a new branch of a moderately sized company. It would be from January 2nd to June 28th, 40 hours a week, $20/hour. Not so bad for an internship, I guess. But technically, since I'll no longer be a student, I'll be hired as a 1099, an independent contractor.

I have until January 2nd to accept this offer.

On the other hand, I have a few larger companies, like Epic, that have reached me through the university recruitment process and want to set up phone interviews. I've also got a handful of other companies that I'd like to apply to for full time positions, and have a few friends in the industry that have graduated before me and referred my resume, etc. I'm already on the path to some more interviews, for salaried positions.

My question is this: Would taking this internship now be detrimental at all to my long term career? Should I turn down this offer and spend these next few months on a full time job hunt?

Or should I take the ""no experience is bad experience"" mentality, and accept this internship in the meantime? I'll get more industry experience, more time to work on personal projects, and more time to prepare and apply for permanent positions. There's also the possibility that this company may offer me a full time position when my time as an intern comes to a end.

I spent this past summer interning at a smallish software company a short drive from my university, so I have some internship experience under my belt already. It was also mainly web application oriented work. 

Anyway, I guess I'm a bit reluctant to pass up this sort of short term stability of landing a paid position immediately after graduating, however temporary that position is. I feel like it could be used a stepping stone of sorts.

Is taking the January to June internship now while also using that time to apply for full time positions with a start date in July a wise move?

I know I'm in a fast moving industry, but being at a place for less than a year is still a big no-no from what I understand, unless it's horrible and you're experienced enough that the (presumably longer) time spent at other jobs on your resume makes up for it. That's the kicker, though... I'm actually very experienced (started teaching myself to program at 13, started professionally coding ~17), but this is my first full-time, salaried job after graduating with a CS degree. I'm a young, adventurous 22 year old, but I feel like my age is a hindrance. Instead of looking at my professional qualifications, companies tend look at my graduation date. 

So that's my situation: just waiting things out until I feel like I have enough time with this company written down on my resume so that I can finally find something better. How long should I wait? My 1-year anniversary with them? 2-year? The last thing I want to do is get a job and then look sketchy to new employers for trying to get another so quickly.


**TL;DR:** I have &gt;= 5 years of professional programming experience, and I dislike the current gig I've had for 8 months, but it's my first salaried job since getting my CS degree.

It seems the area I live in doesn't have very many opportunities in the field of software development. Recently, I've been looking at a lot of county jobs and I'm having trouble understanding whether or not I should even attempt to apply for them.

For instance, one listing says ""Programmer Analyst I"", so I assume the ""I"" makes it an entry level job, then I read further and see that they want two years worth of related experience, which I don't have. On top of that they post things like ""the ideal candidate will have 5 years experience in..."", basically invalidating even their two year requirement.

Anyway, here are my questions:

1. If all jobs I've stumbled across have similar time requirements, how do I find an entry level one, or should I just apply to these anyway?

2. I've looked on DICE and LinkedIn and basically everything I see has basically the same requirements for these level one positions, is there any place out there designed specifically for entry level positions.

The pay is ok but not great, however I get a nice discount on tuition (studying CSE).

Recently though, there has been some changes made... the ""research unit"" I work with went from being an anthropological data collecting group to more of a lobbying/policy group with a lot of unfortunate ties to D.C. ... Our directors are getting old and relatively useless and there seems to be an infinite amount of confusion around our offices lately....

The most drastic changes lately have come in the form of job responsibilites and unqualified management. I currently am the only ""computer guy"" in our small office, and I haven't written a single line of code in about 3 months. Instead, I've been asked figure out why someones palm pilot from 1999 no longer works, why the University wont increase our exchange server storage quota, or to organize all photos on our server. 

This morning I arrived to find an email in my inbox marked ""EXTREMELY URGENT"" asking me to come solve a computer issue with one of our 'researchers'... which turned out to be that they couldn't remember how to change their desktop background in Windows 7 and needed to change it before giving a lecture.

I can't help but feel like I'm being turned into our IT support person now. I absolutely **LOATHE** doing IT ... i don't enjoy helping other people with computers and getting yelled at for their mistakes (I did 2 years in a IT/help desk call center when i was younger.... i know the drill) ... and part of the reason I got into web-dev was be able to keep working with computers while I finished school without completely losing all hope &amp; dignity.

The pay is still at the Web-dev rate, and I get to keep the developer title on my resume, but I really can't help feeling cheated. How can I let my higher-ups know the difference between a developer &amp; IT guy...?  Should I just abandon all hope and look for a new job? Should I just suck it up and keep learning on my own? .... any suggestions would help guys...

Anyway, a few questions. I have half a year of classes left and then a thesis. Currently, I'm pursuing a mix of courses with a slant towards theoretical computer science. So that is algorithms and AI. I'm doing this out of personal interest but also since I'm of the oppinion that to be able to work closely with developers I need to know what they are doing. This does come at a cost of more SE or BA like courses. I've done a few and I try to teach myself the rest in my spare time and when it makes sense on the job. 

Any thoughts on my reasoning? Should I spend more time on in-depth studies of stuff like requirements analysis, business process modelling, software architecture etc?

I'm half way to my 8th year as ""The IT department"" for a small travel marketing company. It's my first job straight out of college and there's no growth. My position is the only position there is (well there was an IT manager, but he left and they're not looking to fill that position as it's not needed). I'm unsure of what I can get from here because I'm now a sort of ""jack of all trades, master of none"" as far as IT goes. I am the entire IT department. I do all PC repairs, development, desktop support, project planning, server maintenance, liaising with 3rd parties for outsourced projects on technical level etc. Being that it's a fairly small company, there weren't any major projects to work on, so I'm not sure if I've got all the right exposure to go on to a job where the requirements are specialised.   

I don't have 7 years .NET experience, but in the 7 years I've been working I've worked with C# and VB, albeit not extensively. Same goes with SQL 2000 and 2005. I was never able to focus on mastering on single skill as that wasn't my role and I was needed for various things. If I was trying to develop or fix something and just got ""in the zone"", I'd get a call from someone saying ""my emails are not working, please fix it"" and then when I was done sorting that out, something else would pop up. By the time I'd get back to my desk I'd have completely lost where I was or would have just lost my train of thought. By the time I got back into things, it would be a rinse-repeat of what happened before.

At the beginning it was all well and good, the pay was fine, the work was okay and I was quite comfortable. There were challenges and lots of new things to keep me busy. Now, not so much. Since there's no ladder to climb there's also no promise of a substantial pay increase. I now feel unchallenged and since I've recently gotten married, a pay increase is somewhat needed.    
    
As far as qualifications go, all I got was a dev diploma, but even all the things I've studied/qualified for, I haven't used in all my time here (Java, Oracle, C++), and I've forgotten most of it (especially the complicated, advanced things) and all that I do work with, has been self taught (VB, C#, SQL 2000/2005, and I'm trying to pick up some PHP) and are only simple things. Getting qualifications for what I use or even getting a degree is expensive and I don't have the time or cash for it. Both wife and I work and neither of us earn enough to be able to support each other if the other studies.     
    
What I know I'm good at is solving problems. Any problems, which is probably why I've become so versatile in my responsibilities. The people I work with know I will sort their shit out (which is also sometimes not cool, since ANY problem they have they come to me with). It's the one thing that gets me excited. I enjoy tackling something I haven't before (which is possibly why this job is becoming so dreary for me). PC repairs are second nature, since I've been breaking and building PCs since I was a kid, but since this is a hobby, I wouldn't like it to be my defining skill. Dev is pretty quick to pick up (when I have time) but my problem here is that in my 7 years here, I've picked up bad habits since I was a 1 man dev team and had to develop ad hoc. All I would get pushed for was for things to work rather than to get things to work efficiently and well designed. So I really have no idea if my shit is good or bad.         

I am dev, testing and QA. There isn't anyone else who would/could review my work, since the IT manager who was here was just a generic manager (""you need to do this"", ""have you completed this?"", ""this doesn't work, you need to fix this"", ""hey this works pretty well""). Though I would be a bit bold and say that my bug finding skills are pretty decent.

I need to know what type of job I can look for if I intend to move from a situation and environment such as mine. 

If there's anything that I need to clarify let me know.

TL;DR: 7 years exp as 1 man IT department. Various skills. Nonspecialist. Need help finding a better, challenging job.

I graduated in Spring 2011 with a dual major in Computer Science and Computer Engineering from University of South Florida at a 3.77 GPA. I've worked in Java, C#, and C++ with free time spent on client side web development (JS,jQuery,CSS,HTML) and some basic Python. **Essentially, I love exploring, learning, and exercising all the technologies I touch.**

I already had a job lined up for late June as an Integration Specialist which is categorized as Software Developer here (flight simulator company). I soon found out there was very little development and the job was mostly high level testing (flipping switches and illuminating lights powered by very basic in-house scripts), documentation (dummies guide on how to X the systems), and general PC troubleshooting. This applies about 0% of what I learned in university and offers nothing I could carry over into a development role, much less one outside of the simulation industry (it's a lot of special purpose hardware and software).The pay is good (maybe? 54K for a new grad in Tampa) and offers quite a bit of fun travel (per diem, flights, hotels, rental cars and I get to keep the hotel/airline points for personal use... a year in Hawaii starting fall 2013 if I'm still here...), but the work is simply not what I want to be doing in the slightest. **I've spent more time with a screw driver in my hand than production level developing.**

In August 2011, I started the Couch to 5k running regime and wasn't really satisfied with the free apps on the Android Market so I decided to write my own. It has most of the bells and whistles I want (chimes, timer+distance transitioning, real-time Google Maps location, history using SQLite) but it looks pretty bland. I haven't put it on the Market or github since development stalled while I was traveling (Jan-April) and using my company's laptop. The past few weeks I've been experimenting in C#, .NET, Javascript+jQuery, CSS and HTML on Elastic Beanstalk for fun. I know all of the client side stuff from years on userscripts and userstyles, and the C# and .NET from university. **I enjoy developing in pretty much everything I've looked at.**

This is where it gets good! I've been trying to apply to jobs in Seattle and San Francisco on and off since August and it's been pretty grim. At first I had my Dice profile with my real Tampa address and genertaed hits from all over the US *except* the West Coast. After talking to dozens of recruiters, one suggested changing my dice address to somewhere in Seattle. I did that, and it worked! (Note: I only changed my Dice address, my resume address was still Tampa). So lately I've been getting Seattle hits but every time my location comes up, they other side goes cold. A ""Director of Development"" from a startup-ish company contacted me over email and we really hit it off until he reread my location. I offered to fly myself out and stay a week on my own money (points accumulated from my current job) for the interview process and he STILL turned me down. I made the same offer to a consulting company who was greatly interested but they were said no, too. There have been plenty more but these two were reallythe most recent and most promising (like ""can you come in for an interview tomorrow?""). **Seattle has been impregnable from Tampa so far. Need more tactics.**

I interviewed for two separate Amazon positions and got denied after the second phone interview on both occasions. For the second process I was caught with my pants down during travel and no computer of my own... I froze up and botched coding over the phone while sitting in my car at my work's parking lot. **Botched Amazon interviews. I think I'm out of their ""new grad"" classification now. Still trying.**

I'm pretty sure my resume can't handle another year at my current job and still appeal to development roles... So worst case is I pick up and move to Seattle close to the end of August. I'm about to completely pay of my new car, after that I can devote a **very** large portion of my paycheck to saving for the move and living expenses for a few months. I'm terrified of moving out there without a job lined up. **Moving with no leads seems crazy but doable.**

So yeah, any advice on how to land jobs across the country? Know any Seattle based companies willing to hiring non-local applicants (especially if the applicant pays his own interview fly outs and relocation?!)? Anyone been through something similar? **Any questions or advice will be greatly appreciated!**

Oh, I should also mention I've been to Vancouver CA for the past 3 years with progressively longer stays and even with the rain and overcast, I'd give up Florida's outdoors for the Northwest's in a heartbeat. **Weather is not an issue.**

I only know the very basics of only 3 programming languages.  Java, C, and Python.  Not enough to code anything fancy.  I have no projects outside of school because i don't like programming enough to do it outside of school.  I spend most of my free time working on recording and playing music.  I've been reading some posts here and have read that a lot of companies ask ""so what projects have you been working on, on your free time""  it makes me laugh to think that i would be replying with ""nothing"".

I feel like if i were to go in to a technical interview right now, i would not know how to go about doing anything, and would just stand there like an idiot.  Yet somehow, i've gotten A's on all coursework relevant to my major.  I still don't know how i managed to get any of that, surprises me.  I don't think it's a good representation of what i actually know at all.

so some might ask well then why are you a CS major?  Well the answer is because i'm doing it as a compromise.  I sit in front of a computer for a majority of the day so i felt it was natural to get a degree in something computer related.  I wasn't expecting this though.  The alternative career path i used to pursue (music) is not an option at this point, as it very difficult to make a decent living at it.

Oh and to make matters worse, the internship that i thought i had set up for the summer just fell through.  I need the internship for college credit, and without it, i won't be able to graduate when i planned to.

At this point i'm just taking it day by day, and trying to ride the wave as long as i can.

But I've been wondering: is a doctorate in Computer Science really useful outside of being an educator? I am a little burned out on school already (I know, just an undergrad man up and quit complaining and continue working, but I HAVE spent all my life in a classroom and it's getting a little tiring) but I have no problem dedicating a few more years to getting a masters degree, but I don't know if going even further and getting a Doctorate would be worth it. Is there a significant pay-grade difference?

My likes in the field are Software Engineering, the theory behind much of the maths and etc don't really do anything for me, sometimes the theory is interesting (such as my Neural Networks and Machine Learning class which led to the professor hiring me as a research assistant in the field) but usually I take the theory classes for the grade and don't pay too much attention (such as my current Automata Theory class. Boy is it rather boring). And though I don't plan on being a professor anytime soon I don't mind being a High School/Community College teacher later in life (preferably after retirement).

The only true reason I am even considering getting a Doctorate is because most of my family and professors consider me extremely smart,(I don't like saying it, because I don't see it myself. Although I'm good at most maths, Higher level Maths have been a struggle for me [mainly trigonometric Calculus]) and a cousin of mine whose ""smartness"" I am on par with is finishing her her Doctorate thesis (I believe it's kinesiology, or sports medicine, something like that. She's REALLY into exercising and stuff like that) in I think 6 years (from graduating HS). I would have been finished with my undergrad already, and probably half-way through my Masters, but living in Texas and having gone to two higher-education schools that have screwed me I've been delayed into graduating on a ""normal"" schedule. 

So recap: Doctorate or just Masters?

What do I do?",FuckYeah2011,15,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qd77s/started_a_new_job_realizing_all_the_code_was/,"I asked a similar question on GetMotivated yesterday, but I wanted to hear the opinions of some CS professionals. Basically, here's my situation:

On Monday I started a new job. I'm working on a product that has a lot of social networking integration, Twitter, Facebook APIs etc. It let's you build and publish Facebook apps, manage your social media accounts, and stuff like that. All very interesting stuff and that's what got me excited about it. 

Now, three days in, it's looking like I may have made a big mistake – the more I work with it the more I realize that the codebase (written in Rails) is a piece of crap written by people who understand next to nothing about software design. Have you ever seen people who come from a Java background and never really got the concept of object orientation in the first place write Ruby code? Yeah, that's what it's like. Full of spaghetti code, and code is coupled so tightly that when you make a change here, something breaks over there. Tests? Well, they're there, but not really being used. Case in point: when I run ""rake spec"" I get about 122 failing cases. When I brought this up, the lead developer just shrugged his shoulders and said they're all old anyways and a lot of things have changed.

Other things I've learned - this project is about four months old, initially it was just one guy working on it, and he was on a contract. Maybe about a month ago, things started getting more serious and more people were put on. The lead guy got a full time position. Now, there is a hard deadline in the room of April 1st. This is when this thing is supposed to be done. For this purpose, they've been hiring a couple more developers (all full time), including me. However, there is not project management to speak of and nobody seems to have the skills. We're doing useless meetings that feel more like discussions about problems we're facing but no real decisions are made. No commitment, no ownership, and no motivation. 

Now, in my previous job, much as I disliked it in the end, I did at least learn a lot of good project management skills. We did a pretty stringent agile process with daily scrums and for all the flaws I still saw in it, at least we got stuff done, on time, almost every time. 

So, the question I'm facing is this: do I face this monster and start applying my management skills, or do I call it quits and run for the hills?Is this thing salvageable or is there no hope? 

I'd especially appreciate to hear from people who have been in a similar situation. 

**TL;DR: After starting a new job, I am realizing that the codebase sucks pretty hard. How bad does it have to be to call it quits?**

EDIT: Just got out of another meeting. Depressed faces all around, and I keep hearing words like ""hopefully"", ""forgotten"", ""I don't know"", ""maybe"", and even ""we're fucked (if)"".

What gives me the biggest pause in making a jump back to a programming role I think is my age relative to my programming abilities.

I am going to be 40 this year and have been in the IT field for about 10 years (about 6 programming).
From everything I have read 40 is considered ""old"" for programmers.
Many companies will hire the young college grad (or just young in general) knowing they will be able to pay them less and get more effort out of them.
Someone who is 40 and aging will have a family and expect to leave at 5 or 6 in order to spend time at home. Which, to be honest is what I WANT to be doing at my age.

Also, my overall programming ability compared to my peers is HORRIBLE. As I stated above I have been in IT for about 10 years and feel I should be at architect level by now.
I still have trouble cobbling together basic Grails apps. Not to mention I can't recall the last time I even developed a web application from scratch. 
Although, I am currently working on a Grails applicaotn and did bulid a Spring JMS application for my current job.
For someone with my years of experience I should be able to understand good application design and know when to use certain patterns in a program.
If I were to spend another 5 years trying to obtain this knowledge I would be 45!! (wow I am getting old). I worry what is going to happen if I have to look for another job.
I will likely not have the experience necessary and on top of that be the ""old"" guy.

Now, with my current role I feel like it's a balance between technology and business. If I were to stay in my current role I would be more of a tech lead and build some sort of management experience I could take elsewhere.
With some type of managing I feel I could move out of tech if it were necessary. If I were to go back to programming I would be just another developer not even a senior developer at that.

The biggest thing I think is I am worried about age and ability. At my age shouldn't I be leaving programming to the younger ones who WANT to pull late nights and study all weekend?
On second hand moving into a managerial role and sitting in meetings all day is just NOT appealing at all.

I've got one tech (who used to be my boss/manager..) under me, and together we take care of anything and everything IT for a ~150 employee organization. 

Experiences here include: Cisco switches, Windows Servers, SQL, desktop maintenance and repair, running cables, VoIP phones, exchange server, vmware, GIS, etc. Everything from 'install this printer' all the way up to 'deploy this multi-server application to all desktops using GPO'

A little backstory. I'm currently 23yo, been working here for coming up on 4 years. Started as a part-time tech, graduated to full-time tech, then ended up in the IT manager spot due to some political bullsh.

Experiences I've enjoyed:

* Finding unique solutions to technical problems. Example: writing an update trigger to automatically populate data.
* Deploying a new application across the organization
* Creating scripts to compare information in databases, instead of printing them out and having the secretary do it by hand
* Talking with the higher-ups to streamline operations way outside of IT's scope

However, there are some distinct things that I dislike about my current position.

* Phrasing a document just right, so that management will approve what I already know I need.
* Anytime the phone rings, it's because something else is broken, and I'm never going to get through my queue of stuff to do.
* Users getting irate that things 'aren't done right' even though 10m ago I was getting complimented for the changes I've made
* Perpetually trying to put new policies in place so that users don't hit their head against the wall, and then patching said wall a week later after they blatantly ignore it.

I realize some of those issues are going to be with me no matter where I go in IT, however they feel like they're aggravated by the managerial position, as well as the sysadmin part of it.

I've noticed that I enjoy programming. I like writing the SQL triggers, the python scripts. I've also got some side-projects as well.

So, **my question is, what's it like on the programming/development side?** How different is it from this jack-of-all-trades thing I'm doing now? Is there inordinate amounts of red tape between you and writing code that you have to wade through?

EDIT: figured I should add a little bit more backstory.

I've written 'programs', in the loose sense of the word, before. Input, output, storage. I've written scripts to compare tables and move data back and forth, written my own ajax/python horrible hack thing for a chatroom, written a few smallish games, etc. I like programming.

However, I've never gotten into any of the 'heavier' stuff. None of my projects have gotten big enough to need classes or to have to really worry about scope. I've never had to write documentation, other than little comments so I can figure out WTF this line means the next time i run across it.

I feel confident I could learn it, and pick it up fairly quickly. (All of my programming is self-taught.) However, I'm not sure what I need to learn, and I don't know how much I can prepare other than just jumping in. I also think I could potentially be a valuable asset, since I've seen the sysadmin side of it.

I have two back-to-back phone interviews with Amazon tomorrow and I'm panicking. There is simply too much to review when it comes to programming. I'm a decent programmer, but lack confidence. I would imagine Amazon is interested in sorting and searching algorithms, so that helps narrow things down a bit. I know how the following algorithms work: binary search, linear search,  merge sort, insertion sort, quicksort, bubble sort. I've heard Amazon is interested in scalibility, which I don't know too much about. In terms of code optimization questions I do not have much experience either. I can name the complexities of popular sorting and searching algorithms, but when it comes to coding on the spot, I get really nervous and blank out. After the interview I can comfortably develop a working solution (taking my time of course). I guess I'm just looking for advice from anyone. Amazon interviewees would be a great resource. Thanks!

EDIT: You guys were spot on with the advice. Round 1 went well thanks to you guys. Round 2 in 3 minutes!

EDIT: Round 2 not too shabby! Interviewer seemed a bit young/new to the interview process, but he was pretty laid back! Not sure if I can share the questions with you guys, so I'll hold back for now. I didn't sign any agreement though.

I've been trying to decide which university I should pursue so I can plan my courses accordingly at a community college for this fall term before attending either of those universities for Spring 2014.  But not all the courses I am signing up for will transfer to both universities as direct equivalents.

I cannot apply for a BS at CU-B because I doubt I can get into their Engineering School because that would require taking more classes at a community college and I don't want to do that considering I am 24 already.


Here are some reasons why I am having trouble:

*If I chose CSU, I would be able to get my Business minor by taking 4 more courses.

*Boulder is more expensive but I have to take out loans regardless of which school I choose.

*Since Boulder is a better ranked school, I assume it might give me better opportunities for internships/job opportunities. 

*After doing a little research, I understand that a BA vs BS does not matter too much but it seems like it would still be better to get a BS for the extra math and CS courses.

*I'm trying to decide on the last course I should sign up for at a community college.  A computer science course will transfer as a direct equivalent to CU-B but not CSU.  So it is either CompSci course or take a general ed course that will fulfill CSU curriculum.

I have a mix of post-baccalaureate classes from a top-tier university in a large city (Java, C/C++, algorithms, some others) and self-taught skills.  I have no professional experience programming and currently work as a secretary.

About a week ago I started sending out my resume, and yesterday I got a phone call (my phone was off) and a subsequent e-mail from a recruiter about a position.

I understand recruiters probably e-mail tons of people about these positions and I'm just one of many, but I don't really know how to respond.

While I'm desperate from a job, I'm reticent to express interest in a job that doesn't match my experience.  The client wants someone with a strong Java core, and I feel mine is okay, but I don't meet the other qualifications.  Some acronyms were listed that I didn't even know at first glance what they were.  After talking to a friend of mine (who has been in the field for 3 years) and looking up what everything was, I feel I could teach myself these things and could probably perform in the position.  

I don't know where to go from here.  Responding with the truth ""I don't know how to do most of these things, but I feel I could teach myself"" doesn't exactly sell me well for the position.  My friend's opinion is that I should take two days to learn the basics of the technologies mentioned that I don't know (I would probably focus on Javascript and refresh on Java) and respond saying that I feel myself fit for the position and mention that I have been learning the technologies and would continue to self-teach.  While this is great and all, I don't know, it feels weird.  Maybe I'm overthinking it.

The intro to the job posting and my responses to each:

• Do you have between 1 and 3 years of experience writing DHTML and Javascript in a J2EE/JSP environment?

*Nope*

• Can you code attractive dynamic HTML pages? Solid experience of client-side Javascript?

*I have some experience making simple pages with HTML/CSS.  I have used some simple JS that I got from some googling, but I can't write it from scratch/memory.*

• Experienced with AJAX and/or web development GUI frameworks such as GWT, ExtJS, YUI, etc?

*Nope*

• Do you have good experience developing web applications in a three-tier environment using J2EE technologies and Spring?

*Never even heard of Spring before this posting...*

• Know SQL? Have developed JSP against a Sybase, SQL Server or Oracle database?

*I have watched some intro to SQL videos on youtube, downloaded SQLite and started playing with it.  JSP?  Nope.*

• Want to work in a small dynamic team guiding your software from design, through implementation, into a production client environment?

*Sure, yeah, sounds like a good place to be for a beginner like me*

• Do you like an environment where you can own development of a component from start to finish and see how your work directly benefits the users of the system?

*Sounds cool.*

• If you’ve answered yes to the above then this is the role for you!

*Uhhh*

My friend says that everyone feels underprepared for their first developer job and has to learn a lot of new things, but I just don't know how far that should go.  I realize no job is going to fall into my lap that is the perfect fit for me, but I also don't want to sound like a desperate idiot to the recruiter by expressing an interest in a job that isn't really for me, even if I believe myself *eventually* capable of performing that job.

Basic info:

- CS degree from New Mexico Tech.
- C+/B- GPA with a few terrible semesters (F's, D's, College party semesters where I slacked off/didn't go to class/didn't do homework... 2.44 overall GPA, C+ is 2.33 by how they calculate it).
- Basically 0 web-dev experience, short of some minor PHP, HTML, and CSS modification of CMS/Forums.
- Great grades in weird/hard topics like compiler writing, neural networks, sensor networks, embedded systems design.
- TA'd/taught some of compiler writing (with great reviews).
- Did some basic Java programming and real-time linux kernel modification at a part-time job for an observatory.
- Partially completed some grad school (this feels like a last resort and not really what I want at the moment).
- I live in a tiny town in a rather unpopulated state.  There's a whopping 2 jobs listed for my entire state on stackoverflow.  Thus I'm almost guaranteed to need to move somewhere else for work.

Every job I've found seems to be web development with a bunch of technologies I've never used (or even heard of, most of the time) and have zero experience in.  Many of them state things like ""Have a great Github account with contributions to..."" in them.  I'd love to contribute to some stuff on GH, but almost all of it, as well, is web-dev.  I'd even love to have a portfolio that extends beyond what I made in college.

What is there out there for a compsci like me?  Are there any ""entry-level"" jobs that are actually entry-level and don't require 3+ years of experience?

I am a student living in San Francisco. Two days ago it was announced that following this school year the college I am attending, a two year university, will be losing its accreditation. I have a minimum of 1 1/2 years left before I can transfer, so you can see where the problem begins. 

Currently my school is the only option within San Francisco, as far as I know. There are other two year schools but they usually have their students transfer to my college and then to a four year after that. 

I am somewhat hesitant to transfer to another two year institution and lose my current progress, but not totally turned away by the idea or sure that I WOULD lose the progress. That is just a worst case scenario. 

My current school still has the option to appeal the loss of accreditation and I will be working hard with everyone at my school to make sure that we stay open and I can avoid all of this. However, I'm making a contingency plan.

If my school were to close, would it be practical, with enough experience, to begin working internships in San Francisco instead of transferring to an out-of-city school? I'm willing and eager to self-teach programming and would prefer to not have to restart my college education. The problems that I've heard on this subreddit, concerning no degree, is that it will probably bite me in the ass somewhere down the line. 

Working internships while transitioning into a job at any of the companies would be a dream, but I understand that it may not be practical or the best option. I am willing to hear other opinions/suggestions/experiences similar to this before deciding and I still have an entire year before the school (possibly) closes. 

Thank you for your time and apologies if all of this was slightly incoherent.

edit: going to add my experience since I figured someone might ask. I'm currently self-teaching Python and am decent with it.

The physical education is something I probably need to take anyways, but the speech class is loaded with busy work, group projects etc and will ultimately slow me down by one class I could have been taking toward the BS degree.
