The woman at the desk gave him his key and told him that on the way to his room, there was a door with no number, that was locked, and no one was allowed in there. Especially no one should look inside the room, under any circumstances. So he followed the instructions of the woman and proceeded to his room and going straight to bed.

The nest night, his curiousity struck him and wouldn't leave. He walked down the hall to the door and tried the handle. Sure enough the door with no number was locked, he then bent down and looked through the keyhole. Cold air passed through it, chilling his eye, what he saw was a hotel bedroom, and in the corner was a woman whose skin was completely white. She was leaning her head against the wall, facing away from the door. He stared in confusion for a while, he almost knocked on the door, but decided not to.

This disclination saved his life. He crept away from the door and went back to his room. The next day, he returned to the door and looked through the keyhole, this time, all he saw was redness. He couldn't make anything out of it besides a distinct, red colour, unmoving. Perhaps the inhabitants of the room knew he was spying the night before, and had blocked the keyhole with something red.

At this point, he decided to consult the woman at the fron desk for more information. She sighed and said, ""Did you loook through the keyhole?"" The man nodded and told her what he saw. Then she said, ""Well, I might as well tell you the story. A long time ago a man murdered his wife in that room, and her ghost haunts it.."" She then whispered..

My wife had been a narcissistic madwoman who wasn't capable of taking care of herself, so our divorce was more or less a blessing to me. When we had separated, I was granted custody of our young son, who was my entire life. During our marriage, my wife had complained that I spent too much time doting on him rather than her, who apparently thought she deserved acknowledgment. Having that witch out of the house and away from my boy had many advantages about it, but it also had some drawbacks. I was working all the time, so often I would hire a babysitter or call my parents and see if they could watch my son. I usually tried to get my parents to do it, but every now and again I had to settle with Marcy, the only babysitter who was ever available on short notice. I never particularly liked Marcy, as she was always a bit on the irresponsible side. Marcy would often spend most of the time babysitting on the phone rather than paying attention to my child, and every time she saw my car pull into the driveway she grabbed her things and left through the back door… She was a pain. But she was all that was available.
One night, I stepped into my home and I called her name, but there was no answer. I assumed she must have left through the back door again, so I paid no attention to her lack of answer. I walked into the living room and saw that at the top of my stairs was my son, still in his pajamas.

""Hey, sport,"" I called to him, before noticing the look on his face. ""Something wrong, son?""

""I had a nightmare, Daddy,"" he told me, before running down the stairs to hug me. ""It was so scary…""

""What happened in it?"" I asked. He hugged me tighter.

""I was walking down the hall when I heard the sound of Marcy humming downstairs. I hid in the dark of the tops of the stairs where she couldn't see me, and I spied on her doing her homework in the kitchen. After a few minutes, the pantry door behind her opened silently. She was listening to her little music thingy, so she didn't hear it. Out of the pantry there was this naked monster man with tiny little black eyes…"" he shivered.

""Go on, son,"" I cajoled.

""Well, the monster man watched her for a long time, and then he waved his hand at the closet in the living room. It opened, and another monster man came out of that door. She was focused on her homework and her music and it was dark so she didn't see him either. The two monster men watched her for a while before the second monster man waved at the window. The curtain was pushed away, and there was another monster man behind it. Marcy didn't see him either… so then, the third and second monster men waved at the basement door, and two monster men came out. I was so scared, Daddy… but I tried to be quiet and none of them saw me.

""They all watched Marcy for a few minutes before the one right behind her started growling. She didn't hear it. It growled louder. She made a face and blinked. I was praying that she wouldn't turn around, Daddy. But she did. She screamed and screamed and cried and screamed, and all the naked monster men ran up and started attacking her. They ripped her into pieces and ate them all… and when they were done they licked up all the blood on the floor. Then they all nodded at each other, and they all went back to where they were before…in the pantry, in the closet, behind the curtain, in the basement… and I just sat at the top of the stairs, I was so scared Daddy…""

I pulled the boy closer as he softly began to cry. I gave him a soft kiss on the cheek as I tried my best to comfort him. ""…Then what happened, son?""

""… I… I went to leave and get the neighbors to help. I thought that if I ran fast enough to the door, they wouldn't catch me. I ran as fast as I could… but they all jumped out at me, Daddy. They were so scary. They grabbed me and were about to eat me when… when…""

""What happened, son?""

He stuttered as he attempted to weep out the rest of the tale.

""You can tell me anything, son… what happened?"" I stroked his hair as he began to compose himself.

""I… I… I told them that if they let me go… I would stall you when you came home, so they could get you too, Daddy… and spare me.""

All was silent for a moment. And in that moment, I could hear a series of doors opening all around the house. My son buried his face in my chest.

Pretty much, you can use a proxy service like Tor or i2p and find all kinds of stuff you wouldn't normally find, like places to buy guns or drugs. Anyways, I was browsing a AskReddit thread about weird stuff on the internet and a few people mentioned "".onion"" sites. Interested by all this, I decided to download Tor and lookup a list of sites to visit. I found one site advertised as a black market. I thought this was pretty cool, so I decided to browse around. People were selling Meth, guns, hits on other people, and stolen goods. I was about to leave but then a post titled ""free4u"" caught my eye. I clicked on the thread and all the post said was ""lots of fun4u!!!!!!!! free dl enjoy :)."" Below the text was a link to a file called fun.zip. Now, keep in mind, it was like 2 AM and I was really bored, so I downloaded the file and ran it through a few virus scans. Nothing came up, so I decided to unarchive it. Inside were a lot of videos and pictures. I decided to click on one called ""banaman.avi"" and watched it. Not too much to it, just some guy in a banana  suit for 4 minutes. I was interested enough to keep on going, so I clicked on a picture called ""steven.jpg"". It was just some guy sitting at his computer looking bored. I opened a few more pictures with peoples names on them, and they were almost all the same. Just someone sitting at their computer looking bored or doing something like carrying books or walking into the store. I was getting a bit creeped out, but I decided to press on. I watched a couple more videos, one was some kids walking to school, another was a man reading the newspaper on his couch. I'll skip to the more interesting ones now:

""goodnight.avi"":
Two boys, maybe like 7 or 8 are brushing their teeth in their pajamas. They seem completely unaware of the camera, as it is filmed from right beside them. They finish brushing and rush off to bed. For the next 9 hours it views them sleeping. Nothing else.

""payment.avi"":
A middle aged man is walking down a dimly lit street during the middle of the night. Again, this person is also completely unaware of the camera. He comes across a teenage girl and begins talking to her. The sound is muffled, but it must be bad due to the growing look of terror on the girls face. She tries running but gets shoved into the wall by the man. He grabs her phone and backpack and runs off. The video goes on for four minutes of the girl sobbing in the street then ends.

""stolen.avi"":
A teenage couple is seen watching a football game at what is presumably their high school. The game ends and the crowds leave except for the couple who decides to remain at the bleachers. Once everyone leaves the couple kisses a couple times and then the boyfriend whispers something into the girl's ear. She keeps saying no but he keeps on saying ""C'mon"" and ""It will be fun, all of my friends have done it with their girlfriends."" The girl tries to leave but is grabbed by the boy. At this point, everyone that was at the game has left and the field is mostly dark. The girl's boyfriend slams her against the back of the bleachers and takes off her pants. He begins to violently rape and beat her for the next 15 minutes. The girl has a black and and a bloody nose and is sobbing on the ground. Her boyfriend begins to stomp on her head and kick her in the stomach. Some gurgling noises are heard from the girl but after a couple more stomps they stop. Her head is completely stomped in, and her clothes are covered in blood. The dumps her body in a trash can behind the bleachers along with his clothes, puts on his PE uniform, and walks away. The camera points at the trashcan for 15 minutes, then the video ends.

At this point I was completely freaked the fuck out and deleted the archive and decided to go to sleep. I feel asleep almost instantly, but didn't have any dreams at all. I went to school and didn't tell anyone what I had seen. Lots of people asked me why I looked so freaked out, I just said I was kind of on edge because I didn't sleep a lot last night. I was beginning to think that I had just had a nightmare and was talking things way too seriously. After lunch though I felt my phone vibrate. It was a text from a number listed as ""unknown"" saying ""u like?"". I tried to call but I always just got a busy signal. I figured it was just a wrong number and didn't let it bother me. Things were pretty normal for a few days until Thursday came around. I got another text from ""unknown"", except this time it was a picture. It was a picture of me in my 3rd hour class. I instantly freaked out and went on a computer to try to find the post I saw Sunday night. I looked everywhere but the thread was nowhere to be found, and no one was talking about it. More pictures started rolling in. Some were of me, others were of my friends, family, and some people that I didn't even know. I went to the police and they said that they would try to trace the number, but they considered it low priority so it would take a couple of days. I texted all my friends asking me if they were playing some kind of fucked up joke on me, no answer. I tried calling them and it just went straight to voicemail. I decided I would just go home and look into my browser history to find the post so I called my mom. Again, just straight to voicemail. Even though I live pretty far from the police station I decided to run home like my life depended on it. I got home and turned on my computer and just saw one file, ""morefun.zip"". With great fear I opened up the file and inside were pictures and videos of all my friends and family being tortured and mutilated. Images of my mom with her eyes ripped out and impaled on sharp metal rods, my friends with their jaws ripped off, fingers cut off and jammed into their eyes, and videos of them being burned alive. I was going to call the police but one more image caught my eye. It was entitled ""hello.jpg"". Created about 15 seconds ago. It was me, looking at the images, with a man with blood splattered clothes standing behind me with a Camera.

1337930752.0,196,self.creepypasta,u460m,Sanctuary,,223,27,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/u460m/sanctuary/,"I'd been thinking of the zombie apocalypse all my life- like any 20-something year old man. And what would you expect? Zombies have infected-- pun unintended-- our media to the point where they're their own genre.
Dead Island, Left 4 Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland and a million other zombie movies and games had all gotten me prepared for the zombie apocalypse ten times over. I weighed my chances realistically, thinking I'd be fodder and the first one eaten.

I wasn't so lucky.

When the outbreak reached an international scale, it was too late. I'd planned everything- survival kits, triage kits, food that could withstand all kinds of shit and be cooked in an instant, several firearms, a baseball bat, machete- hell, even some throwing knives. All in all, I'd had about 50 pounds of gear in case World War III broke out, or some other global catastrophe. 

I'd always hoped for zombies. I'd always hoped *I'd* be the one who would fight off droves of screaming, shambling horrors running for me, taking them out one by one with a desert eagle while the rest of my ""crew"" encourages me to get into a safe zone. Hollywood brainwashed me into thinking the end would be just a lot of flailing limbs and gunshots.

No one ever thought they would talk.

They looked just like us- my mother, my neighbor, my best friend (whom, ironically, I would play Left 4 Dead together with) and the rest of them all looked so goddamn normal. They talked, they behaved... hell, for the most part, they were human.  No one would think that it would start off small.
""Hey, man, you've had that cut on your leg for awhile now. You wanna go get that checked out?"" I asked my friend while in the middle of laying waste to some nameless hoard. He told me it was fine- told me to lay off his ""cuts and nicks"". I agreed. 

I guess the first one always haunts you the most. I remember watching the ratio shift from human to zombie like it was happening before my eyes right now.

I saw him tear his entire family apart with his teeth. His mother and father were first- they were sitting at dinner, serving him his share of veggies when he jumped out and tore his mother's ear off and bit so deep into her neck, you could see red bubbles forming at the wound where she would try to draw air. The bubbles were what drained the color from my face. His dad was next, trying to save his mother, but getting his head damn near torn off with his teeth. I'm damn lucky I was on the other side of the table- I hid in his closet, thank god. His little sister-- she couldn't have been older than 8-- hid in the family bathroom, screaming and crying. The walls were thin enough so I could hear, but I heard something else;

""*Ariel? Ariel, sis... It's okay. Mom and dad... they were sick.*"" He was speaking. There was all manner of gore spattered on his shirt, and he was *speaking*? His voice carried empathy and security- the poor girl.
I had to hide- what else could I do? I heard the doorknob turn and the door creak, and then half a scream. It was cut off so abruptly I'd rather not like to think of how it ended.

And now, back in what I wish weren't the present, I find myself in the scenario I'd envisioned- I'm in a ""safe zone"" with a half-dozen ragtag misfits just looking to survive. I've got my equipment and my weapons- I wanted to have the time of my life. Instead, I'm crying myself to sleep every night.

The frantic, erratic movement never got to me. It was the voices. Zombies were always so fun because they were things we could kill without repercussions. Now, I spend my days listening to the pleas of the damned while wondering how good a round from the eagle tastes.

That's how Joe died- he had did all he could, the poor bastard, but one little girl brought him down. It was his daughter.

Her face was all torn up- half her lip was missing, her cheek was left with muscle tissue and one eye was a plain, milky white. All she could fit beyond our barricades was a tiny little arm, but her voice carried far enough;
""*Daddy? Daddy, I'm scared*"" she would whimper out. ""*Daddy, please don't leave me out here with these people. I'm so scared, daddy.*""

""Shoot her"" seemed like the obvious solution, and we tried. One of the women raised up a gun and pointed it at the girl's head, but Joe stopped her- he put a single bullet through her brain, had a few more words with his daughter and repeated the process himself. It got me thinking back to all of those zombie movies and video games- there was never a suicide option. Sure, a protagonist would blow himself up if it would take out a big group of them, but they never emptied the chamber through their own head.

I didn't even know the girl, but after three days of listening to her, we all wanted to die. I guess it was just cruel irony that the day after Joe made a new hole just below his chin with a magnum, the girl's voicebox had eroded. That girl's silence was the closest thing to ""relief"" any of us had gotten.

It had been over two weeks- they didn't try to dismantle our barricades, nor find elaborate entrances inside our sanctuary. No, they just passively clawed at our gates and spoke to us like we were Nazi guards and out there was Auschwitz.

It was supposed to be so fun- pumping rounds into hoards of faceless zombies and racking up the kills. It was all supposed to be so goddamn fun, but after two weeks of this shit, that bullet's looking tastier than my instant-canned-shit.

And then I heard it;

""*William? Bill? Sweetie, it's mommy! It's okay, you don't need to be afraid! Mommy's here!*"" It was my mother. It was the woman who had cuddled me when I was younger and folded my laundry until the day I moved to college. 

I could see her ribcage beneath her torn blouse- the gore and carnage told my eyes that it wasn't my mother, but those kind words... they had me wondering if it might've just been okay. I wanted to scream, to cry, but then she would just burrow into my head- I'd let her in with my doubts and she'd have me opening the barricades to let her and her friends in.

""*Sweetie, I don't want you to be afraid.*"" Funny how I would've blown a Playboy model into a thousand pieces if they tried to seduce me out of our safe zone, but I couldn't raise a finger now. ""*Please come talk to me? I miss you...*""

I hope my mother averts her eyes. One bullet in the chamber always looked like the quickest way to go. This won't hurt a bit.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1337964363.0,,,True,t3_u460m,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/u460m/sanctuary/,

(linked to abistigmata),hastalapasta666,195,40,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16se54/a_real_creepypasta_linked_to_abistigmata/,"Okay, so apparently I’m crazy. It’s possible. And I don’t mean like the kind of crazy those dumb little twelve-year-old weeaboos on the Internet claim they are. No, I think I might actually be losing my mind. I just... I mean, sometimes my imagination gets the better of me. Was this ever real? Does anyone remember abistigmata besides me?

I’d like to make this short, but I can’t. This is big. This is... real. Or so I think. Is it? I was told to make it a creepypasta, but the story is so creepy it really doesn’t require much effort to make it into a pasta. If you want to know what this is about, it's about a creepypasta reader who might have done more than just *read* creepypastas. But please read it.

Here’s what happened. It did happen. I know it did. It happened while I was watching one of theLittleFears’ videos on YouTube back in 2010, and I came across a similar video in the sidebar with an intriguing title. It was called “Don’t Walk Down Walnut Street.” Ordinary title for a creepypasta, but I live on a Walnut Street. So I clicked on it. The username was “abistigmata,” which I later learned was pronounced like “Abby Stigmata,” and the video had almost 200,000 views. The story was your average, run-of-the-mill creepypasta and it gave me nightmares for the next week.

The story wasn’t all that haunting beyond the usual “is-someone-watching-me” jitters that come with things like that. The scary part was the way abistigmata read it. He had the absolute perfect voice for reading creepypastas. It was this incredibly sexy and unsettling Eastern European accent, and he read the story as though he was the one there, but he wasn’t the victim--he was whatever was haunting the victim. That voice was what made him famous.

I soon learned that he had accounts on a few other websites besides YouTube--reddit and deviantart to name two--all with the username “abistigmata.” He was fairly popular for a creepypasta reader, with some of his videos getting around 150,000 hits, and I noticed that he had even done an Internet AMA on reddit at one point. I was enthralled by his voice, and I wasn’t the only one. Almost every single comment mentioned his smug, alluring accent, and I soon decided that I wanted to hear more of it.

As I worked through his videos, which started around 2005, I noticed periodically he would break character a bit and do an FAQ video--in his deliciously creepy accent, of course. There were five so far, from 2005 to 2010. I watched the first one, from 2005, and learned that his accent was Russian, where he had been raised before he moved to America. He was in his late twenties and lived alone. That was generally all he said about himself--the rest were about where he found the creepypastas, whether he wrote them himself, editing software and what have you. He was very conservative about his identity, which I admired, and made a point of never showing his face online.

abistigmata didn’t just read creepypastas. Sometimes he acted them out. Some were shot professionally, like a movie, but others were of the hand-held “Paranormal Activity” genre. There were only about twelve videos so far like that, and most of them only had one or two actors--never abistigmata himself, though. It seemed like they were collaborations from redditors or YouTubers or something, because in the credits, “special thanks” was always given to names like “annaxxholic” or “josho417” instead of people’s actual names. Also, notably, no same actor was in two different movies.

Listening to him read his creepypastas and answer FAQs, I started to feel a little odd about him. He acted almost smug, like he knew something we didn’t, and it bothered me. Instead of someone sharing the fear, it was like he was making it scarier. 

Two things I noticed about abistigmata, however, are what sends this way farther into creepy territory, and they’re why I need help finding someone else who knows about this guy.

One was the way he dealt with haters... or, actually, the way I realized he dealt with haters.

Like all YouTube stars, especially cryptic, tongue-in-cheek ones, abistigmata had tons of haters. The petty comments from 12-year-old trolls he left alone. But every once in a while, somebody would make a really smart-assed, venomous comment about, say, his unoriginality or his perfectly creepy voice. Those he would respond to. Mostly the hater would leave, and wisely so. But sometimes they didn’t. And if they were persistent enough, regardless of the topic or argument, abistigmata would leave one last line:

“I think I’ll make a movie today.”

That comment would always get top-voted and, sure enough, he would always make one of his acted-out creepypastas that day.  After a while, though, I started to notice something very, very off about that process.

It started about a month ago when I happened to stumble across a flame war still in its hottest stages. The argument this time was about, you guessed it, religion. Apparently, abistigmata was a Satanist or something of the sort and some kid named “TheJorMan,” also a fan of having the same name on many different websites, had taken issue. The argument itself was on YouTube, but when I clicked on TheJorMan’s channel I noticed that he had a reddit account as well. Being the petty-minded fangirl I was, I decided I would make a HUGE difference and downvote everything he’d ever posted. (I didn’t choose the thug life...)

I clicked on TheJorMan’s reddit account and did my duty, then returned to YouTube only to happily realize that abistigmata had posted his famous line. Feeling triumphant, I decided to cruise reddit for a while via TheJorMan’s account page. But when I clicked on it, I noticed something odd. It had changed. His comments were all erased, as well as his posts. When I refreshed the page, it gave me the broken reddit page a couple times before it brought me back to his user page, with his name listed as [deleted]. I found it a little strange, but I’d forgotten in about an hour.

That night, abistigmata made one of his acted-creepypasta videos. It wasn’t original, but it was creepy all the same. It was that old pasta about the hunter who finds a cabin filled with portraits that all turn out to be windows. Then abistigmata showed a part that wasn’t included in the original pasta. The hunter was running through the woods, panting so heavily it seemed like he was crying, occasionally glancing behind him. It was shaky camerawork and you could tell the actor was holding the camera. Then the hunter screamed, dropping the camera. It was angled in such a way that it caught his shocked, bloody face as if you were lying right next to him. Then the man was slowly dragged away, and the screen cut to static. 

I was about to click to another one of his videos when I noticed the credits and felt my insides jump. The only line was in plain white text, and all it read was “Special thanks to TheJorMan.”

Those were all the credits. I checked the description and there was no mention of any other actors or cameramen besides abistigmata himself. Nobody in the comments seemed to realize the correlation. 

I searched for TheJorMan’s YouTube channel, only to be told that it had been taken down, just the same as his reddit. It was obvious that I wasn’t going to glean anything from that side, so instead, I did some digging on abistigmata. I searched all of the twenty or so names given in the “special thanks” credits. Google, YouTube, even tumblr--all the accounts had existed in some place or another, but were now inactive.

I had been digging pretty deep back in the early 2000’s looking for clues and eventually wound up on abistigmata’s deviantart page. And that’s where, amongst his oldest drawings, I found the second thing that rattled me.

abistigmata had always posted really creepy drawings on his deviantart, and the early ones were no different. Then I stumbled upon a picture I wish for the life of me I had saved to my hard drive right then and there.

The title of the picture was “Dark Harbringer,” and it was the full version of abistigmata’s current deviant and YouTube profile pic. It was an original, heavily edited, black-and-white photograph of a shirtless man with long black hair taking a classic “mirror picture” with an iPhone in a filthy bathroom covered in blood. The man’s hair covered his eyes, but not his smug smirk, and behind him were a pair of sweeping, dark-feathered wings.

I was preparing to leave a comment when two things caught my attention. One was the date of the publication of the photograph, and the other was the fact that he was holding the iPhone.

It had been published in 2004, three years before the iPhone had ever been released. 

I checked to see if the picture had been edited. It hadn’t been. 

Then I did something that I never, ever should have done.

I messaged him.

I messaged abistigmata himself on every medium I could think of. I even made a tumblr to get to him there. Reddit, YouTube, deviantart, anything. I don’t even remember exactly what I said. It was something along the lines of “what happened to TheJorMan, and why is the Dark Harbringer holding an iPhone in 2004?”

I waited, but of course he didn’t message me back. I assumed he didn’t even check most of that kind of stuff.

After posting nothing for two weeks, abistigmata made another video. The normal kind, just a black screen with him reading a creepypasta aloud. 

But it wasn’t a creepypasta. I don’t know how to describe it. It was weird. It was unnatural. It was downright wrong.

It makes me really fucking freaked out even now just thinking about it. I must have listened to the goddamn thing thirty times, and my heart jittered like I had just seen a shock image every time. It’s the only proof I have, and it’s barely even proof. I’ll explain, but first read the transcript. I wrote it all down. On paper, so he couldn’t get to me. And with the accent. I just can’t write abistigmata’s words using th’s...

“You are a young kid. Sixteen, hair still almost blond, don’t even have your license yet. You’re even trying to convince yourself zat you need to shave. But really, Jordan, you are only a child.

“You’re not a gullible person, Jordan. You’re hardened, jaded by ze Internet, you aren’t scared by creepypastas, and you look down on people who are. And people who read zhem aloud, apparently, Jordan. You sit at your desk, typing furiously on zat sleek vhite computer your mommy and daddy bought for you. You foam at ze lips. ‘Stop liking zis guy. He doesn’t put any effort into his videos. He just talks. In a probably fake accent, too. Zis guy sucks, and for all his faggot fans, grow a pair. zeLittleFears and Marble Hornets are much better.’ 

“Vell, Jordan. Zat’s just rude, now. And you von’t even catch my hints vhen I respond, Jordan. But vhen I come for you, you’ll know. You’ll feel woozy. Ze screen vill go dark. And ze next sing you know, you are being blinded by ze bright light of a camera. You relax. Don’t relax, Jordan. It isn’t your friends playing a trick on you. It’s me. Just me. Don’t vorry about anysing, Jordan. I’ll take care of everysing. You von’t even have to move. You can’t, anyvay.

“You cannot speak, for ze hunter never uttered a vord. You can’t control your movement, your actions, except for ze fear. Ze fear is all real, Jordan, as it vas for Michael and Joshua and Rumer and Anna and all ze vons before you who dared push me zis far. And ze pain, ze blood, ze darkness vill be real, Jordan. 

“But not ze story. Because, as you know, creepypastas aren’t real. It’s all... just... an act.”

The reading was two minutes long, but the video lasted three minutes. I nervously scanned ahead to see if there was a screamer, but there wasn’t, so I sat through and watched thirty seconds of black screen before I heard abistigmata’s very distinctive voice again, even more smug than usual.

“Does zat answer your qvestion, Emily?” 

He was talking to me. He was talking to me through my computer screen and I know it because my name is Emily and I’m scared.

And I can’t find anything about him. Anywhere. His FAQ videos had almost a million views each and I can’t find anyone who knows who he is. 
And he knows who I am.

That video had four tags. The first was “Emily.” The second was my age. The third was “Walnut Street.” The fourth was “Four thirty five,” which was the exact time I had clicked on the video. And at the very end of the video, one sentence flashed so fast that I had to pause the video to read it.

“Can I have some ice cream?” the little girl, Holly asked after supper. “Sure” 

“Where’s the freezer?” 

“In the basement, so are the nuts, cherries and candy and stuff.” 

I went down to get the ice cream, and looked out the window to see a little girl standing outside. This didn’t strike me as too suspicious and I simply brushed it off. 

After I had given Holly her ice cream, Holly asked, “Can I have some hot fudge on this, please?” 

“Course,” was the quick reply. 

I went back down into the basement to retrieve the hot fudge, and again looked back out the window to see the same little girl, only wearing a red cape. I wondered if the girl was playing dress-up or something. 

“Got it,” I deadpanned after setting the hot fudge in the microwave and putting the thick chocolate goop on the ice cream. 

“Can I please have some nuts on this please…?” 

“Really?” 

“Puh-lease?” 

“Fine…” I sighed already heading back down the stairs. As I got the nuts out of a small cabinet in the wall I looked back out the window to see the same little girl in the red cape, holding a knife. 

Things where starting to get freaky. 

As I ran upstairs I decided I was calling the police. 

“Ooh Thank you!” Holly squealed happily from her perch on her pink Disney Princess booster seat. 

“Uh-I-I yeah. Hey, Holly, I need you to-“ 

“Oh no! Can I have a cherry on top, please?” 

Not wanting to alarm Holly, I decided that I would go get the cherries, then call the police after locking myself and Holly in the bathroom. There’s no way the little girl could get inside if the windows and doors were all locked. 

After slowly descending down the stairs, I opened the freezer with shaky arms. Daring to peek out of the window, I closed my eyes before staring out it. 

The same little girl, in the same red cape, holding the same knife was there. Only the knife now had blood on it. 

Running up the stairs, scared of what might await, I checked on Holly. 

Holly was dead, a small pool of blood forming on the floor under her. I ran into the bathroom and locked the door behind me before dialing 911. 

When the police arrived, the tearful mother and father were with them. The mother approached me, sobbing uncontrollably. “What happened?” 

“Oh God- I’m sorry oh God! I-I saw this little girl with this red cape and a knife outside your basement window!” 

The mother looked at me strangely and shakily said

1350841031.0,130,self.creepypasta,11unks,This actually just happened after I was reading creepypasta and got thirsty; this was a massive coincidence and I'm freaked out enough to post it.,SinkingIn,162,32,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/11unks/this_actually_just_happened_after_i_was_reading/,"Okay, so I live in a house of six people. Two of those are my parents, and the rest are my siblings. I'm the second youngest at 16 years old. There are two years between the next oldest/youngest sibling. So in other words There's a 14, 16, 18, 20, 52 and 53 year old living here.

My little brother has two friends over at the moment. This alone makes it weirder because his room is the garage at the opposite end of the house. They're both fairly large people, a good 80 - 90kg of fat. Not being mean, just realistic.

It's currently 3:20am here and this happened about 5 minutes ago.

At night, because we don't have a lot of money, we turn all but one kitchen and bathroom light off at night. The latter are left on so that people can see if they get up in the middle of the night. About half an hour ago I was out there and they were on.

Everyone bar myself are asleep. Everyone. I check because I am overly cautious at night.

So, minding my own business, with my lights off and my door shut, fan on and overly-loud cooling in my PC, I'm pretty isolated from the house.  I was just reading some creepypasta on here and all of a sudden my dogs barked. I have two. A staffy and some little chiwawa look alike that I adore.

I continue about my business expecting them to bolt onto the deck and bark at some partiers or possums, what they bark at every night. They don't. I think nothing of it, and then I hear the staffy growling. I yell at her to stop and she doesn't. I ignore it. She stops after about 20 seconds.

I hear an almost wimper then a bark again. I tell her to shut up. After a couple of seconds I realize I should comfort her, so I get up. I go to open my door, and I can't see shit. I actually jump in fear because it almost seemed as if the darkness jumped at me. It was overwhelming. I slammed my door shut, turned on my light, fell to the floor and breathed.

The lights are never off. My little brother warns his friends every night to leave them on as there have been robberies around the area over the last few years.

I grab my phone, switch on the DLSR-strength flash with an app, and I slowly aim it at the door. The dog's bed is about half a metre from my door, so I check on her first. She looks like she's been asleep for hours, barely takes notice of me. She clearly hasn't been aware. I convinced myself she'd been sleep-barking or something, so I switched on the light.

I looked around and nothing seemed out of place. Then I realized it was too quiet. The clock had died. Both of them. The TV's standby light was off. It's never off. It was as if all power in the house turned off but my room, which wasn't possible because I'm hooked up to the same powerpoints as the TV and kitchen lights.

The living room where my dogs are and the kitchen are side by side so I turned on the kitchen light. I jumped around just as the living room light turned off. I saw what I thought was a shadow and the light came back on straight after. No one was there and the dogs were still laying there, not caring, unaffected.

Am I crazy or what?

I went to check on my little brother and his friends, and they were all there. There's a large screen door that screeches when opened to his room and it was shut. It couldn't have been them.

I checked on all my other brother's, fast asleep. Something was seriously up.

I began walking back to my room, not touching the lights, and my dog jumped up and started barking at me. I tried to calm her, and she didn't stop. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun, flung my fist straight where I though a head would be.

Nothing was there. I turned the opposite direction and there was my mum. Asleep, on the couch, sitting as if she'd been there the whole time. The light switch is above her head. She wasn't there the whole time. I woke her up and she freaked. She wandered how she got there and I told her.

I walked her back to her bed and gave her a good night hug. I walked back out and my dog was just standing there. Still as anything. Staring at me. I checked everywhere, nothing was there. She barked. Once. I yelled at her but it was like I didn't exist.

I walked off back to my room and I'm now typing this.

I don't want to go back out there. Nothing can get through my windows as they're barred with metal but I'm still getting a feeling that there's something in here.

It is definitely one of the best scary stories I have ever read. It's a long one, so be prepared, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

During my childhood my family was like a drop of water in a vast river, never remaining in one location for long. We settled in Rhode Island when I was eight, and there we remained until I went to college in Colorado Springs. Most of my memories are rooted in Rhode Island, but there are fragments in the attic of my brain which belong to the various homes we had lived in when I was much younger.

Most of these memories are unclear and pointless– chasing after another boy in the back yard of a house in North Carolina, trying to build a raft to float on the creek behind the apartment we rented in Pennsylvania, and so on. But there is one set of memories which remains as clear as glass, as though they were just made yesterday. I often wonder whether these memories are simply lucid dreams produced by the long sickness I experienced that Spring, but in my heart, I know they are real.

We were living in a house just outside the bustling metropolis of New Vineyard, Maine, population 643. It was a large structure, especially for a family of three. There were a number of rooms that I didn’t see in the five months we resided there. In some ways it was a waste of space, but it was the only house on the market at the time, at least within an hour’s commute to my father’s place of work.

The day after my fifth birthday (attended by my parents alone), I came down with a fever. The doctor said I had mononucleosis, which meant no rough play and more fever for at least another three weeks. It was horrible timing to be bed-ridden– we were in the process of packing our things to move to Pennsylvania, and most of my things were already packed away in boxes, leaving my room barren. My mother brought me ginger ale and books several times a day, and these served the function of being my primary from of entertainment for the next few weeks. Boredom always loomed just around the corner, waiting to rear its ugly head and compound my misery.

I don’t exactly recall how I met Mr. Widemouth. I think it was about a week after I was diagnosed with mono. My first memory of the small creature was asking him if he had a name. He told me to call him Mr. Widemouth, because his mouth was large. In fact, everything about him was large in comparison to his body– his head, his eyes, his crooked ears– but his mouth was by far the largest.

“You look kind of like a Furby,” I said as he flipped through one of my books.

Mr. Widemouth stopped and gave me a puzzled look. “Furby? What’s a Furby?” he asked.

I shrugged. “You know… the toy. The little robot with the big ears. You can pet and feed them, almost like a real pet.”

“Oh.” Mr. Widemouth resumed his activity. “You don’t need one of those. They aren’t the same as having a real friend.”

I remember Mr. Widemouth disappearing every time my mother stopped by to check in on me. “I lay under your bed,” he later explained. “I don’t want your parents to see me because I’m afraid they won’t let us play anymore.”

We didn’t do much during those first few days. Mr. Widemouth just looked at my books, fascinated by the stories and pictures they contained. The third or fourth morning after I met him, he greeted me with a large smile on his face. “I have a new game we can play,” he said. “We have to wait until after your mother comes to check on you, because she can’t see us play it. It’s a secret game.”

After my mother delivered more books and soda at the usual time, Mr. Widemouth slipped out from under the bed and tugged my hand. “We have to go the the room at the end of this hallway,” he said. I objected at first, as my parents had forbidden me to leave my bed without their permission, but Mr. Widemouth persisted until I gave in.

The room in question had no furniture or wallpaper. Its only distinguishing feature was a window opposite the doorway. Mr. Widemouth darted across the room and gave the window a firm push, flinging it open. He then beckoned me to look out at the ground below.

We were on the second story of the house, but it was on a hill, and from this angle the drop was farther than two stories due to the incline. “I like to play pretend up here,” Mr. Widemouth explained. “I pretend that there is a big, soft trampoline below this window, and I jump. If you pretend hard enough you bounce back up like a feather. I want you to try.”

I was a five-year-old with a fever, so only a hint of skepticism darted through my thoughts as I looked down and considered the possibility. “It’s a long drop,” I said.

“But that’s all a part of the fun. It wouldn’t be fun if it was only a short drop. If it were that way you may as well just bounce on a real trampoline.”

I toyed with the idea, picturing myself falling through thin air only to bounce back to the window on something unseen by human eyes. But the realist in me prevailed. “Maybe some other time,” I said. “I don’t know if I have enough imagination. I could get hurt.”

Mr. Widemouth’s face contorted into a snarl, but only for a moment. Anger gave way to disappointment. “If you say so,” he said. He spent the rest of the day under my bed, quiet as a mouse.

The following morning Mr. Widemouth arrived holding a small box. “I want to teach you how to juggle,” he said. “Here are some things you can use to practice, before I start giving you lessons.”

I looked in the box. It was full of knives. “My parents will kill me!” I shouted, horrified that Mr. Widemouth had brought knives into my room– objects that my parents would never allow me to touch. “I’ll be spanked and grounded for a year!”

Mr. Widemouth frowned. “It’s fun to juggle with these. I want you to try it.”

I pushed the box away. “I can’t. I’ll get in trouble. Knives aren’t safe to just throw in the air.”

Mr. Widemouth’s frown deepend into a scowl. He took the box of knives and slid under my bed, remaining there the rest of the day. I began to wonder how often he was under me.

I started having trouble sleeping after that. Mr. Widemouth often woke me up at night, saying he put a real trampoline under the window, a big one, one that I couldn’t see in the dark. I always declined and tried to go back to sleep, but Mr. Widemouth persisted. Sometimes he stayed by my side until early in the morning, encouraging me to jump.

He wasn’t so fun to play with anymore.

My mother came to me one morning and told me I had her permission to walk around outside. She thought the fresh air would be good for me, especially after being confined to my room for so long. Exstatic, I put on my sneakers and trotted out to the back porch, yearning for the feeling of sun on my face.

Mr. Widemouth was waiting for me. “I have something I want you to see,” he said. I must have given him a weird look, because he then said, “It’s safe, I promise.”

I followed him to the beginning of a deer trail which ran through the woods behind the house. “This is an important path,” he explained. “I’ve had a lot of friends about your age. When they were ready, I took them down this path, to a special place. You aren’t ready yet, but one day, I hope to take you there.”

I returned to the house, wondering what kind of place lay beyond that trail.

Two weeks after I met Mr. Widemouth, the last load of our things had been packed into a moving truck. I would be in the cab of that truck, sitting next to my father for the long drive to Pennsylvania. I considered telling Mr. Widemouth that I would be leaving, but even at five years old, I was beginning to suspect that perhaps the creature’s intentions were not to my benefit, despite what he said otherwise. For this reason, I decided to keep my departure a secret.

My father and I were in the truck at 4 a.m. He was hoping to make it to Pennyslvania by lunch time tomorrow with the help of an endless supply of coffee and a six-pack of energy drinks. He seemed more like a man who was about to run a marathon rather than one who was about to spend two days sitting still.

“Early enough for you?” he asked.

I nodded and placed my head against the window, hoping for some sleep before the sun came up. I felt my father’s hand on my shoulder. “This is the last move, son, I promise. I know it’s hard for you, as sick as you’ve been. Once daddy gets promoted we can settle down and you can make friends.”

I opened my eyes as we backed out of the driveway. I saw Mr. Widemouth’s silouhette in my bedroom window. He stood motionless until the truck was about to turn onto the main road. He gave a pitiful little wave good-bye, steak knife in hand. I didn’t wave back.

Years later, I returned to New Vineyard. The piece of land our house stood upon was empty except for the foundation, as the house burned down a few years after my family left. Out of curiosity, I followed the deer trail that Mr. Widemouth had shown me. Part of me expected him to jump out from behind a tree and scare the living bejeesus out of me, but I felt that Mr. Widemouth was gone, somehow tied to the house that no longer existed.

The trail ended at the New Vineyard Memorial Cemetery.

I noticed that many of the tombstones belonged to children.

And most say that once you see the Reaper you are already dead. But this is not the case, for how would the legend be told if only the dead could see it? In truth the reaper doesn't know when you will pass, just when you might pass. So when you're crossing the street or running downstairs or in the shower, and out of the corner of your eye you see that black figure standing there for just a second before it vanishes, these are all times when your death is not only possible, but likely. And as usual you will eventually write it off as just your eyes playing tricks, or your imagination. 

But we all have experienced the time where you wake up in the middle of the night, and in the corner of your room or in the hallway or door it will be standing there. But its presence, if only for a moment, should be the least of your worries, for if it only shows up when there is a good chance you might die, your main concern should be what was about to happen before you woke up.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_w3rjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/w3rjc/the_reaper_delicious_pasta_found_on_4chan/,

I still see it floating around sometimes, but couldn't find it here, so I'm sharing.",Lasergoose,123,21,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/13xx7b/eh_oh_this_was_mine_from_awhile_back_i_still_see/,"“Eh-oooh,” Julia said, sitting in her playpen.

Dan could hear her sloshing her juice around in the sippy cup from across the room as she waved and attempted say “hello.”

“Hi, babygirl,” he said, lounging in the recliner next to the fireplace and looking intently at his laptop. He gave a half-hearted wave back, still reading the news.

As he switched between his multiple open windows, from a comic to stock listings to a news site, his daughter tossed the juice cup over the edge. He heard it hit the ground, glanced up quickly, but decided to deal with the cup later. Then he heard the rattling, as she picked up one of her toys.

“Eh-oooh,” she said again, her wave communicated to her father by way of rattling.

“Hi again, beautiful,” he said, offering a half-hearted wave back in the general direction of the playpen. He couldn't remember being this tired since Julia had been born. Despite the loss of sleep, the general frantic energy his adorable ball of joy seemed to possess was contagious. With Lisa gone for the weekend, though, the girl was taking her toll on the young father.

He'd spent that morning trying to teach her to play catch, her still-developing arms reacting on a significant time delay from reality. Then they'd gone to the park for a picnic, after an hour and a half of preparation, only to have to rush back home when it started raining. Some ridiculous series of videos featuring badly computer-animated insects dancing to Mozart had dominated her afternoon, and by extension, his. Anytime he wasn't shaking his booty to Wolfgang's phat beats, Julia would start crying. She'd gone down for an hour-long nap around 4 p.m., but that seemed to supply her with more than enough energy to try talking for the next four hours.

Now, at 9 p.m., Julia was up later than some teenagers. If Lisa were home, Dan knew the girl would already be sleeping soundly in her crib. But Dan took the “electric razor” approach to bedtime: once in awhile, let the batteries run out completely. The only catch was, his batteries were running out, too. He hoped hers went first.

He closed his eyes for a moment, and thought about calling Lisa. As the home's main breadwinner, she had her district meetings a couple times a year, but he knew that the events tended to be half-vacation. He didn't want to bother her …

He jerked his head back up. No. He was not going to pass out before his toddler. Maybe Julia could recharge his batteries a bit, though.

Slamming his legs down to shut the recliner, and jumping to his feet, he turned on his play voice.

“Hey, there, girl! Wanna try --”

“Eh-ooooh!” she cried, standing against the side of her playpen and gleefully waving her rattling, psychedelic-colored stuffed butterfly.

He shut up and stared at her, his dumb happy dad look frozen on his face. She wasn't looking at him, and she wasn't waving at him. She was facing the hallway to his right, on her end of the room, that led to the bedroom, nursery and bath.

“Um. Hey, there,” he said. “Over here! Hiiii, babygirl!”

She looked at him for just a moment, smiling the smile of someone who was already happy before you showed up. Then she turned her attention back down the hallway.

“Eh-oooooh!” she squealed, waving again.

He frowned, glancing at the hall from where he stood, even though he couldn't see down it. Then, looking back at the rapt joy on the toddler's face, he stepped closer.

Julia's attention down the hall seemed to fade as he got closer, and she plopped on her bottom and picked up a doll as he stood in front of the playpen and stared down the unlit, but obviously empty, hallway.

As a childproofing measure, they always shut the three doors in the hallway – the nursery on the left, the bedroom on the right, and the bathroom at the end. They all looked to be quite closed.

But Dan, who had always valued paranoia over false security, strode back to the mantle and grabbed the fire-poker from its stand, then returned to the hallway.

Holding the poker in his right hand like a truncheon more than a baseball bat, he didn't bother with stealth as he approached the nursery. He flung the door open, flipped on the light, and did a quick sweep of the room – behind the door and in the closet.

Leaving that door open, he went for the bathroom next. With slightly more hesitation, he opened that door and flipped on the light. The bathroom was small – efficient, Lisa said – and the only possible hiding place was behind the shower curtain.

Remembering a horror movie cliché so universal it was almost part of the human brainstem, he slowly stepped to the bath, held the poker with both hands, and hooked it around one side of the curtain. He forced it open.

Nothing.

He rolled his eyes as he stepped back out of the bathroom, leaving the door open and light on. Now, just one room left.

Now that he was this close, he realized he'd been wrong. His bedroom door was definitely ajar, if only by a touch – just enough that it didn't latch. He didn't imagine he would have done this.

He closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. Then he opened them and lightly kicked the door open. His left hand gripped the poker while his right scrambled for the light switch.

Finding it, he bathed the room in incandescent safety. There was nothing apparently out of place in the room, but he gaped at the opposite wall.

The window was wide open.

There was a moment of blind, frenzied, spiders-crawling-through-the-brain terror, and he held the poker up and spun around the room quickly, sure he'd missed something horrifying. Then, as he saw the damp floor and realized it hadn't been raining for hours, he remembered.

He'd opened all the windows earlier to save on AC. When they came back from their aborted picnic, he'd shut them all due to the rain – except this one. Julia had started crying for her movie just as he'd reached the hall, and before he'd gotten to his bedroom, he was out there turning on the classical music-loving bugs and dancing with them.

He quickly stepped onto the soggy carpet, went to the window and shut it, for all the good it did now. He needed to get some rags and towels.

Leaving the third door open, he started back down the hallway, eyes locked on Julia playing in her pen.

The next thing he knew, he was walking much more quickly down the hallway to Julia.

“Babygirl, what is that?” he asked, unable to maintain a play voice this time.

Julia was grinning, eyes wet and shining, clutching to her chest a teddy bear.

She didn't seem to be bothered by the bear's missing button eye, or split leg seam, or its dampness, or the smell of years of mildew, mold and rot.

Dan thought his face was going to fall off and hit the floor.

He barely mouthed a swear word, then out of some programmed parent response, didn't finish it.

“C'mon baby girl. We're getting out of here,” he said, scooping her up and becoming enveloped in the bear's stench. He wanted her to let go of it, but didn't have any intention of sparing the time to fight with her.

He held her with one arm and fished in his pockets for his keys. They weren't there. His already fiery panic almost consumed him, before he remembered he'd left them on the bench by the front door.

He made it to the door in three long strides, grabbing the keys and forcing his feet into some already-tied shoes, not bothering to pull the backs out from under his heels. He threw open the door and slammed it behind him. He didn't even consider pausing momentarily to lock it behind him.

As he approached his car, almost running, he hit the keyless entry button and heard the reassuring clunk. His head hit the roof as he slid into the driver's seat, Julia still over his shoulder. Screw the car seat just this once, he thought.

Keys were slammed into the ignition, car whipped into the road in reverse, all thoughts of seatbelts or possible destinations driven from his mind by the singular, overwhelming need to get as far from his house as possible.

A block down the road, he exhaled for what seemed like the first time in ages. And he realized Julia was breathing steadily, her cheek rested on his shoulder, arm pressed against his, the hand still clutching her new toy.

Despite everything, he laughed – one shrill, almost bark-like release of adrenaline.

Her breathing changed immediately, of course, as she woke back up.

He felt her shift her head, propping her chin up, her view now over his shoulder. A moment later, he felt her arm lift from his. In his peripheral vision, he could see the foul bear swinging wildly as Julia waved into the back seat.

There was a hunter in the woods, who, after a long day hunting, was in the middle of an immense forest. It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage. After what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing. Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached, and found the door ajar. Nobody was inside. The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning.

As he looked around the inside of the cabin, he was surprised to see the walls adorned by several portraits, all painted in incredible detail. Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred and malice. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.

The next morning, the hunter awoke — he turned, blinking in unexpected sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_wbovd,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/wbovd/the_portraits/,

It happens early, when you’re walking to school in the early morning sometime as a little kid, just learnt to read, looking forward to the day, and you spot a human figure as far ahead of the road that you can see. It’s human-shaped, standing in the middle of the road, but not moving. Your child’s mind subconsciously determines that it’s a woman. It’s too short for a man and too tall for a child. But it was too still to be human. For some reason you turn around and look behind you, seeing nothing special. Turning back, the thing is gone.


 It will take years before you see the next one. You have already forgotten all about the incident. You’re walking back home in the mist from your friend’s place, nobody in the streets, when for some reason you decide to turn around and look behind you. A figure, far far away. The mist moves, the creature doesn’t. You turn back around and halfheartedly start running. Glancing back, it’s gone. You jog your way home anyway, and blame it on the beer.


 You finish school and move into a new town. You find a job and a new place. Walking through the streets you notice an unmoving figure in the crowd. It’s a human, it has to be, but perfectly still. Others pass by as if they didn’t see it. You blink, and it’s no longer there. You only recall this with the next one, glancing behind you and seeing it there. It’s only been two years since the last. They become more frequent. And they always get closer. You see one only six months after the last. Three months. Six weeks. Three weeks. A week. Five days. Then one day you sense the one standing right behind you. You turn away and it’s gone.

The first time I saw that haunting, evil... thing was when I was about ten years old. It's been stuck inside my mind ever since, tormenting me every single day.

My mom and my dad had been through a lot of fighting at the time, and eventually, they divorced. Me and my younger brother (let's call him Paul) stayed with my mom, and my dad moved to his Mom's until he got engaged to some other woman Paul and I never got to meet. 

It had been tough for the three of us, but we eventually got through it. We moved to a smaller city, went to a new school, mom met her boyfriend, etc. It was like starting fresh. Paul was only eight years old, so he saw himself going into a brand new experience. Everyone was so happy, we laughed and joked everyday... Now that I look back to it, these three poor souls barely knew what was to happen to them.

There was this small plaza, no longer than a mile from my house, in which I went to when I wanted to be alone. There was only a few people there, and I usually brought my guitar to strum some tunes. It was there where I met my first friend outside the school. Her name was, say, Amy. She was about the same age as me, and we had a lot in common. Amy and I hanged out a lot at the local movie theater and at the plaza. She was fun to be with.

But there was this one day in which I was sitting on a bench next to her, and Paul (who had become great friends with her too) was sitting on the ground, and we were all talking about scary stories and such.

Amy loved scary things. She had collections and volumes of ghost stories, vampire legends, Frankenstein books, you name it, she had it. On that day, she suggested that we went ghost hunting at night around a small forest close to the plaza. As a fright night fan myself, I agreed quickly. Paul hesitated for a while, but decided to show us that he was a man and wasn't scared of forests.

Bad idea. To all of us.

It was one of these cloudy, dark nights in which you couldn't even see the moon, so it was almost completely dark. Amy had brought a flashlight. She didn't seem frightened. I felt uneasy walking by a place surrounded by trees at midnight, but held it in. I noticed clearly that Paul was shaking from fear. I told him if he wanted to go home, he could just tell us, but he rejected the offer and proceeded to walk faster.

It was all going well. Too well. A sudden rustling noise made the three of us jump. It looked like a huge bird had trapped itself on some tree's branches and struggled to get away. We stood dead still, wondering what the noise was. After the rustling had stopped, we head a screeching noise, like someone scratching their fingernails on a piece of cardboard. I glanced at Paul and noticed that he was pale. I took his hand, and he held it thightly.

After a while, we decided to walk forwards, just to see what the noise was, and get the hell out of that place. We jogged for what seemed like miles. Suddenly, Amy swung her flashlight to an old tree, and with a shaky finger, she pointed to three huge gaps on the trunk, as if someone had made deep cuts on it with a knife.

I thought Amy was going to run, but she... Laughed. She started to crack up so hard I feared she might awake a demon or what.

""Haha!"" she laughed. ""Cuts on the tree! CUTS! Like, heh, claws, maybe? Hahaha, oh man, this is gold. Gold!""

I actually thought that she was going crazy. She didn't stop laughing when Paul and I took her hands and ran away from the woods to our safe houses.

I got no sleep that night. What made these sounds? Why was Amy acting so weird? On my three hours of sleep, I dreamed of the scratching noise getting closer and closer to me.

I was awoken suddenly by constant talking and sirens outside. I didn't know the time, but since it was Winter, it was dark outside, and I couldn't see anything from my bedroom window.

I ran to my mom's room, but she wasn't there. All I saw was Paul, covered in my mom's blankets, hands to his face.

I asked what was happening. He seemed really shaken up, and the only thing he could mutter was:

""It's Amy.""

I opened the front door and looked at the scene. There were police cars, an ambulance, and about everyone in the neighborhood. The people were talking to each other, the policemen walked on and about the place, and I noticed right where they were standing.

It was at Amy's front yard.

I ran and looked for my mom. I sighed, relieved when I saw her figure approaching me. I asked what was going on. She looked at me with sympathetic eyes and said:

""Honey, Amy's house was broken into last night. We still don't know who it was, but whoever did it..."" she paused for a second. ""They killed her. She was found just about an hour ago, and she was... Eyeless.""

I was about to fall down. I felt this weak feeling of loss and confusion. I wanted to ask a billion questions, scream out loud in fear, too, but pulled myself together. I asked my mom about the ""eyeless"" deal.

""The killer pulled her eyes out. I just don't understand, why would someone do that to an innocent child?"" she explained.

I couldn't even say anything. Mom led me back to the house and I went back to bed. Of course, I didn't sleep, but rolled about the bed, crying, asking myself questions.

When it was about 9 AM, I got up and looked out of the window. I could see everything clearly now. The policemen were gone, and it was all silent. I was about to go do something else, but something on the window pane caught my eye.

Something, or someone, had scratched on the glass: **""YOU'RE NEXT""**. I froze on the inside. 

When my mom came into my room to see what I was freaking out about, there was nothing written there. Not a scratch. Mom said I was too shaken up with yesterday, and told me to do something that'd take my mind out of it.

About a week after Amy's death, Mom, Paul and me went to visit Amy's parents' house. I had made a card that said how sorry I was about the loss of their daughter (and also a good friend of mine) and Paul made a drawing of Amy, her mom and dad, and her sister, Lucy, all holding hands.

Lucy was fourteen years old. She had autism, but was always nice to us. She loved to draw and I must admit that she did pretty awesome for someone with her condition.

As Paul and mom chatted with her parents at the living room, I went to see Lucy. She sat on her bed, her face neutral. She toyed with an old teddy bear. 

We talked for a while. She replied to all my questions with the same tone of voice. It must've been hard for her to understand what was going on.

""Sweetie did it"" she suddenly said.

""Sweetie?"" I asked. ""Who's that?""

""I named him that"" she swung her legs. ""He was looking at me last night, through the window. Look, I drew a picture.

And then, she proceeded to show me a watercolor drawing of what looked like a tall, husky figure, with huge oval eyes and the biggest, brightest smile in the world. And he was on the other side of a window. And he was tapping on it, with his long, pointy fingernails.

""Why..."" I was shocked. ""Why do you call him sweetie?"" I asked.

""He wants to be called that."" she answered. 

But the second part of her answer was what scared me the most.

(Part 2 in the making) (I'll deliver, don't worry)

I was looking for a good, free game. I found a weird Russian website with a simple, black background. I had to translate the Russian, which said something like this: ""Free game. Very fun!"". I wouldn't normally download from such a weird and shady site, but I really wanted to play a game.

It took about 8 minutes to download, and when it did it opened WinRar and all there was a file that said ""Can'tTurnBack.exe"". A little odd, but if it's a horror game I don't care, I love that stuff. It started up without even asking to install.

""Hmm. I'm going to close it and scan for a virus."" I said. I was at the menu and it was just black with some blood splatters. It was in Russian, so I just clicked the middle button and tried to change the language. It worked, and the 3 menu options were ""Play"" ""Options"" and ""Exit"". I closed it and scanned it. No viruses, okay. So I opened back up and I noticed the menu changed and I got just a little scared. I saw some kind of, odd, pale, twitching...thing. Humanoid in shape, but that was the only thing that was even close to human. Instead of ""Exit"", it said ""GET OUT ALIVE"". I started playing and it was a crappy FPS with Doom-esque graphics. I played for about 10 minutes before stuff started getting...weird. There were piles of bodies...everywhere. I couldn't avoid them, they were literally everywhere. They started moving shakily, and twitching towards me in the game. I couldn't move. I pressed Esc and I exited the game- or at least tried. A message box popped up and it said ""Could not exit. You can't turn back."" I started to get scared, so I unplugged my computer and restarted it. My background was changed to some binary.

I went to a translator and my heart stopped at the results.

""We are nowhere. Standing outside, near the charred power line. Beside ourselves in the pine. It's over for you, Derek. Become one of us.""

I heard something outside. The power went out. The last thing I remember was a tall, pale thing standing over me.

1329532575.0,84,self.creepypasta,purbk,Room in the attic,SkullyKitt,100,16,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/purbk/room_in_the_attic/,"My friend Sarah told me this story, which she claims happened when she was about 8 or 9 years old. 

Her family had just moved into a new house, which had a door with stairs leading up to the attic rather than a pull-down or a ladder. Much to the excitement of her and her brother (we'll call him Mark), the attic was split into two halves: the front half, which was storage, and a back half which was walled off but had a door going into it. 
The back half was fully lit, carpeted, etc. It was a finished room, but completely devoid of furniture or decoration. She and Mark wanted to turn it into a playroom, but their parents were afraid that if she or Mark got hurt or something, they wouldn't be able to hear it and respond quickly. There was no lock, so instead they put an old mattress from the front half of the attic upfront in front of the door, then pushed some boxes in front of it to make it harder to move. 


That summer, while watching TV, Sarah heard Mark calling frantically from the attic. Their parents were in the back, working on the garden, and she panicked. Finding the attic door open, she ran upstairs, and saw that Mark had pushed aside the boxes, and shifted the mattress. He stood in the doorway, laughing at her for looking scared, and told her to come see. She got frightened - not of Mark, but of getting in trouble if their parents came in and caught them up in the attic. 


Her first response was to tell on him before she got in trouble herself, so she ran outside to tell her mom and dad. Much to her surprise, Mark was already out there with them. He was helping them with the garden - and apparently had been, for several hours. 


They were only in that house for another three years, but  during that time she refused to go into the attic for any reason.

It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage. After what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing. Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached, and found the door ajar. Nobody was inside. The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning.
As he looked around the inside of the cabin, he was surprised to see the walls adorned by several portraits, all painted in incredible detail. Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred and malice. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.

The next morning, the hunter awoke — he turned, blinking in unexpected sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1eluew,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1eluew/the_portraits/,

I lived, once, in a city called New York. My mother is Terrie Erics. She’s in the phone book. If you know the city, and you read this, find her. Don’t show her this, but tell her I love her, and that I’m trying to come home. Please.
It all started when I decided, around the time that I turned twenty-five, that it was time for me to give up taking my backpack in to work. It would make me look more mature, I thought, if I weren’t lugging around a book bag everywhere like a high school student. Of course this meant that I had to give up reading in the subway in the mornings and afternoons, since I couldn’t quite fit my paperbacks into a pocket. A briefcase would have been out of line, since I was working in a factory, and messenger bags always seemed a little, I don’t know, fruity to me. Too purse-like for my liking.
I had an mp3 player, which helped pass the time for a while, but when it broke – it would shut down at the end of every song if I didn’t skip to the next track manually – I gave that up too. So every morning, I’d sit in the metro for a half-hour that dragged on endlessly, with nothing at all to do but watch my fellow passengers. I was slightly shy, so I didn’t like to be caught at it, so I’d surreptitiously watch people. Interestingly enough, I quickly discovered that I wasn’t the only person in the world who was uncomfortable in public. People covered it up in various ways, but I learned to see through them. I divided them up into categories in my head. There were the fidgeters, who couldn’t get comfortable, constantly moving their hands, shifting their weight, moving their legs closer to the bench, then further. They were the most noticeably nervous types. After them were the fake-sleepers, who’d take their seat and practically close their eyes in the same second. Most of them weren’t really sleeping, though. The real sleepers shifted more, came awake suddenly at stops or after loud noises. The fakes just zoned from the second they sat until the moment the train pulled into their stop. Then there were the mp3 player addicts, the occasional laptop people, the people who traveled in groups and talked too loudly. The cellphone junkies were either very popular or just completely unable to shut up for more than two minutes at a time.
Just as people-watching was threatening to get unbearably boring, I found my first incongruity. A middle-aged looking man, brown-haired, average size and weight, and dressed casually. Oddly enough, he seemed almost too normal. He had no remarkable features, no mannerisms, as if he were designed to fade into a crowd. It was that which led me to notice him – I was intentionally trying to see how people acted on the subway, and he didn’t act at all. Didn’t even react, either. It was like seeing someone sitting in front of the television, watching a documentary about fish. They aren’t excited, aren’t engaged, but they aren’t looking away either. Present, but not accounted for.
He was on the subway in the afternoons. It was more than a month into the people-watching experiment before he caught my eye, because I didn’t catch the same subway everyday, and didn’t consciously sit in the same car when I did. I saw him for the first time on a Monday, I believe, and for the second time on the Thursday of the same week. He obviously did catch the same train, and sat in the same car – in the same seat, even. OCD much? I thought at the time. Since he’d caught my attention so much the first time, I watched him more avidly the next. He was, frankly, downright unsettling. He didn’t do anything at all. He sat there, expressionless, head straight, no matter what happened. A woman with a wailing child entered the car and sat right behind him, and still nothing. He didn’t so much as turn his head or frown in annoyance. And that kid was fucking loud, too.
By the time the subway reached my stop, I found myself queasy, and when I exited the car my hands were shaking like I was having a nicotine fit. Something about that man was *wrong*. He was, I thought, some kind of freak. A sociopath, maybe, one of those quiet guys who it turns out has a dozen women’s heads in his freezer, the first victim his mother.

During the summer of 2003, events in the northeastern United States involving a strange, humanlike creature sparked brief local media interest before an apparent blackout was enacted. Little or no information was left intact, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed.
Primarily focused in rural New York state, self proclaimed witnesses told stories of thier enounters with a creature of unkown origin. Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort, to an almost childlike sense of playfulness and curiosity. While their published versions are no longer on record, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year.
In early 2006, the collaboration had accumulated nearly two dozen documents dating between the 12th century and present day, spanning 4 continents. In almost all cases, the stories were identical. I’ve been in contact with a member of this group and was able to get some exceprts from their upcoming book.
The Rake

A Suicide Note: 1964

As I prepare to take my life, I feel it necessary to assuage any guilt or pain I have introduced through this act. It is not the fault of anyone other than him. For once I awoke and felt his presence. And once I awoke and saw his form. Once again I awoke and heard his voice, and looked into his eyes. I cannot sleep without fear of what I might next awake to experience. I cannot ever wake. Goodbye.
Found in the same wooden box were two empty envelopes addressed to William and Rose, and one loose personal letter with no envelope.
‘Dearest Linnie,
I have prayed for you. He spoke your name.’
A Journal Entry (translated from Spanish): 1880

I have experience the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I see his eyes when I close mine. They are hollow. Black. They saw me and pierced me. His wet hand. I will not sleep. His voice (unintelligible text).
A Mariner’s Log: 1691

He came to me in my sleep. From the foot of my bed I felt a sensation. He took everything. We must return to England. We shall not return here again at the request of the Rake.

From a Witness: 2006

Three years ago, I had just returned from a trip from Niagara Falls with my family for the 4th of July. We were all very exhausted after a long day of driving, so my husband and I put the kids right to bed and called it a night.
At about 4am, I woke up thinking my husband had gotten up to use the restroom. I used the moment to steal back the sheets, only to wake him in the process. I appologized and told him I though he got out of bed. When he turned to face me, he gasped and pulled his feet up from the end of the bed so quickly his knee almost knocked me out of the bed. He then grabbed me and said nothing.
After adjusting to the dark for a half second, I was able to see what caused the strange reaction. At the foot of the bed, sitting and facing away from us, there was what appeared to be a naked man, or a large hairless dog of some sort. It’s body position was disturbing and unnatural, as if it had been hit by a car or something. For some reason, I was not instantly frightened by it, but more concerned as to its condition. At this point I was somewhat under the assumption that we were supposed to help him.
My husband was peering over his arm and knee, tucked into the fetal position, occasionally glancing at me before returning to the creature.
In a flurry of motion, the creature scrambled around the side of the bed, and then crawled quickly in a flailing sort of motion right along the bed until it was less than a foot from my husband’s face. The creature was completely silent for about 30 seconds (or probably closer to 5, it just seemed like a while) just looking at my husband. The creature then placed its hand on his knee and ran into the hallway, leading to the kids’ rooms.
I screamed and ran for the lightswitch, planning to stop him before he hurt my children. When I got to the hallway, the light from the bedroom was enough to see it crouching and hunched over about 20 feet away. He turned around and looked directly at me, covered in blood. I flipped the switch on the wall and saw my daughter Clara.
The creature ran down the stairs while my husband and I rushed to help our daughter. She was very badly injured and spoke only once more in her short life. She said “he is the Rake”.
My husband drove his car into a lake that night, while rushing our daughter to the hospital. He did not survive.
Being a small town, news got around pretty quickly. The police were helpful at first, and the local newspaper took a lot of interest as well. However, the story was never published and the local television news never followed up either.
For several months, my son Justin and I stayed in a hotel near my parent’s house. After we decided to return home, I began looking for answers myself. I eventually located a man in the next town over who had a similar story. We got in contact and began talking about our experiences. He knew of two other people in New York who had seen the creature we now referred to as the Rake.
It took the four of us about two solid years of hunting on the internet and writing letters to come up with a small collection of what we believe to be accounts of the Rake. None of them gave any details, history or follow up. One journal had an entry involving the creature in its first 3 pages, and never mentioned it again. A ship’s log explained nothing of the encounter, saying only that they were told to leave by the Rake. That was the last entry in the log.
There were, however, many instances where the creature’s visit was one of a series of visits with the same person. Multiple people also mentioned being spoken to, my daughter included. This led us to wonder if the Rake had visited any of us before our last encounter.
I set up a digital recorder near my bed and left it running all night, every night, for two weeks. I would tediously scan through the sounds of me rolling around in my bed each day when I woke up. By the end of the second week, I was quite used to the occasional sound of sleep while blurring through the recording at 8 times the normal speed. (This still took almost an hour every day)
On the first day of the third week, I thought I heard something different. What I found was a shrill voice. It was the Rake. I can’t listen to it long enough to even begin to transcribe it. I haven’t let anyone listen to it yet. All I know is that I’ve heard it before, and I now believe that it spoke when it was sitting in front of my husband. I don’t remember hearing anything at the time, but for some reason, the voice on the recorder immediately brings me back to that moment.
The thoughts that must have gone through my daughter’s head make me very upset.
I have not seen the Rake since he ruined my life, but I know that he has been in my room while I slept. I know and fear that one night I’ll wake up to see him staring at me.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_vmcoa,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vmcoa/the_rake/,

1374767363.0,77,self.creepypasta,1j17li,(True Story) This weekend in the woods,whiskerbiscuit2,97,20,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j17li/true_story_this_weekend_in_the_woods/,"This happened to me this weekend. I've been scouring the Internet ever since and figured you guys would like to know.

So Saturday night, we're drinking and watching that Bear Grylls show on TV with some friends, and we basically got into a bit of a pissing contest as to which of us could survive the best out in the wilderness. So we decide that we're gonna go out to the woods and see who can make their way back to the house first.

There were five of us, so my girlfriend somewhat reluctantly drove us out to the woods just outside of the village and dropped us off. One guy had bought a knife, I was carrying a bottle of whiskey and that was about all we had. Two of the guys had even decided to remove their shoes to make it more challenging, something I elected not to do because I was drunk but not THAT drunk.

We left the car and walked out into the woods together for a few minutes, then we all turned in different directions and carried on walking. The game was that the first to find their way back to the village would win. Now, we all knew these woods pretty well, but in the dark, and with the zigzag route we all took together we were all pretty lost even before we went our separate ways.

My original plan was to use the stars to find my way back out, but that was quickly out of the window because the canopy was too thick to see the sky. I could hear my friends scrunching about and calling out to each other to my left, so I veered towards the right and hoped to find a clearing so I could find the stars.

After a few hundred metres stumbling blindly through the bushes I realised that this wasn't a great idea. The darkness was suffocating, an I literally couldn't see further than a few feet ahea of me. I was constantly banging my toes on rocks and scratching my legs on low branches, and I knew my shoeless friends would be having a much harder time. I couldn't hear them anymore, and I started to feel more than a little uneasy alone in the dark. It was at this point that I remarked that the usual sticky sweet smell of the forest was becoming thick and bitter.

I pulled out a cigarette, and as the lighter flicked on in the darkness I caught the silohuette of something ahead of me in the trees. I was already on edge and my mind was racing, so I squatted down and listened carefully. I couldn't hear anything. I clicked the lighter again and held it out, and there was nothing. I told myself it was my imagination but my heart was thumping, and even in the shallow yellow glow of the lighter flame I was sure the tree line had changed. There had been a big, thick shape ahead of me, and now all I could see was the twisted straggly branches of the trees.

I must have stayed in that spot, squatted down in the undergrowth for a few minutes, scrutinising each tiny bristle and snapping twig I heard around me. I wanted to hear one my friends come crashing through the trees, but that didn't happen ad eventually I realised I needed to move.

I grabbed a branch, took off one of my socks, soaked it in the whiskey and made a makeshift torch (another strategy I had pre planned before leaving). Evaluating my surroundings, I saw that there was a large cliff face to my left, cutting me off from the route back to my friends, ad forcing me to continue right. The torch was dripping flaming chunks of sock everywhere, so I hurried onwards, pushing my way through the bushes and trees. Again I noticed the nasty rotting smell, thicker now even over the smell of burning sock. Finally I heard the trickling of a little stream and the trees opened out a bit.

Sitting in the middle of this little clearing was one of my friends. I couldn't see him very well at first, but I heard him breathing, through his mouth, thick and frothy like he'd been running. I called out his name but he didn't respond. I was already a little shaken but now i was full on freaked out. I crept up to him, scanning the trees, askin if he was ok. I put my hand on his shoulder and two things happened. Firstly his head rolled backwards, like e couldn't hold his own weight, and in the torch light I could see his eyes had rolled back into his head. Secondly, when my hand touched his naked shoulder (he was topless) his skin was sticky. Like he was covered in tree sap or syrup, my hand actually stuck to his skin. I approached the torch and he was totally covered all over in some sort of stringy, sticky goo. His head kept rolling back and forth, his limbs limp and lifeless. I shouted out for help, but we were alone.

Now it didn't occur to me straight away, but it wasn't possible that he could be there, in that clearing. I'd seen him walk off in the opposite direction half an hour earlier, and to reach that clearing he'd have had to either climb up and over that cliff, or pass me as I was crouched in the bushes earlier without me hearing anything.

I had his head in my hands, shouting at him when his eyes eventually rolled forwards and vaguely focused on mine. I asked him what had happened, why he was all sticky etc but got no response. I tried to put his arm over my shoulders and lift him but I swear to god, he weighed about a tonne. I couldn't even move him from his position on the ground. I'm not a big guy, but I've lifted him before on my shoulders and stuff, but this time I could barely budge him. He started letting out a low groan ad I thought I might be hurting him. Also with my head so close to his I could smell his breath, and it was that same bitter, smoggy smell I'd smelt earlier only amplified by a thousand. It made me recoil and gag, and also made me realise that something really fucky was going on.

I'm not proud of this but I left him there. The torch was all but burnt out so I left it next to him and ran into the woods. His groaning was getting louder the further I went away from him, until, when I was just out of his field of view I heard him moving, and the groans turned into a sort of scream, like he was angry or hurt or something. I could hear him crashing through the forest behind me and I just sprinted hard. I could hear his throaty guttural cries getting louder, and when I chanced a glance over my shoulder I could see trees getting pushed aside and branches flying left and right. 

Suddenly I tripped over a fallen log and hit my head hard. I was on the road, the little dirt track that went past an old farm an into the village, the same dirt track my gf had driven us up about an hour before. I didn't hesitate and just ran as fast as I could down that little road. About halfway down I ran into two of my friends, sweating and shaking and jabbering about noises and shapes in the dark. One of them was the friend who, just a few minutes earlier had been chasing me through the woods, gurgling nonsense and covered in god knows what. Here he was, scared but calm and normal, wearing his shirt and shows like he had been before we left. I kept an eye on him as he talked but he seemed normal, nothing at all like the thing I'd encountered earlier. 

We waited for a few more minutes and the two shoeless guys arrived, bleeding and exhausted as I'd expected. Instead of scared they were extremely pissed off at my other friend for his ""stupid jokes"" trying to scare them, following them through the woods making weird noises.

Anyway we headed home and discussed these things but I never told my friend I'd seen ""him"" naked and screaming, trying to attack me. We'd all heard noises, seen and smelt things, but I think most of them think it was the others playing a joke. I don't. There's something in those woods.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1j17li,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j17li/true_story_this_weekend_in_the_woods/,

Smiling at the cheers that were filling the silent room, he flicked his wrist out to his side allowing a black and white wand to slip from his sleeve. Catching it in his hand, he pointed it out to the crowd and laughed a theatrical laugh.

“For my next trick,” He flamboyantly gestured offstage, “I will need my assistant’s assistance.” He smiled at his word humor.

He walked to the side of the stage and pulled onstage a large box on wheels. Decorated with gold, this box stood about half as tall as him. He lifted the lid and looked inside, his face filled with mock surprise.

“Oh dear,” He gripped the box and tilted it so that the audience could see inside. Within the box lay a naked woman, her body relaxed and sleeping. Gravity pulled a strand of brown hair away from her face to reveal a large bruise across her forehead. “It appears as though my assistant has decided to take a nap within this box.”

He tilted the box back upright. “No matter, I was going to have her get in there anyway so shall we continue?”

The sound of the audience’s laughter and screams to continue to make no echoes yet filled his ears till a smile graced his face. “Over here I have some rather sharp swords.” He turned the box so that some swords attached to the back were revealed. The crowd went wild when the swords were shown. He made a note of a family in the back, the father sitting next to a pregnant wife while their children sat in the chairs just in front of them. It seemed that the empty screams were the loudest from them. They had been to almost every one of his shows; his most devoted fans.

He lifted one of the swords from where it rested and used his other hand to close the lid. He smiled at the audience as he stabbed the sword in the side of the box, “The sharpness of these blades is something to be marveled at.” 

He shoved another blade into the box at a different angle, “At one time kings used these blades for battle against dragons and other creatures.”

A dark puddle was spreading across the stage from the bottom of the box as he shoved another blade in to the hilt. “They came into my possession while I was traveling in India.”

With each thrust of a blade the crowd’s gasps lifted his heart. The final blade met its target straight down. “Well, it seems that we have taught my assistant a lesson. Thank you all for being here for this momentous occasion.”

His eyes flowed over the unmoving crowd and then back to the box. This one would make a nice member of the audience. He would probably use her to replace one of the children whose smell was becoming unbearable.

One day, when I was waiting for the train, I noticed a homeless man standing in a corner of the subway station, muttering to himself as people passed by. He was holding out a cup and seemed to be begging for spare change.

A fat woman passed by the homeless man and I distinctly heard him say, “Pig.” 

Wow, I thought to myself. This homeless man is insulting people and he still expects them to give him money?

Then a tall businessman went by and the homeless guy muttered, “Human.”

Human? I can’t argue with that. Obviously, he was human.

The next day, I arrived early at the subway station and had some time to kill, so I decided to stand close to the homeless man and listen to his strange mutterings.

A thin, haggard-looking man passed in front of him and I heard the homeless guy mutter, “Cow.”

Cow? I thought. The man was much too skinny to be a cow. He looked more like a turkey or a chicken to me.

A minute or so later, a fat man went by and the homeless man said, “Potato.”

Potato? I was under the impression that he called all fat people “Pig”.

That day, at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about the homeless man and his puzzling behavior. I kept trying to find some logic or pattern in what he was muttering.

Perhaps he has some kind of psychic ability, I thought. Maybe he knows what these people were in a previous life. In Japan, many people believe in reincarnation.

I observed the homeless man many times and began to think my theory was right. I often heard him calling people things like “Rabbit” or “Onion” or “Sheep” or “Tomato”.

One day, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask him what was going on.

As I walked up to him, he looked at me and said “Bread.”

I tossed some money into his cup and asked him if he had some kind of psychic ability.

The homeless man smiled and said, “Yes, indeed. I do have a psychic ability. It is an ability I obtained years ago. But it is not what you might expect. I can’t tell the future or read minds or anything like that.”

“Then what is your ability,” I asked eagerly.

“The ability is merely to know the last thing somebody ate,” he said.

I laughed because I realized he was right. He said “Bread”. The last thing I had eaten for breakfast that day was toast. I walked away shaking my head. Of all the psychic abilities someone could have, that one must be the most useless.

""Bye Tyler! Love you!"" 

   She of course was yelling down to my downstairs living room where i sat comfortably watching tv. 
""Bye mom, love ya too!"" i replied.

   My mom is a supervisor at a casino and typically works late hours and since it's just me and my mom I just stay home by myself. It has been like this ever since I was about 12 years old. 

   Once she finally left i went upstairs and decided to make myself a late night snack. I couldn't decide what sounded better, a piece of cheesecake or some chocolate ice cream. I decided on the ice cream. Once I started eating, my miniature schnauzer, Ruby, laid near my feet as I began to watch some tv in the upstairs living room. I was watching one of the newer episodes of ""The Walking Dead"", one of my favorite shows.
 
   Rick was about ready to lay into a zombie when the lights and television began to flicker. It seemed weird that this would happen considering that there wasn't a storm outside or any high winds. The tv turned itself off and the lights continued their slow rhythmic flicker. Ruby started to bark and this was pretty common whenever our lights would go out; I think she's afraid of the dark. So I decided to go check on the circuit breaker outside and see if anything happened to it.

   i threw on my boots and coat and walked out into the December snow. I wasn't able to notice from inside but the wind had really picked up since earlier in the day. The branches on the trees wiped back and forth through the harsh wind.

   I found the circuit breaker only to find the hatch to it was open. It didn't seem like anything had happened to the wiring. But then I peered inside and looked more closely. I noticed little teeth marks on the wires.
   Something was trying to bite through the wiring.

   I started to laugh and think i was getting worried over a little mouse or something stupid like that. Then my heart dropped.

   The only way to get to the wiring was unlocking the hatch to the circuit breaker. Something HAD tried to bite through the wiring, but it wasn't a mouse.

   I walked back around to the front door of my house and went back inside. Ruby was waiting anxiously next to the door for my arrival. I patted her on the head and returned to the couch to watch some more tv.

   An hour or so passed by i finally had noticed that Ruby still sat next to the front door. i figured she wanted to go outside so after it went to a commercial i paused it and put on her leash to go outside. I opened the front door and ruby began to growl immediately. I was about to open the screen door when i looked down to see a pool of blood on my front porch. At the end of the trail of blood was a dead rabbit, gutted out and left to die in front of my house. My heart leapt and i shut the door and immediately locked it. 

   ""What the fuck!"" I yelled. 

   I thought what had happened at first was just a coincidence. Now I was starting to get worried. Ruby continued to growl at the door, refusing to leave. I was petting her and trying to calm her down until a loud bang came from my back yard.

   At this point, I didn't want to take my chances and go outside to see what was going on. So i walked to the back of my house near the kitchen and turned on the back patio lights. They lit up for a second and then turned off. Even before tonight the back patio lighting was pretty faulty and needed repair. I didn't want to go outside to see what had happened, but my curiosity was getting the better of me. Also, I didn't want to feel like such a pussy. So once again i decided to venture out into the snow. This time i prepared by bringing a flashlight and a kitchen knife. It wasn't much but it was all I had. 

   cautiously, I opened the front door, forced to stare at and walk over the remains of the dead rabbit graciously left as an early Christmas present. Before I walked around back I shined my light into my front yard.
   Hoove prints.

   I felt a little bit relieved. A deer, a stupid fucking deer. That could explain the dead animal on my porch but was it possible for a deer to open a circuit breaker? 

   I made my way around back. I shined the light on the hoove tracks, following them up to my backyard patio furniture. I shined the light up at the furniture to see that everything seemed fine. Although one of the chairs was missing. I shined my flashlight closer to the house and to my horror i saw blood draped across the side of my house, the missing chair flung next to the back door with slashes through the chair cushion. 

   Whatever had killed that rabbit must have smeared it along the back of my house before laying it out front. This couldn't have been the work of a deer. I was back to panic mode.

   ""Fuck. This."" I thought to myself.

   I ran, yes ran back to the front of the house nearly tripping up in the snow. I was done with this detective shit for the night. I got back to the front porch and noticed immediately that the dead rabbit was gone. Nothing left but the pool of blood starting to freeze over. 

   My heart started beating hard. I had left the front door unlocked.I looked closely at the door and noticed it wasn't completely closed, it was cracked.

   I reached for my pocket and remembered i had left my keys sitting on the downstairs coffee table.
   ""Shit."" i muttered. 

   I sat there long and hard, trying desperately to remember if i had actually closed the door when i left the house the second time. What if some..thing... had gotten into my house? Maybe it wasn't a deer after all. too many thoughts were running wild in my head. 

   Then again, I could be overreacting, What if it truly was a deer that did all this? Maybe it had rabies and was just having a freak out? I'm no animal expert but it made me feel a little more at ease.

   After a few minutes of standing and staring at the front door I walked inside. Nothing seemed out of place, all seemed right. All seemed right until I realized Ruby didn't come up and greet me at the door like she usually did. Paranoia struck my heart like a hammer once more. A lump developed in my throat as I tried to work up the courage to call out my dog's name.

   ""Ru..Ruby?"" I choked.

   No sound. No sound except the howling wind creeping outside my home.
   ""Ruby!"" I yelled, gaining more courage this time.

   This time I heard a slight thud come from the basement respond to the sound of my voice.

   I walked over to the stairway down to my basement. I could see the door was wide open, almost inviting me to come down to see what lurked below me. I really had to think about this. Who knows what was down there. I didn't want to go but I had no choice, curiosity once again gave me the gentle push I needed to explore once again.

   I grabbed the kitchen knife I had from before and slowly descended down the stairs. Each step creaking louder than the last. 

   ""Ruby?"" I called out. No sound this time.

   I got to the bottom of the stairs and turned the corner. The middle area of our uncompleted basement looked normal. Nothing seemed touched or moved. I took slow strides looking in every corner of the room nearing my destination. My bedroom.

   I began to breath heavy when I noticed my bedroom light was on. I never kept my light on if I left the room. Something or someone was in that room. I stepped closer to the room, gripping the knife tighter with a sweaty palm. Finally I stood directly in front of the lit room. I took a deep breath and flung the door open.
   I dropped the knife.

   There, sprawled out on my bed, was my dog's body. Blood sprayed everywhere. Her innards hung around my room like Christmas decorations. Ruby's decapitated head sat on my dresser facing towards the door. Her eyelids had been ripped off and I could see the terror that was still left in her eyes.

    ""Oh my god..Ruby!"" I cried. I couldn't believe my eyes. Now I knew that after all my denial, there was no possibility of any sort of animal doing this.

   After a good minute of weeping, I looked up again to see another horror. Something I hadn't even noticed when I first walked in. There, written in my dog's blood, was a message written on the wall: I'M ALWAYS AROUND YOU. WATCHING. WAITING.

   Next to the message, the basement window right above my bed was busted in. Whoever did this, had escaped.
   I had no idea what to do. I was in shock and awe from what had just occurred. I needed to get help. I didn't want to call the police because they would have thought I was a lunatic to say some person came into my home and killed my dog. 

   Paul. I needed to get to Paul.

   Paul is our next door neighbor who has pretty much watched me grow up my entire life. He fought in the Gulf War and if anybody could help me, it would be a veteran.

   I ran upstairs and out the front door, nearly slipping in the blood of the rabbit. I flew to Paul's door and began knocking frantically, pounding on it unsure if whoever had killed my dog was still wandering around.

   No answer. 

   His White Ford F-150 was still in the driveway so I know he had to be home. 

   I ran around to his backyard and went to the backdoor. He usually kept it open and to my luck it was unlocked. 

   ""Paul? Are you home man?"" I heard some shuffles in the back near his bedroom.

   ""Hey some really crazy stuff has happened to me tonight and I could really use your...""

   I couldn't finish my sentence because when i went back to Paul's room, at the foot of his bed was Paul's dead body being consumed by a giant black figure. It had red beatty eyes and horns where it's ears should be. It had long pinchers near its mouth and sharp pointy fangs off the end of it's mouth, and it had four, what i presumed to be man legs.

   It looked up from it's feast to reveal a devilish grin. I was frozen with fear. It continued to gorge on Paul's flesh as he grinned and glared into my eyes. I was unsure if I would be able to move or not. My knees had locked and if I attempted to run my legs would just give in. It was that stare, the look in his eyes that he has already caught his prey without even catching it yet.

   Finally after a couple minutes of frozen terror he stopped consuming Paul long enough to say one word in a long and unfamilar hiss

   ""Run."" 

   All at once my legs had regained their strength and I was out of there like a bat out of hell. I darted out the front door and could hear the monster chasing me bumping into Paul's furniture as it sprinted towards my fleeing feet. I ran back inside my home and locked the door. I could hear him pounding on the door, harder and harder he hit it. Attempting with all his might to break it down. But then all at once the pounding stopped. I was cautious now more than ever. This thing was determined to kill me. Then it hit me all at once.

   The window.

   My bedroom window was wide open and that thing is probably already in the house. I decided one more time that leaving was my best option. So i picked up the knife and ran down the street towards my other neighbors. I ran up to the Wilkerson's house and rang the doorbell no reply, but the lights were on. I busted in the door and ran into their kitchen to find both of their bodies mutilated all over their kitchen table. words were written on the tile floor: WATCHING. WAITING.

   At this sight my heart sank. He killed them all. He probably got the rest of the neighbors too. I must be the last one alive.

   Well if this was true I wasn't going to give up. Not that easily. I looked around the Wilkerson's home for a gun. I wasn't able to find any kind of suitable weapon until I walked down to the basement. There found an old hunting rifle Mr. Wilkerson had hanging up on a mantle. Ammunition was right next to it. 

   I loaded the old gun up and headed upstairs slowly. Their stairs were much older and creaked louder than ours. I was mid-way up the stairs when a voice appeared upstairs.

   ""This is the Saint Peters Police Department, is there anybody else here?""

   Excitement leapt into my heart. Somebody had alerted the police, thank god. I ran up the stairs to be greeted by two officers

   ""Officers! I'm here! I'm right here!""

   The moment i walked upstairs I knew it was too late. Right behind the two officers was the monster. It looked and me and gave me the familiar blood-stained smile it had previously shown me and before I could even warn the officers, the pinchers grabbed ahold of their throats and sliced them clean open. 

   ""NO!"" I screamed.

   I took aim, I wasn't a great shot but I've been hunting once or twice. I opened fire. The first bullet flew past it's head. The second bullet hit it right in it's left pincher. It hollered in pain. It began to run at me at full force. I shot again, this time hitting one of the four legs. Then I hit it square in the head stopping it dead in it's tracks. It fell to the ground in front of me. It gasped for air and looked at me with it's red beatty eyes once more. 

   ""Fuck you."" I said as i put the final bullet through its brain.

   I threw the gun down and walked back to my house. It was over and I was tired after a long night of torment.
   The howling of the wind had finally died down and it was time to sleep. When I reached my house I saw that the blood of the rabbit had finally frozen over. I stepped over it and walked into my home.

   As I walked into the living room I saw with all my horror Paul's carcass laying on the couch. That same terrible message was written across the top part of my living room once more for my eyes to endure: I'M ALWAYS AROUND YOU. WATCHING.WAITING. At the moment I saw the message I felt something grab tightly around my neck and squeeze. Everything faded to black.

   I awoke to everything cleaned in the living room. Not a trace of blood or guts anywhere. I was thoroughly impressed with the creature's precision to detail. Making it look as if nothing had happened. There in the living room with me sitting on the couch was Paul, decorated in his Class A uniform enjoying a cup of coffee. Ruby laid at his feet and I was in the kitchen enjoying a bowl of ice cream. Dying wasn't so bad. Not at all. I barely felt it. My only regret is that I wish I could warn my mom before she gets home about the creature. About how he's lurking in the depths of her closet. About the surprising death slowly coming for her. About how he is always watching. Waiting.

You've got talent, they say.  I suppose I do, which is why I’m writing this creepypasta in the first place.  It’s based on a true event that happened to me, years ago.  It’s finally time to share my tale.*

   *I’m a 27 year old woman now, but I still remember the events of one night of my childhood with vivid detail.  What I’m about to tell you about… the experience was life changing.   Too much happened to forget it, even if it was eleven years ago.  I was 16 at the time.  I had just turned 16, to be exact.  It was my birthday party.*

   *That night, a simple game of jail break turned into a fight for my life.  Jail break is a kid’s game similar to hide and seek.  People hide, and people seek.  If you’re found and tagged, you’re taken to “jail.”  The other people hiding can then tag the “jail” and yell “Jail break!” to free you.  The round continues until everyone is imprisoned.  Now, I know what you’re thinking.  Child's games at a 16 year old's birthday party?  Yeah, well, this was the midnight edition of the game on a large expanse of farm land spotted with patches of forest.  Things could get pretty intense.  But anyway, the night began like any normal party would.  Guests arrived, (7 of my closest friends, I never have been one to like big parties), cake was eaten, presents were opened.  Then night came.*  
  
 *There were 14 of us total, as my older 19 year old brother had invited some friends over for the game as well, resulting in 6 girls and 8 guys.   We split ourselves into three main teams, two groups consisting of 5 teens, the other of 4.  We then waited until midnight, just clowning around by a bonfire my father had started for us.  The fire would serve as the “meeting” location between each round of jail break.  It was a fun night, expected to be made better by the upcoming game.*

   *Finally, my brother announced it was midnight.  The “leader” of each of the three groups played rock paper scissors to see whose team would be “it” first.  My team, a group of five, was hiding for the first round.  The group of four was seeking, led by my brother.  We began the game at 10 past midnight, with directions to meet back at the fire at 1:10AM, if his group couldn't capture everyone.*

   *Immediately, I led my group away from the fire, and told them the quick plan I had come up with.  I knew my own land the best, so I’d go solo.  I advised the other four to split into groups of two to hide.  I knew I was fast, so if anyone got captured, I’d be able to sneak in and free them.  I recommended some spots for the four to hide, gave them instructions to text me if they got caught, and left them to find my own hiding place – in the barn.*

   *The barn was about an acre away from where the bonfire was at.  I guess I should clarify, the land was no longer an actual “farm.”  We’d gotten rid of all the animals except a few horses when I was 11.  So, I headed to the unused part of the barn, specifically, the hay loft.  I burrowed myself into a small hole in the stacking of hay bales, pulled another bale on top of the hole to cover it, and settled down as comfortably as I could in the tight, cramped space.  If you’ve ever played in a barn before, you know what I’m talking about, being in one of the little cubby holes!  I knew it would be impossible to find me, as the arrangement of the hay bales was only somewhat neat.  No one would know my exact location, unless they searched behind and under every loose hay bale.  It was there that I waited out the round.*
  
   *To save you the boredom of reading about the nothingness that happened as I waited, I’ll skip to 12:45AM.  I was cramping up by then, and when I took a quick glance at my phone, I knew it was getting close to the end of the round.  I had only received two text messages, one stating that someone on my team was caught, but another one a moment later told me to stay put; someone else was heading to the rescue.*
  
   *It was 12:52AM when I finally heard someone else enter the barn.  I figured it was my brother by the stealthy way I heard the door being opened and shut.  I listened quietly as he carefully stepped into the main part of the barn below the hayloft.  There were plenty of hiding places down there that I often occupied, so I figured he’d busy himself looking through those.  As he walked around beneath me, I noticed not only something odd in his footsteps, but another sound accompanying his steps.  He sounded as if he were limping, but the other sound, slightly louder than that made by his feet, was a constant dragging sound.  He was carrying something, but what could he possibly be taking with him as he searched for people?  And why would he drag it?*
  
   *I was listening so intently that I jumped, startled because of a thud that resonated through the barn as my brother began his ascent up the stairs to the loft.  His footsteps sounded even more off as he climbed the stairs, and the thing he dragged behind him scared me.  It sounded heavy, so why would he bother carrying it around…?  The object pounded against each stop as he dragged it up, and I tensed with each step he took.*  
   
   *When he reached the top, all sounds stopped for nearly five minutes.  He must know I’m here, I remember thinking, assuming. He’s trying to scare me.  And boy, it was working!*
 
   *The footsteps resumed, coming closer to me with each limping stride.  The dragging object was muffled by the hay on the floor, but I could still hear it.  Seconds passed, but it felt like hours.  I remember wondering why my brother hasn’t stopped to search anywhere… he was just walking.  But, when he reached my hiding spot, he stopped directly in front of it.*
  
   *I remember thinking I had left an obvious trail by accident; maybe my arrangement of the bales wasn't as concealing as I had thought.  He knew I was there.  He was standing right in front of me, I could hear him breathing.  I noticed his breathing was off too… it was raspy.  I wondered what had happened to my brother to cause him to limp, and to be so… so out of breath.*
   
   *Then, I heard a soft chuckle.  It was that quiet laugh that made me positive the man on the other side of the hay was not my brother.  The laugh was too deep, too old sounding, too humorless.  Too… too evil.*
 
   *Then the chuckling abruptly stopped and the man dropped the thing he was carrying.  I heard it hit the floor, and bounce slightly off the hay.  Hands rustled through the hay, searching for the strings of the bale.  They found their target, and the bale moved.  I expected the dim moonlight to come leaking in through the cracks in the old barn walls, giving everything a soft glow as the bale was thrown aside.  I’d experienced it often enough to know it would happen… but this time… it didn't.  My vision stayed black, still pitch dark.  I was terrified at that point, and unable to move.*
  
   *That was when the soft chuckling began again, coming from near the steps of the hayloft.  I listened to the laughter, and willed myself to sink further into the hay.  Finally, it stopped.  My eyes began to adjust to the dim glow I was used to in the barn.  I remember sitting still, not moving, unable to move, for what must have been a good 10 minutes.  I listened to every tiny sound coming from the barn, waiting for something to shift.*
   
   *I remember then that I had felt the sudden need to leave the barn, to get out, and get out fast.  So that’s what I did.  I forced myself to move from my cramped location and stand up cautiously.  Once I was up, I felt safer.  I could see around me, and I knew I was alone again.  I took a step out of my little cubby hole but quickly recoiled.  It wasn't the soft touch of hay underneath my sneakered foot I felt.  It was something hard.  Looking down, I saw a strange shape, but I wasn't too sure what it was.  I pulled out my phone and illuminated the object.  Gazing down in horror, I scrambled to leave the barn as quickly as-.*






   The girl looked up from her computer screen.  “Hello?”  She said softly into the silence.  She waited a moment as she listened for movement, but heard nothing more.  She thought she had heard a voice somewhere in the house.  She thought maybe her four year old daughter had woken up, or husband was coming to look for her, wondering why she wasn't in bed.  

   Sighing, she glanced back down at the screen.  “Nearly 3AM,” she muttered.  “Enough writing for now,” she told herself as a yawn overcame her.  She saved her work and shut the laptop off.  Standing up, she stretched and headed into the kitchen for a glass of water.

   She turned on the tap and let it run for a few seconds, allowing the water to become it’s coldest as she retrieved a mug from the cupboard.  She fought off a second yawn and put the cup under the flow of water.  She turned off the water, and downed the drink in a few big gulps.  Placing the cup gently in the sink, the young woman turned off the lights and headed towards her and her husband’s room.  She made a quick stop at the bathroom and went into the room.  Without turning on any lights, she stripped down to her undergarments and crawled into bed beside her sleeping husband, who was lying on his side.  Drawing close to him, she was already half asleep when she felt-.

   “Oh my God, what-…!”  She exclaimed.  Her husband’s back was wet, drenched, in water or sweat or something.  She turned away and flipped on the bedside lamp and, rubbing her eyes with one hand and shaking her husband with the other, attempted to wake him up.  But that’s when she saw.  Her husband’s back wasn't soaked in water, it was red.  His nightshirt was stained with….

   “Blood,” she whimpered to herself.  The entire bed had traces of it everywhere.  The woman literally fell out of bed and stumbled towards the phone on the other side of the room.  Picking it up, she dialed 911 as quickly as possible.  Stammering, she spoke into the phone, explaining what she had just found.  She gave her name and address and hung up with shaking hands.

   Then she heard it: a limping gait with an object being dragged behind.  The sound was coming down the hallway, towards her room, and was all too familiar.

   “Oh my God…,” she whispered.  She ran to the door and groped for the handle, trying to lock it.  Moments before the lock could be turned, the door flung open.

   Standing directly in front of her was a man, or a figure of a man.  He was all black, as if bathed in shadow, though light was cast directly on him, and he resembled the shape of a human but he had no distinguishable features.  His breath was raspy and shallow, and in his right hand, he carried the same object the young woman had seen and nearly been killed with on the night of her 16th birthday party.  It was an ax.  The sharp edge was stained red, and the majority of the handle was damp with blood, just like the night of her party, the night her brother had been found dead.  

   She was frozen in place.  The soft chuckling emerged from the man, just like it had eleven years ago.  He raised the ax and - .

1354869318.0,76,self.creepypasta,14fpi7,Unknown friend,ellster67,107,31,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/14fpi7/unknown_friend/,"This all started when I got a friend invitation from someone on Facebook who had the same name as me. They sent me a message saying ""We have the same name! "". I added them and figured what the heck, it might be cool to have someone with the same name as me. I realized soon afterwards that I should never have accepted that friend request.
The next day I woke up to a message reading ""What's up?"". I replied ""Nothing much, just heading to a friend's"". ""Which friend?"" They asked. I thought this was a bit strange seeing as they didn't know me in person, but I decided to humor them. ""My friend Bryan."" I replied. I checked my phone and noticed they had gone offline. I was smiling to myself, I had never actually spoken to anyone with the same name as me before in my life! This could be cool! I was kind of socially awkward and didn't get out much. Let's just say internet friends weren't something new to me. I got to Bryan's house, but he wasn't answering his phone or his buzzer. I had the weirdest feeling I was being watched, but there was no one around. I yelled up to his bedroom window. Still no answer.

At one point his cat hopped up and began cleaning itself on the windowsill. I gave up and went to head home. I got a message from an unknown number reading ""Where's Bryan?"". I made a face and figured it might've been one of my friends who I hadn't had a chance to put into my new blackberry yet messaging me about Bryan's new place. Bryan moved in a week and a half before this happened. ""I don't know, he's not answering his phone."" I replied.

I stopped in the variety store on the way back and bought some cigarettes, unable to shake that weird feeling I was having all day. My cellphone rang suddenly and made me jump. It was my friend Dan, he was wondering if I wanted to stop by to play his new Halo game. I wasn't really in the mood to do much, the weather outside was crappy and I still felt weird. I told him I couldn't make it and he hung up. I looked at my phone and it just said the call was disconnected. I shrugged it off and continued home. I finally made it back from my journey across the city to my nice warm home. Everything from then on was normal, I made dinner for my girlfriend and her son, watched some TV shows, and went to bed. That night I woke up with that weird feeling again, my cellphone was going off somewhere in the house. It was echoing loudly but It wasn't on the bedside where I thought I left it. I looked all over the room and decided to go to bed. Whoever was calling me would have to wait. A few hours passed and my phone was still going off. Eventually I fell asleep.

I woke up the next day with a picture message on my phone. What I saw next was extremely graphic and violent. It looked as if whoever took the picture was in the process of pulling someone's face off. There was a long incision along the right side of the face where the photographer hooked his fingers in and was tearing. It was impossible to tell who the picture was of due to the face that the face was folded in on itself, like a slice of turkey. Then I noticed something familiar about the victim. A pot leaf lip ring dangled from one of the hanging lips. It was Bryan's. I locked up, I looked around and my house was empty. My girlfriend was already at work and her son had left for school. I had the day off so I figured I was just going to sleep in until this happened. I ran to the bathroom and threw up.

I tried calling Bryan a few times but his phone went right to his answering machine which had been changed. It was replaced with complete silence. The fourth time I called I put it on speaker and realized that it wasn't silent. There was a very quiet sound, almost as if someone was swallowing or clearing their throat, followed by a beep. I sat there staring at my phone and went and turned the TV on to check the news. There was nothing on, no any strange deaths or anything. I decided to go back to Bryan's house and wait. Hours passed and no one came in or out of his building, it was starting to get dark so I went home. My girlfriend texted me asking ""Where are you?"". I called her instead of replying and explained I'd be home soon. My cellphone beeped and I told her I had a text message. She said she'd let me go and told me to hurry up and that my dinner was in the fridge. I told her I loved her, we said goodbye to each other and I hung up.

I looked down at my cellphone to read the text. I opened it. ""Where's Dan?"" It said. My heart stopped. I ignored it and kept walking, that strange feeling that I was being watched was beginning to overwhelm me. I ran the last half of the way home. My girlfriend and her kid had already gone to bed long before I got home so I decided to grab some leftover supper. I let out a sigh and headed into the kitchen. Something moved behind me and suddenly everything went black. When I awoke I was on my kitchen floor, the plate in my hand had broken and there was food all over the floor. My cellphone was going nuts but I had no idea where it was coming from. I knew it was mine because the ringtone was the same, but I had checked everywhere! Every now and then the smell of burning hair would slither its way up my nostrils. I was sweating buckets at this point due to the paranoia. I kept thinking I could hear someone swallowing, or lightly clearing their throat. It was so quiet it was hard to hear through the sound of my cellphone going off but I could DEFINITELY hear something. Suddenly my cellphone stopped ringing and with the silence came heavy darkness.

I reached for the lightswitch and something wet brushed my fingertips, i heard that sound again. It sounded like someone swallowing. I could feel my heart beating in my neck. I was scared. My skin crawled as I felt what seemed like a cold breeze. I saw dim light casting shadows of the railing along the stairs which meant one thing. Someone or something had opened the balcony door and was in my house. I knew it was a bad idea, but I was worried about my girlfriend and her son. Nothing would stand between me and their safety. I reached into my pocket for something to defend myself with and found I had my keys and a lighter. I tucked the lighter in one fist and poked the keys through the gaps between my fingers and walked up stairs.

Something creaked from behind me, I turned around and couldn't even see the stairs in my wake. It had gotten so dark that something could've been there and I wouldn't have even seen it. I sat there for awhile, scanning my surroundings frantically before shaking off the anxiety and turning around. Something was standing in the doorway. I froze. I clenched my fists so far one of the keys cut into the webbing between my fingers. My cellphone rang. once. loudly. vibrating. in my pocket. A shiver tore its way through me and I looked down quickly towards my pocket. The combination of fear and confusion hit me so hard it was almost nauseating. My stomach lurched from the jolt of it all and I felt like I was about to be sick. When I looked up the door was closed, the tiny curtains I bought for the window at the top of the door were drawn shut. My ears were ringing, I had never felt anything like this kind of fear in my entire life. It was as if it had manifested itself into a living thing and swallowed me whole, trapping me within its pitch black stomach.

I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths, I needed to be strong. That's when I heard it, my cellphone rang again. I opened my eyes and wildly grabbed for my cellphone. As I looked at my cellphone I realized two things. 

1. The homescreen on my blackberry read ""Battery too low for radio use"" 

2. The lights in my house were back on.

Then my ringtone played loudly from what sounded like right next to my ear. I spun around and was face to face with something I can't quite put into words. My vision faded into a blur, and I fell to my knees in front of the creature. I tried to crawl away but collapsed onto my chest. As the world spun around me, my shaking hand slid the phone up beside my ear. Then it hit me. I suddenly knew what was happening. I'd lost the game. My palms sweaty, knees weak, arms heavy, it's falling out of my pockets already  - mom's spaghetti. Before I blacked out I heard a raspy voice emanate from the speaker - ""I was phone.""

I wouldn't say this is normal or that a lot of people will believe me but at least I'm getting it out there. Life is never ending. Literally never ending. When you die, you start over as a child and grow up. It's not reincarnation, but the same life. I'm actually on my fifth go around and everytime, I'm murdered before my 30th birthday. I think the farthest I've gone is to 29. The last time I lived I was hit by a car. The time before that, stabbed by one of the people I knew well. The confusing thing about this whole ordeal is, you live in the same time period, know the same people, have the same parents and the only things different are what you do with the time you have.
The first time I lived, I went to college. When I died because of a drunk driver, I was born again but knew what had happened. I mean you really don't realize it till youre in your teens but when you get close to the end you just know something is around the corner waiting for you. This is a gift and somewhat of a depressing thing to deal with. Like I said, it sounds far fetched. For all those skeptics, I can remember bits and pieces of what happened in my past life. I remember certain things that have happened to the world only someone with knowledge of the future would know. For one thing, Romney wins, republicans try and fix us but from what I remember, the country gets worse. A major disaster happens in the middle of 2013, it's something that changes the world. Mark my words.
Anyway, as I'm writing this, I can feel death approaching. The pain is always excruciating and it seems that my deaths are always what seems that I remember the most. That stabbing has to have been the worst so far. I've been killed by a car, a drunk driver and have been killed by an explosion. All those happened almost instantly. The stabbing however lasted for what seemed like hours. I can remember the knife going in and out of my flesh as I screamed. Each blow not finishing me off, eventually choking on my own blood as it went into my throat. God, it was so painful. 
As I'm writing this, I just have a feeling that soon I'm going to die. Every life after the first, I've told people my story and I never know if someone believes me. I think because all of these experiences, I'm in at least my early 90's spiritually, if not older. If no one ever believes me, I'll never know. At least I tried getting my story out. It'd just sad to think that death is just a foot step away.

I found this note at an estate sale. This guy was only twenty and pretty loaded. Apparently this guy was killed by his wife, shot to death while he was sleeping. It's creepy to think that he could be telling the truth and he just has heightened awareness of it.

We were at the Edisto First Presbyterian Church, where a girl named Julia Legare was buried in her family mausoleum in 1852. 
  
People reported hearing unearthly screams time and time again, but never investigating the cause of it. Fifteen years later, when they opened the door to the mausoleum to inter the next family member who had died, finding her corpse huddled in the corner next to the door, arms outstretched as if still trying to find the exit.

Well, my friends thought it would be a funny idea to shut the giant stone door (which was originally open) behind me and pick me up in the morning. The bastards left me there… I tried and tried, using all of my strength, but I couldn’t budge it, it had taken four people to put it in place. In the dark, I resigned myself to the night ahead of me.

Now, I normally don’t frighten easily, but sitting there in the relatively small place, surrounded by a looming pressure that I couldn’t begin to explain, the darkness itself seemed to try to consume me. From all around it felt like weight was pressing against my skin, making even breathing hard. I sat in the dark for what must have been hours.

Then I heard the scratches. They were faint at first, I was sure it was my imagination, but soon they became more and more frantic as time passed. I huddled up in one of the corners farthest from the door and tried to cover my ears but nothing could stop the growing cacophony. This all may have lasted for a few minutes, but each second was an unbearable eternity.

Then, a loud scream echoed through the darkness, it was a wail of unrestrained pain and fear. The scratching stopped. For the first time I could distinctly make out the sound of a girl sobbing to herself, the pitiful gasping of one without a shred of hope left.

I felt such sorrow at the moment, such pain, that I think I forgot how to be afraid. In my heart all her suffering seemed to resonate. Inexplicably, I found myself apologizing aloud for everything that had happened to her. Hell, a part of me wanted to reach out and feel for a body to hug, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it for fear that I truly would find one.

I don’t know whether or not she heard me or was even aware of my presence, the sobbing continued and I could again hear fingers against the stone slab that was the tomb door.

I fell asleep at some point, which I felt was a merciful gift from the fates. I’m not sure how long I was out, but I was woken by a loud and powerful thud as the door slammed against the ground outside. I could tell from the light gray outside that daybreak was near, so I must have slept for at least a few hours.

I stumbled outside and went to a small unlocked prayer house. I think previously it was a segregated mini-church, but regardless, I leaned against the door and waited nervously until my ‘friends’ arrived. I approached them as they clustered around the fallen door, two of them were kneeling next to it with faces of shock.

There were bloody streaks covering the interior of the door, some with light scratches from fingernails, many without. I think now that she must have shrieked when they broke away from her hands, but I can’t be sure.

At first, they looked to me, then checked my hands, then nervously glanced at one another. I was rightfully pissed with them and told them every detail of what I remembered, wanting them to know what I had been put through.

Finally, after I grudgingly got into the car and we started to head back, someone spoke up. My friend said to me “We were afraid to say anything, but look at your face.”

I later found out that many times people had tried to permanently seal the entrance to the mausoleum, including enough heavy locks and chains that it would require heavy equipment to remove it, only to have it found torn open with the door lying on the ground once more. This was in the 1980s, the last attempt of many through the decades. It seemed like some force was ensuring that it was impossible to ever repeat the mistakes of the past. This is something I am understandably quite grateful for, but to this very day I am chilled to the bone when I think of what happened that night.

When I reached from the back seat and adjusted the rear-view mirror, I saw that there was blood caked on my face. Just like the streaks upon the stone slab, there were dark red lines on either side, as if someone had gently cradled my face with torn fingers as I slept that night, feeling the warmth of another for the first time in over a hundred years.

Timmy was a young boy who was never noticed by people, he would always be excluded and no one really paid attention to him. His own parents were always busy and never really cared about him, the only person who paid attention to him we're his godparents: Cosmo and Wanda. Timmy always joked about how there names sounded as fairies, this had later a big effect in the story.

Cosmo worked as a comedian but was slowly running out of business, basically because his jokes weren't good enough. But still Cosmo was a great godfather, he taught Timmy how to play pool and Timmy enjoyed it well enough. Timmy's parents started noticing how Timmy enjoyed better the company of his godparents instead of his normal parents and thus prohibited Timmy of seeing them again. When Cosmo was noted about this he had a little chat with Timmy about how he would miss him. Cosmo gave Timmy his favorite pool ball: the black 8.

Timmy was always depressed and crying in his bedroom alongside 2 fishes Wanda bought him. Timmy's parents tried to cheer him up but saw no effect and left him to rot. They hired a young well looking babysitter for him called Vicky, but Timmy would always take her wrong and thought of her as ""malicious"" and ""evil"". And just as everything was going wrong more problems came. Timmy's father received news late at night that: ""Two persons know as Cosmo and Wanda were found dead after a car crash when going out to dinner"".

Timmy's father told the boy the whole story without even showing emotions and thus Timmy was traumatized... He was never the same, his friends felt sorry for him but knew they had to move on. Timmy's best friends (A.J: An intelligent boy who was very good at school) (Chester: A goofy boy that lived almost the same as Timmy in terms of money) left him and went off to make other friends, leaving Timmy alone and even sadder.

Timmy had a weird teacher called Crocker who taught the boys every single lesson. Crocker saw how depressed the boy was and tried cheering him up, after failing he saw how serious this injury was and thinking it couldn't be worse he took the opportunity to abuse of Timmy sexually. Timmy was so lost into his own thoughts he wouldn't even notice that he was being raped, this went on every school day. Vicky never stopped trying to help him but Timmy would always refuse, leaving Vicky with a hard and miserable job.

Timmy was at the edge of suicide when something amazing happened. Timmy was frustrated, he was laying in his bed when he saw the 8 ball in his desk, he noticed something that made him lose control. Vicky had cleaned the ball and took with it his godparents fingerprints, this was when Timmy knew she was mad and evil. He threw the ball towards the wall and it broke in half leaving pink clouds behind. Timmy was surprised by this when suddenly two creatures equally looking to his godparents came out, only this where fairies. He adopted them as his ""Fairy Oddparents"" and was once again happy. Of course everything went completely different in real life. Nothing ever came out of the ball but pieces of black marble, Timmy actually had Psychotic Depression which made him hallucinate about this magical creatures.

He spoke in his bedroom to no one every day. Vicky couldn't come in for somedays and was beginning to worry, after 3 days Timmy came out and what Vicky saw was something impossible and unexpected, he was smiling. Vicky thought this was the end of all this madness, but it all went even worse. Timmy spoke to no one in front of her, Vicky tried to help him multiple times but failed as Timmy shouted and ran to his bedroom.

Timmy imagined multiple things, Crocker was no longer interested in sexual intercourses but rather with catching Timmy's fairies. A.J was seen as a modern Einstein and because Timmy's subconscious wanted to spice it up a little he made Chester poor with a famous baseball player as a father. Timmy's dad was a fairly good business man but because Timmy couldn't understand his job he made the story of him working in a pencil factory as he was always taking notes down with pencil.

Timmy then created a village for fairies from the fact that he knew his godparents had gone to heaven, having other souls or as Timmy referred to as fairies accompanying them.
When Cosmo was sent to the army for 2 years he was put into the troop of sergeant Jorgan Vontangle who was a serious and cold blooded person. Timmy never memorized his name so he knew him as Jorgen Von Strangle, the leader of the fairies.

Timmy was always seen walking and speaking alone and so people ignored him, the only person who wanted and tried to be Timmy's friends was a young nerdy girl called Tootie.
Timmy thought of this girl as ""obsessively in love with him"" when she was only trying to help.
Trixie Tang is a girl who Timmy fell in love with and thus creating the illusion that she was popular and beautiful but always neglecting Timmy.

Still makes me shudder when I think about it.,peace_suffer,84,18,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16nkte/friend_of_mine_found_this_a_while_ago_still_makes/,"Last year I spent six months participating in what I was told was a psychological experiment. I found an ad in my local paper looking for imaginative people looking to make good money, and since it was the only ad that week that I was remotely qualified for, I gave them a call and we arranged an interview.

They told me that all I would have to do is stay in a room, alone, with sensors attached to my head to read my brain activity, and while I was there I would visualize a double of myself. They called it my ""tulpa"".

It seemed easy enough, and I agreed to do it as soon as they told me how much I would be paid. And the next day, I began. They brought me to a simple room and gave me a bed, then attached sensors to my head and hooked them into a little black box on the table beside me. They talked me through the process of visualizing my double again, and explained that if I got bored or restless, instead of moving around, I should visualize my double moving around, or try to interact with him, and so on. The idea was to keep him with me the entire time I was in the room.

I had trouble with it for the first few days. It was more controlled than any sort of daydreaming I'd done before. I'd imagine my double for a few minutes, then grow distracted. But by the fourth day, I could manage to keep him ""present"" for the entire six hours. They told me I was doing very well.

The second week, they gave me a different room, with wall-mounted speakers. They told me they wanted to see if I could still keep the tulpa with me in spite of distracting stimuli. The music was discordant, ugly and unsettling, and it made the process a little more difficult, but I managed nonetheless. The next week they played even more unsettling music, punctuated with shrieks, feedback loops, what sounded like an old school modem dialing up, and guttural voices speaking some foreign language. I just laughed it off - I was a pro by then.

After about a month, I started to get bored. To liven things up, I started interacting with my doppelganger. We'd have conversations, or play rock-paper-scissors, or I'd imagine him juggling, or break-dancing, or whatever caught my fancy. I asked the researchers if my foolishness would adversely affect their study, but they encouraged me.

So we played, and communicated, and that was fun for a while. And then it got a little strange. I was telling him about my first date one day, and he corrected me. I'd said my date was wearing a yellow top, and he told me it was a green one. I thought about it for a second, and realized he was right. It creeped me out, and after my shift that day, I talked to the researchers about it. ""You're using the thought-form to access your subconscious,"" they explained. ""You knew on some level that you were wrong, and you subconsciously corrected yourself.""

What had been creepy was suddenly cool. I was talking to my subconscious! It took some practice, but I found that I could question my tulpa and access all sorts of memories. I could make it quote whole pages of books I'd read once, years before, or things I was taught and immediately forgot in high school. It was awesome.

That was around the time I started ""calling up"" my double outside of the research center. Not often at first, but I was so used to imagining him by now that it almost seemed odd to not see him. So whenever I was bored, I'd visualize my double. Eventually I started doing it almost all the time. It was amusing to take him along like an invisible friend. I imagined him when I was hanging out with friends, or visiting my mom, I even brought him along on a date once. I didn't need to speak aloud to him, so I was able to carry out conversations with him and no one was the wiser.

I know that sounds strange, but it was fun. Not only was he a walking repository of everything I knew and everything I had forgotten, he also seemed more in touch with me than I did at times. He had an uncanny grasp of the minutiae of body language that I didn't even realize I was picking up on. For example, I'd thought the date I brought him along on was going badly, but he pointed out how she was laughing a little too hard at my jokes, and leaning towards me as I spoke, and a bunch of other subtle clues I wasn't consciously picking up on. I listened, and let's just say that that date went very well.

By the time I'd been at the research center for four months, he was with my constantly. The researchers approached me one day after my shift, and asked me if I'd stopped visualizing him. I denied it, and they seemed pleased. I silently asked my double if he knew what prompted that, but he just shrugged it off. So did I.

I withdrew a little from the world at that point. I was having trouble relating to people. It seemed to me that they were so confused and unsure of themselves, while I had a manifestation of myself to confer with. It made socializing awkward. Nobody else seemed aware of the reasons behind their actions, why some things made them mad and others made them laugh. They didn't know what moved them. But I did - or at least, I could ask myself and get an answer.

A friend confronted me one evening. He pounded at the door until I answered it, and came in fuming and swearing up a storm. ""You haven't answered when I called you in fucking weeks, you dick!"" He yelled. ""What's your fucking problem?"".

I was about to apologize to him, and probably would have offered to hit the bars with him that night, but my tulpa grew suddenly furious. ""Hit him,"" it said, and before I knew what I was doing, I had. I heard his nose break. He fell to the floor and came up swinging, and we beat each other up and down my apartment.

I was more furious then than I have ever been, and I was not merciful. I knocked him to the ground and gave him two savage kicks to the ribs, and that was when he fled, hunched over and sobbing. The police were by a few minutes later, but I told them that he had been the instigator, and since he wasn't around to refute me, they let me off with a warning. My tulpa was grinning the entire time. We spent the night crowing about my victory and sneering over how badly I'd beaten my friend.

It wasn't until the next morning, when I was checking out my black eye and cut lip in the mirror, that I remembered what had set me off. My double was the one who'd grown furious, not me. I'd been feeling guilty and a little ashamed, but he'd goaded me into a vicious fight with a concerned friend. He was present, of course, and knew my thoughts. ""You don't need him anymore. You don't need anyone else,"" he told me, and I felt my skin crawl.

I explained all this to the researchers who employed me, but they just laughed it off. ""You can't be scared of something that you're imagining,"" one told me. My double stood beside him, and nodded his head, then smirked at me.

I tried to take their words to heart, but over the next few days I found myself growing more and more anxious around my tulpa, and it seemed that he was changing. He looked taller, and more menacing. His eyes twinkled with mischief, and I saw malice in his constant smile. No job was worth losing my mind over, I decided. If he was out of control, I'd put him down. I was so used to him at that point that visualizing him was an automatic process, so I started trying my damnedest to not visualize him. It took a few days, but it started to work somewhat. I could get rid of him for hours at a time. But every time he came back, he seemed worse. His skin seemed ashen, his teeth more pointed. He hissed and gibbered and threatened and swore. The discordant music I'd been listening to for months seemed to accompany him everywhere. Even when I was at home - I'd relax and slip up, no longer concentrating on not seeing him, and there he'd be, and that howling noise with him.

I was still visiting the research center and spending my six hours there. I needed the money, and I thought they weren't aware that I was now actively not visualizing my tulpa. I was wrong. After my shift one day, about five and a half months in, two impressively men grabbed and restrained me, and someone in a lab coat jabbed a hypodermic needle into me.

I woke up from my stupor back in the room, strapped into the bed, music blaring, with my doppelganger standing over me cackling. He hardly looked human anymore. His features were twisted. His eyes were sunken in their sockets and filmed over like a corpse's. He was much taller than me, but hunched over. His hands were twisted, and the fingernails were like talons. He was, in short, fucking terrifying. I tried to will him away, but I just couldn't seem to concentrate. He giggled, and tapped the IV in my arm. I thrashed in my restraints as best I could, but could hardly move at all.

""They're pumping you full of the good shit, I think. How's the mind? All fuzzy?"" He leaned closer and closer as he spoke. I gagged; his breath smelt like spoiled meat. I tried to focus, but couldn't banish him.

The next few weeks were terrible. Every so often, someone in a doctor's coat would come in and inject me with something, or force-feed me a pill. They kept me dizzy and unfocused, and sometimes left me hallucinating or delusional. My thoughtform was still present, constantly mocking. He interacted with, or perhaps caused, my delusions. I hallucinated that my mother was there, scolding me, and then he cut her throat and her blood showered me. It was so real that I could taste it.

The doctors never spoke to me. I begged at times, screamed, hurled invectives, demanded answers. They never spoke to me. They may have talked to my tulpa, my personal monster. I'm not sure. I was so doped and confused that it may have just been more delusion, but I remember them talking with him. I grew convinced that he was the real one, and I was the thoughtform. He encouraged that line of thought at times, mocked me at others.

Another thing that I pray was a delusion: he could touch me. More than that, he could hurt me. He'd poke and prod at me if he felt I wasn't paying enough attention to him. Once he grabbed my testicles and squeezed until I told him I loved him. Another time, he slashed my forearm with one of his talons. I still have a scar - most days I can convince myself that I injured myself, and just hallucinated that he was responsible. Most days.

Then one day, while he was telling me a story about how he was going to gut everyone I loved, starting with my sister, he paused. A querulous look crossed his face, and reached out and touched my head. Like my mother used to when I was feverish. He stayed still for a long moment, and then smiled. ""All thoughts are creative,"" he told me. Then he walked out the door.

Three hours later, I was given an injection, and passed out. I awoke unrestrained. Shaking, I made my way to the door and found it unlocked. I walked out into the empty hallway, and then ran. I stumbled more than once, but I made it down the stairs and out into the lot behind the building. There, I collapsed, weeping like a child. I knew I had to keep moving, but I couldn't manage it.

I got home eventually - I don't remember how. I locked the door, and shoved a dresser against it, took a long shower, and slept for a day and a half. Nobody came for me in the night, and nobody came the next day, or the one after that. It was over. I'd spent a week locked in that room, but it had felt like a century. I'd withdrawn so much from my life beforehand that nobody had even known I was missing.

The police didn't find anything. The research center was empty when they searched it. The paper trail fell apart. The names I'd given them were aliases. Even the money I'd received was apparently untraceable.

I recovered as much as one can. I don't leave the house much, and I have panic attacks when I do. I cry a lot. I don't sleep much, and my nightmares are terrible. It's over, I tell myself. I survived. I use the concentration those bastards taught me to convince myself. It works, sometimes.

Not today, though. Three days ago, I got a phone call from my mother. There's been a tragedy. My sister's the latest victim in a spree of killings, the police say. The perpetrator mugs his victims, then guts them.

The funeral was this afternoon. It was as lovely a service as a funeral can be, I suppose. I was a little distracted, though. All I could hear was music coming from somewhere distant. Discordant, unsettling stuff, that sounds like feedback, and shrieking, and a modem dialing up. I hear it still - a little louder now.

I know things are bad for you right now, and all you want is for everything to just fade away, but you know that won't happen. That's not how the world works. You were always a crybaby, and I know it's your only real way to cope with things, but you have to stop.

Do you remember when mom and dad asked you what you wanted for your birthday, more than anything in the world, when you were 8? And what did you want? A puppy. Your parents didn't think it was a good idea, so you cried and cried for almost a week. And on your birthday, what was their gift? A bicycle. So you cried and cried, until you heard some little barks, and then you saw her running from the kitchen. She was little, and yellow, and so happy to be around you. What did you call her? That's right! You called her Matilda.

The next couple of months flew by so fast, didn't they? Mom and dad started to argue, but you didn't care. You had Matilda, and that was all that really mattered. But one morning, you woke up, and Matilda wasn't there, was she? So you told your parents, and they immediately went looking for her, asking for you to trust them. And you cried and you cried, until a few days later, they found her in a ditch. And you cried and cried, until well after a week after you buried her. And you never wanted another puppy again.

Do you remember a couple years later, when daddy came to see you after the divorce, that he took you to see his new girlfriend? All the rage you felt, all the loneliness? All the deep feelings of losing something very important to you? Do you remember what you asked your mom what you should do? In her drunken candor, saying that death is the only time that loss counts as keeping someone or something, like Matilda? You spent your time in your room, crying your eyes out again. The next night, you were staying with your father, when his girlfriend tried to make nice, but she talked to your father like you were some kind of freak?

""She won't open up to me"", she said. ""She won't TRUST me, and I wish she would."" And you cried yourself to sleep that night. And the next morning, your father's scream coming from the bathroom, and you ran to him, and all the blood that was all over the bathroom floor? Her body in the tub, alcohol and pills everywhere, her slit wrist limply hanging over the side? The shock must have been too much, because you didn't cry after that. In fact, even at the funeral you didn't cry. You seemed... at ease about it. One could say that you were even happy about her death. To be honest, it was quite a while before you cried again. High school, I believe.

Do you remember him? Johnny Whitmueller. He was such a nice kid. Football player, handsome, hard working, had bought his own car by the age of 16. He was such a catch. You'd say you were the opposite. Shy, so reserved about everything, no friends to speak of. So alone. But out of the blue, he asked you to Prom, and everyone was so shocked. Here he was, the Big Man on Campus, and he wanted to go with some nobody wallflower, instead of the Captain of the Cheerleaders. Word spread quickly. Then the rumors moved faster, didn't they?

Slut. Pity case. Skank. Wannabe welfare queen. Trailer trash. Cat lady. That one was the most preposterous. You don't really LIKE animals, now do you? All these mean, hateful little words, used to kill you from the inside out. You didn't outwardly cry, but everyone could see you wanted to. So they got worse, eventually moving to slapping you, abusing you, holding you down and cutting your hair, forcing you to wear gaudy makeup. And the teachers? They never lifted a finger. They really didn't care, considering most of the kids doing it to you were theirs. So you put up with it.

But Prom is where everything went to Hell for you, didn't it?

You were so pretty. You actually spent time taking care of yourself, and you paid attention to what was fashionable. And your nice, white dress, it looked like a wedding dress. Anyone could see that you would have been the most beautiful bride in the world. And Johnny was so handsome in his suit, perfectly tailored and looking like a model. The red corsage he placed on your white glove was so nice, the perfect splash of color. He really was your Prince Charming, wasn't he?

The event itself wasn't that spectacular, but you didn't care. Johnny was there, and he did everything correct, and he said all the right things. You hadn't even noticed they were getting ready for the coronation of the Prom Queen and King until one of the Cheerleaders reminded everybody of the nominees. You were shocked when you were announced as one of the candidates. And when it came to the announcement of who the queen was, you were even more surprised that you had won.

Everybody cheered for you when you walked onto the stage, tears streaming down your face, your delicate makeup running slightly. But that happiness was short lived. One of the cheerleaders announced that they had a special video, and pulled a screen down, and a projection start playing. A video of some nameless cheerleader and Johnny, having sex. She egged him on, asking him why he was taking you to Prom. Your tears wouldn't stop when he said he didn't care about you, how he was only using you. You were there for his amusement, and then you would be thrown away.

He tried to tell you otherwise, but you ran away. You ran and you ran, falling down and messing up your dress. You broke the heels of your shoes, but you just threw them away and continued running home. Mom tried to ask you what happened, but you ran to your room, locked the door, and cried and cried for days afterward. There were even days when you woke up, cried, and then went back to bed, that's how much it hurt. Do you remember what I said then? I said I'd make the pain, and all the things associated with it go away. You just had to trust me.

Do you remember how Johnny died? How, drunken and with some girl all over him, he rolled his car into a ravine and killed the both of them? That's not necessarily my fault, but the alcohol was. Do you remember your daddy's girlfriend? Well, not the alcohol and pills, but the wrists were mine. As for Matilda, I felt I would lose you if you learned about responsibility. I couldn't have that. Just like I can't have you crying right now.

Shhhh, shh. Don't cry, alright? Just let the feeling wash over you. Just relax. It's just something in your milk I put in for you. So please, don't cry, okay? You know I don't want to see you cry. Just like I don't want to lose you.

I am always with you.

I was there from the time you were born. I stood in the delivery room, staring down at you before you could even open your eyes to see me. Your parents, relatives and doctors couldn't see me there, in the corner, watching you with cloudy eyes, but I was there from the time you were born.

And I followed you home.

I was with you always, your constant companion. You played with your toys alone while I stared from all angles in nearby mirrors; my matted, clotted hair with oily sweat that hung off my dented forehead like glue. I was always your constant companion, drifting behind your mother's car on your ride to preschool. You alone in the bathroom, but I was on the other side of the door, wind whistling through the bruised hole in my throat. My arms twisted and hanging in their sockets as I stood hunched on the other side of the shower curtain. I wait and follow you. I follow and drift behind you.

I'm not seen. I'm almost not-there in light. You never saw me that morning as I sat across from you at the breakfast table, a shiny red clot hanging from an empty tooth socket as I gaped grotesquely at you. I wonder sometimes if you know I'm there. I think you are aware, but you'll never understand just how close I am.

I spend hours of your day doing nothing more than breathing in your ear.

Breathing -- gagging, really.

I crave to be close to you, to always wrap my crippled arms around your neck. I lie near you ever single night, cloudy eyes staring at your ceiling, underneath your bed, at your sleeping face in the dark.

Yes. You caught me staring occasionally. Your parents came running down to your room one night when you screamed. You were just beginning to talk, so you were only able to cry out ""Man! Man in my room!” You thought you'd never forget the sight of me, with my collapsed jaw hanging to my chest, swinging back and forth. I sank back into your closet and your mother was unable to see me though you pointed and pointed and pointed. You thought you'd never forget when they left that same night. You saw the closet door crack so softly and me crawling across the floor to your bed on all fours, shambling in jerking movements as I pushed myself under your bed on disjointed limbs.

You learned a new word for me: boogeyman. Not quite the monster you thought I was. I'm just waiting and following you always, touching your face with my knotted fingers as you sleep.
You'll see me again soon. Any day now, I'm coming, blunt and brutal. One day you'll walk across the road and -- I believe I'll plow into you with loud roar and a screech.

You rolling on the pavement, rolling under wheels, bluntforce metal fenders and my fingers touching your face again and again.

As you stare up from the cold pavement with cloudy eyes; your matted, clotted hair hanging in your face and your jaw unhinged and swinging to your chest.

You'll see me approaching.

No one else will see me. You will stare past them into my eyes and I'll leer down at you. For the first time in our life, something like a smile will come over my face. You'll swear you're looking into a mirror as clotted red bubbles from our mouths.

I'll lean down, past the doctors and the oogling people and pick you up in my crooked arms.

Our faces will touch. My wings will unfurl. And then you'll have to follow me.

And I am always with you.

/look at pond


You look closer at the pond. The water is perfectly still. You lean closer and closer, trying to see what is glittering. You cannot see your reflection. Something silently jumps out from the water and drags your head under. You are on your knees struggling but you cannot pull away. You see shapes under the water, various colours and shapes, moving around quickly. You cannot see what holds you. The bubbles of your breath are bursting on the surface of the water. Pop. Pop. Pop. The bubbles stop. You are dead.

You need OIL.


/go west


You open the door leading west. It creaks slowly open. You are swarmed by a red haze, and you hear a loud booming noise. A figure mumbles something you cannot understand. You feel pain all over and your legs suddenly break. You fall to the floor, your arms break. Your rib cage collapses. Your ears and nose ooze with blood and pus. Your eyes grow hot and turn to liquid, running down your cheeks and dripping from your chin as you lie screaming. Your neck breaks and you are suddenly lifted up and moving very fast through the door. You are looking back and you see your headless body lying there. Your head is thrown against a stone wall by the mysterious force. You are dead.

They also came across what they believe to be his campsite. There they found many blood and tissue samples that match his DNA. Also there were his cellphone, journal, wallet, GPS device, and watch. Nathen was supposed to go on a 3 day camping expedition from February 10 to February 13. The campsite was completely soaked in what appeared to be fresh blood even though the last entry in the journal is from February 15, his expected date of death. This case has had zero leads, and was recently revealed to the public for any information on what happened to him. Here is his journal:

Journal:

February 10, 2009:
Wooh! Finally made it up here! Really long trip to get up here. I'm going to keep this journal to show it to William when I get back. So in that case, Hey son, daddy can't wait to get back to see you :). Going to start setting up camp before it dusk falls. The weather here is nicer than I expected!

February 10, 2009(Police Department edit: Estimated time: night fall):
Just got done setting up! Now just got to wait for my food to get done cooking. It smells so good! Thank god for vacuum packed chicken! Wish I had a cell signal up here so I could talk to someone, its getting kind of lonely up here. Oh well, at least I have my journal to keep me company...

February 11, 2009:

I had a hard time sleeping last night, heard some rustling around here, but it was probably just some squirrels or something. Oh well, I'm just going to lay around for a while, seeing as theres nothing else to do here.

February 11, 2009(Police Department Edit: Estimated Time: Midday):

Just saw something kind of off in the distance. It was in a thick area of trees so I couldn't get a good glimpse of it. Wish I had brought a hunting rifle or something, if its an animal I could have some fresh meat for dinner tonight!

February 11, 2009(Police Department Edit: Estimated time of day: Night fall):

Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I saw that thing again, but its starting to get closer. It sounds like something is whispering around me. Forget the rest of the trip. First thing in the morning I'm getting out of here.

February 12, 2009:

Oh my god oh my god OH MY FUCKING GOD!! No matter where the fuck I go I always come back to my campsite! North, South, East, West, hell, I could probably drive off a fucking cliff and wind up back there! My GPS still says I'm at the campsite no matter where the fuck I am! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!

February 12, 2009(Police Department edit: Estimated time: Mid-day):

I have to be losing my mind... My watch says its 3 PM but its dark as midnight out here. My watch has to be broken, everything has to be broken... Thats why all this weird stuff is going on... That has to be it.. I'm not going crazy. If I just calm do I ca
[Police Department edit: It is believed at this time Nathen saw something(Possibly the entity he referenced earlier) that frightened him to the point of fleeing his current activities]

[Police department edit: No date posted, estimated date is February 13, 2009]

I saw it! Oh my god I saw it! Sweet Jesus it was a solid black human figure with no fucking eyes! I could see right through its eye sockets! It looked like a child, a hell child! It too dark to go outside, I tried to run and use a flashlight to see what was around me but now its fucking dead! It was fully charged when I left and now its dead! All my food is covered in blood and rotten, my water is black and thick... I'm going to die out here....

[Police Department edit: No date posted, estimated data is February 13 at nightfall]

It came back! Its right out side my tent right now just looking at me! I... I don't know what to do. All I can hear around me is it laughing... It sounds like a child just laughing and laughing. MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT FUCKING STOP! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

February 15, 2009:

I guess this is going to be my last entry. I have no idea what time it is in reality, I don't even know what reality is anymore. Almost all of my stuff is gone. My phone, GPS, watch, tent, all gone. I'm currently hiding in the back of my car. I know that damned thing is still out here. I can hear it shrieking. It sounds like an child shrieking right in my ears. Child-sized blood handprints are on the windows. Every now and then it shakes the car a bit. I know its doing this just to torture me, it wants me to suffer. Hopefully  it will be gone in the morning. Please be g

Police Department: It is estimated that Nathen was killed while writing this entry. The search party found the whole site completely covered in his blood. Bone fragments and teeth were also found scattered throughout the area. Each of his limbs were found torn off hanging from the trees surrounding his campsite. The only exception was the head, which was found impaled on his car's antenna. Everything he described as missing was found at the site, covered in blood. Both his food and water were as he described it. The search party did not see the figure that Nathen described, nor any evidence that a child was there.

It's the middle of Summer, and it still feels like March. Cold fronts have dominated the weather patterns, and it's been nothing but rain for the past 3 weeks. You don't mind the rain, but it keeps pouring and pouring, leaving little else to your eyes and ears. Especially at night, when the rain makes everything colder and more still than before. But you can put up with it. You have to. Warmth is coming, you know it.

Warmth. Warm. Your bed is warm, you say to yourself. You pick yourself up, turn off the lights, and climb into bed. You close your eyes, dreaming of the sunny days sure to come.

You look out of your window that's right beside the bed, and see that the rain hasn't let up yet. You don't mind it. In fact, you pay close attention to the rain, falling onto your roof.

Tap. Tap. Tap. A pattern of sounding taps that create a sea of sound above and around you.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Awash in your warm bed, you sink further and further into sleep.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Nothing can pull you away from your bed, now.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

A loud burst of thunder peals through the sky, and shakes your house. You're awake, startled by the thunder that jostled you from your sleep. Just thunder, you say. Just thunder. You climb out of bed, a little thirsty from sleeping in your warm bed. You head to the kitchen for something to drink. You go to the sink, pull a glass from the cupboard, and get some water. A contrasting coolness to your warm bed. You rinse your glass and look at the rain falling to the ground. Condensation has started creeping up the windows. You stare at the misty glass, surprised at how chilly it is in the middle of the warmest period of the year.

That's when you see the condensation crawl turn into a pattern before you. It works around some curves, long and narrow, creeping into a figure: a hand. The misty glass has revealed a hand print in the window. It's not unnatural for someone's hand to show up, you think. It's just someone's hand, after all. Maybe someone passed by the house when you were asleep. It's not the safest place in the world, but it's safe enough.

The mist continues crawling across the window, and you see that whoever did this left more than his hand streaked on your window. Words slowly form, and the condensation reveals the message.

**IT'S SO COLD OUTSIDE**

You stare at the window. Is there someone outside right now? You glance around, trying to see if there's someone trying to make their escape. A stupid prank, you think. Some kids passing by the house, thinking they can fuck with whoever lives there. You pay it no mind, put away your cup, and begin to walk to the bathroom.

The chill of the night starts to settle in, and you can hear the rain continue on your roof. Tap. Tap. Tap. Then, a soft peal of thunder, then the rain continues it's tapping. You take care of your business, and proceed to wash your hands. Drying them, you look in the mirror, thinking of what you're going to do when the summer sun comes back, and all the things you're going to do in the warm summer air. Yeah, warm. I should get back to bed, you think. Get back to sleep. It's too cold to-

It grabs your attention immediately. Even though your light is on, you see the condensation snaking across your bathroom mirror. It's cold, you think, but not THAT cold! It's shouldn't be moving this quickly! You can only stare at the misting mirror as another hand print reveals itself, longer and more narrow than the previous one. Your head begins to spin as either someone is playing an elaborate prank on you, or you realize you're not alone. You stare at the mirror as it creeps past the hand, waiting for the words to appear.

""'It's so cold outside' again, right?"", you say to yourself. You laugh nervously, wondering if the person is more imaginative than he first seemed. You watch as the mist reveals the message.

**I'M SO COLD**

That... wasn't as scary as you thought it would be. You laugh at the notion you were getting scared, and quickly brush it aside. You dry your hands, turn off the light, and make your way back to your room. As you climb into bed, you wrap yourself up and look out the window. The rain is still going strong, and you can't wait for your summer to actually begin. You listen to the rain as it's rhythm lulls you to sleep.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Your eyes start getting heavy.

Tap. Tap. Tap. The summer is about to begin.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Time to be in the warmth again.

Tap. Tap.

Mist begins crawling across your bedroom window. Right as you were on the verge of sleep, you caught sight of the mist racing across your window. Your eyes pop open as you see a hand reveal itself on the window, but this time, it's higher than the others.

It's just a prank, you say. You lay there watching in silence, the raindrops falling on deaf ears. The mist quickly begins to reveal words, and you stare as the words reveal themselves directly before your eyes.

**YOUR BED IS SO WARM**, written directly in front of you.

You feel a shifting on your bed, as a new weight loads itself directly behind you. You can feel something or someone wet, soaking all the heat from your body. It moves in close, placing it's head close behind yours. It's breath is cold and foul, like a bog or other body of water. It's heavy, ragged breathing is so close to yours that it feels like it's matching you on purpose. Your heart grows cold as you hear it speak to you in a raspy, gargling whisper.

Criticism strongly requested),DoubleHawk4Life,77,19,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/x5mrl/the_bridge_my_take_on_an_old_wives_tale_criticism/,"The man coughed, violently, choking as he inhaled. The fresh air in his lungs was a God-send. He reveled in its cold relief.

	His mind was thick with fatigue. Where was he? As he continued to breathe deep the cool air, he surveyed his surroundings. He knelt atop a bridge of cobblestone, dark standing water on both sides. The sky was a violent shade of green. The man found its color unsettling and disturbing.

	He tried to stand, but his legs were too weak. He felt dizzy and out of place. ""How did I get here?"" he wondered to himself.

	The fog in his mind began to clear, slightly. Complete thoughts slowly formed. ""I have no memory of this place"" he thought. His mind latched to the phrase 'no memory.'

	For a moment, he panicked. He inhaled sharply and scrambled to stand. Legs still weak, mind still fatigued, he fell backwards onto the cobble.

	He lay still, scared and embarrassed, trying to think this through. ""First things first"" he thought. ""Who am I?""

	As he stared to the green sky, he realized, terrifyingly, that he had no answer.

	He heaved himself onto his side, shifting his weight to his elbow. His eyes fell to the side of the bridge, and that's when he saw her. The Angel.

	She was a small thing, undoubtedly holy. Soft blonde curls grazed the nape of her neck. Her eyes were kind, limpid pools of blue. Her soft smile was inviting, welcoming, comforting. Her aura carried a glow, giving her an appearance of the divine. Her toes hovered a few feet from the ground, giving her an appearance of the supernatural.

	It was he who spoke first. ""Who are you?""

	She lowered her head slightly. She put her hands to her sides, showing him her palms. ""Before I answer,"" she replied softly ""I must ask you the same.""

	His voice shook. ""I don't-"" he hesitated, unsure if she could be trusted. ""I don't know. I have no memory of myself or my past.""

	Her smile broadened, still kind. ""Good"" she said. ""Now what is your third wish?""

	""My third wish?!"" The man exclaimed. ""How can I have a third wish when I have no memory of a first or a second?""

	The Angel glided slowly towards him, placing her hand on his chest. ""Tortured soul,"" she said to him. ""You poor tortured soul. Your second wish was to forget everything and start anew.""

	She removed her hand and he flinched. He felt an absence where she had graced him. He felt an empty longing in that exact spot. ""In that case,"" he started, picking his words strategically. ""In that case, for my third wish, I wish to know who I am.""

	The angel retreated, cautiously. Her aura grew dark and forlorn. Gone was her kind smile. It had been replaced by a look of sympathy, and regretful inevitability.

	""Tortured soul,"" she whispered, magic blossoming from her fingers. ""That was your first wish.""",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1343515684.0,,,True,t3_x5mrl,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/x5mrl/the_bridge_my_take_on_an_old_wives_tale_criticism/,

1341506799.0,54,self.creepypasta,w2zzv,I used to be fearless...,MagiCraft,66,12,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/w2zzv/i_used_to_be_fearless/,"I used to be fearless.

Horror movies never really scared me. Scary books had no effect. Haunted houses are meaningless. I was never a child who slept with the covers over their face, or with a night light. As a little girl, I never felt the need to crawl into bed with my mother after having a nightmare. I never really had nightmares to begin with, and the few that I did, most would never consider a nightmare at all.

I've simply never been afraid of what goes bump in the night. Our home security system kept away fears of very real humans with dark intentions, as did our rottweiler, aptly named Killer. As for threats outside the home, well, who could be afraid in a nice, white, upper class community? I've lived in a bland bubble all my life, never knowing what fear is.

So why should I ever be afraid of the dark?

Up until this moment, I haven't been. I saw it as childish and illogical. Of course, I don't feel that way anymore. I'm writing this to you now as a warning because it's too late for me. I know that now, and it's brought on a surreal sort of calm…When I finish warning you, it will be all over. So forgive me if I'm being long-winded…I enjoyed life a bit more than I was once willing to admit.

It all started with what I thought was a virus. I had been linked to a video called ""Girls and Boys Come Out to Play."" It sounded harmless enough. I thought it was an art student's film, perhaps. The person who had linked the video promised it was very good. Well worth watching.

I can't remember the video. All I can remember is the feeling it brought up. It wasn't fear, but it was close. I was uncomfortable. I was unnerved. I was also vaguely ill.

From then on, things only got worse. The background on my computer had changed to a picture of a disturbed looking young woman who stared at me from a black abyss. Every now and then, and growing more frequent by the day, strange noises would emit from my computer, even when the sound wasn't on. Screaming, strange laughter, grinding noises…

At the time, I was annoyed; the fear hadn't settled in quite yet. Then, the faces started popping up, like those ridiculous 'screamers' that scared my friends in high school. Yet these were different. They looked real. They were the faces of the dead; and they had died violent deaths.

I wish I could say that I stopped using the computer, but I couldn't. My job requires me to use my computer frequently. What was I to do? I had no other computer available to me.

I tried to take it in to have the virus removed, but no one could help me. They said there wasn't a virus. They said the computer was fine.

Meanwhile, it got worse. The faces weren't just popping up; they would stay. And with those horrible, rotted eyes, they would hold my gaze. I couldn't look away from them and their terrible, mocking grins. And oh, God…the smell. My computer forever had a vague stench of death around it.

I thought I was going crazy. I thought that perhaps someone was messing with me. The people at the computer repair place didn't know what they were talking about. Something was wrong, but I knew that it had to be something very real that just had to be fixed.

So I got a new computer. Everything was fine for a while, but then it all came back, and in full force. Now there were voices. Now there was screaming. Now, the rotted faces showed their stinking bodies. I could see every maggot, every fly, every pus-filled crevice…And they were calling to me. Telling me that soon, very soon, I'd be joining them. They were so angry that I had tried to get rid of them, and now they would make me pay.

I didn't know what to do. Ignoring the problem wasn't working. I thought maybe it was the fault of a friend from work. Perhaps it came from the emails they had been sending me? I never thought it was the video. Not for a second. After all, that just wasn't logical.

I was at the end of my rope. Today, I unplugged the computer and began packing. I would go on vacation, clear my head, and pray that everything would be back to normal.

A few minutes ago, I realized it would not. The power went out, and for the first time in my life, I felt true fear. I had no idea that in a few moments, it would become mind-numbing.

I stumbled through the house, looking for a flashlight, when I saw that something was still giving off light.

The computer.

The unplugged computer was on, and the woman in the background was moving. Beckoning me over.

I couldn't help myself. I sat down across from her with the darkness caving in all around me. And then the woman, like all of the other images I've seen before, began to rot away. The whole scene rotted away, and then the screen went black. And without light, without a means of seeing my reflection, I saw her behind me for the briefest of moments, a bloody and rusted knife in hand. The computer came back to life, and my old background had returned.

But I know it's not over.

So I've decided to come here. I know you all like to be scared, right? Well, take it from someone who has only very recently known fear: it's not always worth it, and not everything is fun and games.

Of course, you probably wont believe me. Why should you?

The thing is…I haven't been completely honest with you. There was no video. It was a story. A story quite similar to this one, though with subtle plot differences and perhaps better story telling. I know all of you like stories that might give you a good scare. That's probably why you started reading mine.

Now that you've read this, you'll share my fate. I know it's cruel, and perhaps unfair, but it has to be done. I just hope that you can take comfort in knowing that when I'm the woman haunting your computer, I'll be a bit more gentle. If I can, I'll use a blade that's a little less dull. Pictures of those who came before us who are a little less grotesque. Sounds that are a little less alarming.

But then again, you DO like to be scared, right?

Don't worry. I wont ask you to repost this story five times. Nothing will save you. After all, nothing could save me.

The power is still out. And I know, behind me, the woman is waiting for me. I'll see you very soon.

Goodbye for now.

1341128699.0,60,self.creepypasta,vvex6,the day that changed everything.,ch_bu13,73,13,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vvex6/the_day_that_changed_everything/,"things aren't going too well in my marriage. it all began a couple of months ago, when I came back earlier from one of my night shifts at the hospital and found her in bed with another man. although we didn't resort to divorce, although we still talked, we grew distant and cold. it wasn't until she had her accident though, the day she fell from the stairs, that things went further downhill. she spends most of her days sitting in a wheelchair now, staring off at a distance, never saying a word. sometimes I have to seat her near a window so she can look outside, for a change of scenery. she doesn't say it, but I know she appreciates it. in fact she doesn't even talk anymore, she just stares. I haven't worked up the courage to tell her yet, but her silence angers me. every passing day I can feel it growing, this hatred of her nonchalance. after everything I have to do for her now, to take care of her and she can't even find it in herself to thank me? how ungrateful.

everyday I have to wake up, cook breakfast, eat next to her, sometimes reading the news, sometimes talking to her and waiting endlessly for an answer. after that it's off to work where I have to remember after my shift to find some muscle relaxant. since she can't move her body anymore I have to inject her regularly every 8 hours or so to prevent bed sores. just another one of those things that go on unappreciated. arriving home, I sometimes tell her about my day over supper, or sometimes it's silent, if the day was hard. I then have to wash her... it's unbelievable how she manages to smell the way she does at the end of the day, especially when she can't even move! then it's time for bed, although as nights pass, sleep seems to slip further and further from my reach... everyday, rinse and repeat for the past month.

exhaustion was weighing me down and my patience was running thin. one night I just couldn't take it anymore. during supper I was telling her how my day was hard and how I lost a patient on the operating table due to a mistake that I made because I wasn't able to focus properly. when I looked at her, I saw that she wasn't even looking at me. I screamed at her but she didn't even react. she still didn't even look at me. that's when it happened. I snapped and I hit her. I screamed some more but I couldn't remember what I said, it was all a blur. 4 weeks of pent up anger all unleashed at the same time. When it was over and I calmed down, I looked at her. she was staring at me down, but still didn't talk. probably still under the shock of when I struck her. tears ran down my face as I apologized. I took her in my arms and brought her into our room. I promised her that we'd talk about it after I'd have time to calm down. I kissed her on the forehead before leaving. this was the first time that I've kissed her since I caught her cheating on me. even despite the smell (I haven't had the time yet to bathe her today), I felt that the kiss reignited something in me, in us. before leaving the room, I glanced back at her and saw her looking at me. was she smiling? impossible. she hadn't smiled since that accident, hell, not even since we almost left each other. still, I smiled back at her, and remembered why I wanted to marry her in the first place, and why I couldn't find the courage to leave her.

I took my time cleaning up the mess I made during our fight and cleaned the dishes. when I came back in the room, I think it was due to the warm summer, but her smell seemed to have gotten worst and invaded the room. I went over to pick her up to bathe her but instead, I couldn't help myself and kissed her lips instead. I suddenly had an urge I couldn't control and took our clothes off. we made love passionately and at one point I could've sworn that I heard her moan. It sent chills down my spine, though it was impossible that the sound came from her. after I was done I looked at her and gasped. her eyes... they were different. they were... closed? impossible. still I brought my head close to her ear and whispered ""I love you"" as I always did when we were in love. I felt something slowly brush against my neck. I let out a frightened whimper as I realised she was wrapping her hands around my neck. ""I love you too sweetie"" she whispered softly as she held our naked bodies together in an embrace. ""I know you pushed me that day, on the stairs. I forgive you now,"" she said. A tear rolled down my eyes. I started to mutter incoherently some prayers. after all, all this was impossible. my wife died that day. on the stairs. I killed her. she couldn't be talking, she could't be movin, could she?

""we can be together forever now. forever."" she said. her hands wrapped tighter around my neck. I then heard a snap as my neck yielded, much like hers did, that day on the stairs. then, everything went black.

He’d been shot in the side, the tiny bullet slicing through the bones of the right side of his ribcage like warm, soft butter and lodging in the sensitive tissues of his left lung. The other bullets sprayed wildly in every direction, but at least seven more were embedded in his body in various other locations. He wasn’t even aware of the hoarse screams as his heart pumped vital blood through the jagged holes in his flesh. He was in so much pain that he was blocking out everything, the surroundings, the cries of his men and the guttural sounds of the Viet Cong crying in the night. All he could see was the wild illusions of a dying man: where his men were; what was going on at home with his abusive, alcoholic father and his poor overworked mother. He thought about the beautiful girl that he loved, about the last time he’d seen her face; how she’d looked at him; how she leaned in and kissed his throat below his Adam’s apple and told him to come home safe or come home changed. He remembered how her beautiful blue-green eyes overflowed with tears, how she’d cried as he left and told him she wouldn’t ever forget him. He remembered how she used to look at him with those gorgeous, black lash-fringed eyes and how every single damn time he would fall in love with her all over. 

He wondered about his platoon of Marines; the new, green boys fresh out of basic, ready to lay their lives down for the glorious U.S of A, and how almost all of them shrieked and cried in their sleep, longing for home when the night terrors started. He thought about how they would wake up with tears still drying on their smooth, unblemished, boyish cheeks and how they would stand, wipe them away and shake it off as if it were nothing, pretend it didn’t happen. They told themselves and each other that it was going to be okay because the buddy they just watched get blown into a tree by a land mine was in a better place, that the dead man on the side of the road with the star-shaped hole in his face, blood still drying on his shirt was nothing more than an animal, a Gook worth nothing but the lead that ended his life. They told themselves the men that died were martyrs for freedom, but that it would never happen to them. They would never end up bleeding out and dying from a punctured lung in a foxhole under the swamp…

The pain suddenly swallowed up all conscious thought. Aidan’s screams finally rang in his own ears, and they were turning into wet heaving coughs and the coughs were bringing up chunks of his tattered lung and he realized he was bleeding in and bleeding out, drowning in a lake of his own blood and gunpowder-tainted lung. The dirt and shrapnel dug into his already open chest, digging a deeper tunnel under the already shattered ribs and shredding his already ruined lung even more. He blinked rapidly, trying to clear the sweat and blood and dirt and suddenly vomited a fountain of black blood and torn pieces of lung and shuddered. The hot, humid air was turning into a freezing cold and he shuddered once, twice and then spasmed like an epileptic without medication. His vision faded to black and he prayed, over and over for the death throes to end. He thought about the girl back home, crying and missing him, waiting for him to come home. He closed his eyes, drew one last gasp of damp air….

And woke up, breathing hard. He sat up, felt all over his body in panic. The pain was gone. He looked around him. He was still lying underneath the bush he’d picked for the night to guard against the guerillas. He was whole. No bullet wounds. No choking. Nothing but life. He stood up, stretched and walked outside of his foxhole he’d dug the night before in the moss. It was all a nightmare…

Bullet spray slammed into his right side, throwing him back into his foxhole and wrenching a hollow shriek from inside his chest…the last clear thought running through his mind, “Haven’t I been here before…?”

Mother and Father would throw fantastic parties whenever we had guests and I had several friends. On our dining room table, we had fancy silverware and china plates, and embroidered, lacey table cloths. I remember that we were very lucky and that Father had a very nice job. One day, Father was gone. Mother told me he wouldn’t come back, but I waited for him, and waited. After awhile, no one came to our house, not even for holidays or anything. It was just Mother and me for a really long time.
	
   One day, a man came to visit us. He was quiet and a little sulky and had two washed-out eyes that made his face look small. Whenever Mother caught me staring at him, she would scold me and tell me that it was rude. Nonetheless, I watched the strange man, as he seemed to be staying with us now. 
	
   I remember he was very fond of the great, grand piano we had in our light room. He would sit at the piano, his fingers hovering over the keys, the curtains open, letting the light of day shine in, reflecting off the ebony. His eyes would be closed, and I would wonder if he had been turned to stone. But then I would hear the music, and I would see him, eyes still closed, tapping along on the ivory keys. 
	
   Many times, I would sit across the room from him and just listen to him play. He didn’t seem to notice that I was sitting there, so I never announced my presence. One day, however, I was careless and accidently knocked over an antique bear that had been resting on the velvet sofa. The little bell around its neck rung as it met with the floor. The man’s eyes opened and he looked over at me with those dark, windowpane eyes. I just stared for awhile, not sure what a proper response would be, until he grumbled something that I deciphered was an invitation to play the piano. Sheepishly, I walked over and sat down on the bench, looking down at the keys. I remembered playing the piano with Father long ago and how he would never get mad at me, even if I played the notes entirely wrong. 
The man, in the same respects as my father, did not correct me, nor did he smile, or blink, or nod. He simply sat with me, watching the keys move up and down.
I remember then was when Mother came into the room and yelled over to me. She looked angry and worried at the same time. She told me to “Get over here right this minute”, so I got up, looking back at the man, and walked back to stand by her. There, she glared over at the man, who looked across at her. She still had that mixture of fear and hostility in her eyes. Later, she told me, while we were sitting at the empty dining table, “Don’t pay any attention to that man.”
After a few days had passed, and I hadn’t spoken to the man, he was gone. Mother said that it was for the best, and I tried to believe her. 

Weeks went by without so much as a pin falling and I grew bored and tired. I slept for large portions of the light hours and remained hauled up in my room most days, reading. But one day, a Sunday, three visitors came to our house. The small-faced man had returned, and with him, a nun and a priest. I had wondered why he had brought them, but I never asked the man or Mother. 

For a few hours, the priest walked around, sprinkling water over the floors and mumbling some words. The nun stood with the piano man, muttering the same words while holding a rosary to her lips. At this point, Mother was beside me, watching the three with a fixed, horrified expression. The priest’s mumbling soon became fuzzy words, which soon became shouting, chanting. I saw him glance around, then fix his cold, glassy eyes on Mother. He started yelling furiously at her, calling to her, spitting out phrases I couldn’t recognize. I grew scared, but Mother didn’t move. She just stood there, facing the priest, listening to him. Her jaw settled after half an hour of this; she no longer had the same fear in her eyes. She looked over to me, and gestured for me to stand beside her. I hesitated, but my fear got the better of me. Clutching to her arm, Mother started walking toward the front door, right across from the room that still echoed with the priest’s chanting. It would have crossed my mind that this was my first time venturing outside in a very long time, if it hadn’t been for how scared I was. Mother struggled opening the door, which gave me a moment to look back at the three faces, all so somber, as if they were grieving. I was only allowed a second, though, because the next, we were enveloped in light. I remember thinking how odd it was that it should be so bright; I was sure the priest had continued chanting into the night hours. We looked ahead, and I peered into the day as a figure approached. It was Father, wearing his nice, polyester suit; his shoes were polished, reflecting little suns. He and Mother made eye-contact, and Mother looked stunned. I remembered that they hadn’t seen each other in a very long time. Father must have really missed her, cos’ he put his hand on her face and let her cry, using his hand like a handkerchief. He then knelt down and looked at me and smiled. I smiled back, not even remembering what I was scared about so long ago. He scooped me up in his arm and put his other arm around Mother.

1349469222.0,51,self.creepypasta,110dzd,The Art Of Jacob Emory,YES_Im_Taco,64,13,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/110dzd/the_art_of_jacob_emory/,"Ghost stories? Nah, we don’t have anything like that around here. We DO have the story of Jacob, but that’s about as close as you’ll get.

…You really want to know?… Well, I’m not supposed to tell you, but all right, just no interrupting. I don’t have the patience for it.

How to describe Jacob Emory… well, I guess you could say he was the kind of guy you could never take notice of. This isn’t to say he was a bad kid, in any sense- many people in this town thought he was the most reliable person for an odd job in the state- but he never really excelled in anything. He was the living proof behind the statement, “jack of all trades, ace of none.” Most of this was due to his own lack of will. He dabbled in damn near everything this town could offer him, automobiles, radio operation, store management, what have you, but he never stuck with anything. His friends and workers went after him about it a number of times, but everybody got the same unsatisfying response: “It just wasn’t enough.” Needless to say, any friends he kept were either very patient or never spoke of the matter altogether.

It was probably inevitable, then, that Jacob would leave to go abroad. I don’t remember where he went, but I think Gertrude down the street knew before she passed on- you’ll have to scout someone else if you ever get curious. In any case, no one even tried to stop him. Everybody thought that a little travel would stamp the ambition out of him, or else feed it until it was no longer an issue. Hell, we even gave him a sending-off party, which I thought was pretty nice of everybody.

So anyway, he was gone for… six, seven years? Can’t remember. You’ll have to check with someone else about that, too. Anyways, he came back, eventually, and he had changed, obviously enough. He was amiable, energetic, all smiles all the time, and we all quickly learned why. He showed us a souvenir he’d brought back- a solid black stick, the length of a pencil but the texture of chalk. We all wondered why on earth such a simple thing would prompt such a spring in his step, until he gave his demonstration. He took a piece of paper, and with this stick- God, there’s got to be a better word for it- with this stick, he… he drew a crude circle.

It dropped, and rested on the border of the paper, like a stone. It didn’t leave the paper, but it acted out on it, sort of like an old movie projector on a screen.

Son, I know how crazy that sounds, and if you feel like playing skeptic, then you can leave an old man to his craziness, but I know what I saw, even if everyone’s been hushing it up, and that stone he drew dropped. Jake even passed around the paper, and as it was being passed, it rolled around as the paper got tilted. None of us had any words for it- Hell, what was there to say?- but he continued drawing demonstration after demonstration for us, stick figures in various pageants and plays doing everything from fighting each other to making perfect “human” pyramids, and we all thought it was incredible. That was all the go-ahead he needed- he announced that he planned to put on shows to pay for rent and food, where he would draw anything the crowd members wanted. THAT we talked to some length about, and he eventually convinced us that it would be safe, his drawings ethical, the practice lucrative and unique, and the attention would not go anywhere outside of the town’s borders.

Poor Jacob. If I’d not been so swept up in the moment, I might’ve read the signs right then and there, and saved the sorry son of a bitch by snapping the terrible thing in half. But I was younger, we all were, and we saw no problem with encouraging him with what we all saw as an incredible experience to be shared with everyone else. Now, he didn’t have any big radio or television connections, mind you, and the internet wouldn’t come around for another decade, so he did what all people on a shoestring budget do- he advertised his show with fliers. Fliers might not mean anything to you city-folk, but in a small town, they gain a fair glance-over from time to time, and what’s more, Jacob’s managed to stick out by having little figures jump up and down and whatnot to get people’s attention. His first show must’ve gotten nearly sixty or so people, probably a lot more than that.

And his shows were fantastic. Someone would shout out a scene from a play or a comedy sketch, and Jake’s hand would fly over a white wall like a bird. He’d been holding back when he made that stone, that’s for damn sure. His illustrations were all spot-on, and he could make an incredible human figure in minutes. Come to think of it, I don’t remember any of his scenes lasting more than ten minutes to make. They were all really well-done scenes, too- not only could you see a knight charge a castle, Jake would draw the castle’s interior as well, like a wedding cake split down the middle, so you could see the knight scale the walls, fight his way through levels to the dungeon, fight back out with the princess, and make a leaping jump off castle parapets onto his getaway horse all in complete silence. Not realistic, no, but that was part of the appeal- none of us went in there expecting something real. When a scene or a sketch was finished, either the characters would leave off a wall or he’d cover the wall with white paint. This was good, in a way- it gave these shows a time limit, so that when he’d finished with all of the four walls in the room, everyone knew the show was over until the paint dried.

Jake, meanwhile, was changing in a bad way. I’d mentioned that upon his return, he’d been extremely energetic. Well, that energy, that vitality or fervor or whatever you want to call it, it never left him. Not for an instant. Far from it, it seemed to grow in him, and he enjoyed it all too much. His eyes grew wider, he slept gradually less over time, his statements and opinions more radical and frenzied, and though he never was a pushover, he was starting to make people nervous in his company.

A month or two passed, and Jake’s audience grew like a wildfire. Nearly everyone in the town paid to see Jake’s art in action, and he had to rent out larger and larger places for them to sit. He now didn’t stop after one scene was done- he moved directly on to the next, put on the next blank space on the wall, sometimes to the intriguing effect of causing scenes to mingle, which the crowd loved. The subject matter got more wild and immoral, the monsters got more bizarre and creative, the fighters using more impossible weaponry, all for the sake of the crowd’s interests. Jake got steadily more indulgent, which we figured was from the money, and he became a drinker and a womanizer (neither of which got rid of that vitality, by the way.) Some of those women claimed that they’d woken up in the middle of the night to see him scribbling with that stick on a drawing pad, a gigantic grin on his face, and while most of them said that they’d assumed he was drawing them in the nude, there’s rumors that one or two of them got glances at that notepad. Those anonymous few supposedly said that those drawings absolutely weren’t nude pictures, but neither of them, whoever they are, will say what he was drawing. Don’t bother looking for the notepads or fliers, though, they’re all gone now. I’m getting off-track; point is, he was hitting the bottle, and that’s important, because it was that drinking that would eventually ruin everything.

On the night of one of his performances, as he walked in front of his cheering crowd, it was immediately apparent to everybody that he was completely drunk. I was in the front row, and I could smell the bourbon on him from ten feet away. The show started, he went through a bunch of sketches and scenarios the crowd recommended, when at the end someone asked that he draw himself. Everyone cheered the idea, I guessed they’d been wondering what his creations thought of him, and he eventually obliged.

No sooner had Jake finished connecting the final two lines on his coat, than every single character, across the vast, expansive wall, all stopped and looked directly at that illustration. Lovers stopped kissing, clowns stopped laughing, robots stopped fighting pirates, everything stopped and looked at the Jacob-illustration. The crowd died almost instantly- I remember Jake’s face at that moment, pale white, full of terrible comprehension at his mistake, and looking desperately for the cans of white paint he’d forgotten to put out before the show. Everyone else? They were looking at the fake Jacob.

That Jacob reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a black stick of his own, and as we all watched, drew a door. He pushed on his side and the door swung open, allowing him to walk through onto the floor of the auditorium.

The rest was an absolute hellish pandemonium. People screamed and ran for the exits as Jacob’s characters, both those currently on the wall and those which had previously left before being covered up, ran out of their own exit, throwing pies, shooting lasers, blowing fire and poison and the impossible. I was near enough the exit to escape, and gave only one backwards glance. The scene will haunt me forever.

Jacob Emory was being dragged by his creations, kicking and screaming, through the door his copy had made.

The auditorium burned down, obviously enough, but I have no idea how many characters escaped, what happened to the fake Emory, or how many people died. The fire brought the fire department from the nearest cities up to over a hundred miles away- they in turn brought the police force, which brought the government, which hushed up everything. They took the fliers and any art Jake had made, and swore everyone to secrecy or else life detainment. The fire was blamed on a cigarette in the garbage during a basketball game, and we all eventually went on with our lives. Jacob was made to never have existed.

In retrospect, I realize everything. Jacob hadn’t been creating illustrations. Illustrations don’t move, much less act or attack-they’re just images people see, shadows made to look like real things. Jacob had been making life- actual thinking things in some alternate dimension, using a power that was never meant to fall to mortal hands. He got drunk on his power. His punishment was probably well-deserved.

Incidentally, the government screwed up on two different accounts. They did a damn good job silencing everyone, but proof remains. The ruins are still there, you know. The auditorium’s ruins. I hear they’re going to start reconstruction soon, which will wipe out any remaining evidence someone can definitely see, but I went back there once, several years after the fire- just once. Amidst the rubble, covered in ash, I saw something squirming. I looked closer. It was Jacob Emory’s hand on the wall. Exactly like it had been three years ago, (sweaty but calloused, I remember,) but it was constantly flailing, as if the body it was supposed to be attached to was still writhing in flames.

That was mistake number one. Number two was those creations.

Like I said, I don’t know how many escaped, nor how many the government agents found and caught, but I will say only this- Those tall grass meadows on the outskirts of town? Don’t go into them. Ever. You were asking about those white figures you’ve seen at night, right?

When I was in medical school, I went on-call in the Psychiatric Ward. A patient was referred for ward admission and I was tasked to do the initial medical history, physical, and psychiatric evaluation.

The patient was an able-bodied male in his late thirties, lucid, and conversant. This was his story.

""I was fine until only a couple of weeks ago. I take care of my nephew and niece while my brother worked because he had to stay out most of the day and I'm currently out of work. We always got along well and I was their favorite uncle. As the kids grew, they got more rowdy and physical in their play. Nothing unexpected from growing kids. But I found myself increasingly less tolerant of their behavior and how they started treated me. I don't know what I did for them to start disrespecting me but it reached a point where I started entertaining thoughts of physically hurting them to teach them a lesson. The thoughts got more and more vivid until I was convinced that if I didn't seek professional help, I might act on these thoughts and inflict harm to innocent children whom I love dearly. That's why I'm here today."" The whole time he was composed. Occasionally teary-eyed with remorse, but calm. I thought there might have been a mistake and he was not a psychiatric patient at all.

I interviewed the patient's mother and she said, ""There is no nephew, niece, or any other child in the house. There never has been. We are all alone.""

The most chilling thing about it is not the sudden dark twist in the story but the truth that at the end of the day, even as your read this, the line between reality and fantasy is in itself a hallucination.

Mom would put me to sleep in the upstairs room and slip downstairs to sleep with my father, leaving me and my brother alone in the upstairs room.
An hour or so after we'd been put to bed, a scratching noise could be heard above our heads in the attic every night. It was slow...like a pendulum. Back and forth, it'd sweep across the ceiling, at times skittering faster before fading back to a slow scratch. At first we were scared, as children are apt to be, but we learned to live with it and it comforted us in some strange way. It was kind of like ""white noise,"" and it helped us sleep.

Well, I'm a grown man now. Grandma passed away some years ago. As we were cleaning out her house, Mom and I found ourselves in the attic. We were clearing out some old boxes and stuff when I came to the middle of the wooden floor. Although years of dust had covered them, there were still visible scratches in the wood.

I laughingly remarked to my mother about hearing a scratching noise when I used to sleep in the room below and my Mom's face drained of color. She gently took me by the shoulders and told me the story about how HER Grandpa, the father of MY Grandmother, had lost his job in the Great Depression and could barely afford to feed his family. He came home one night and hung himself in the attic with a horse bridle.

Apparently he regretted his decision, because he struggled to gain his footing near the end by flailing his feet. His heavy boots had gouged the wood where he had hung himself.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,black,True,t3_oyfsi,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/oyfsi/pendulum/,

They are farmers and own a huge amount of land in Huntsville.  My uncle owns a big house and a bunch of trailers they put out in the woods for hunting and camping.  While I was down south my cousins suggest we go out camping for a few days.  We get to the camp and it's obvious something is weird.  The air has a strange electric smell like right before a storm like ozone.  We don't think much of it and unpack and go down to a little creek to swim for a few hours.  All of the sudden some older white guy and a white teenager come out of the bushes.  He has a shotgun in the crook of his arm and says hello.  He asks what we're doing this far back in the woods.  I tell him about my uncle, who he knows, and say we're camping out.  He tells us we need to be real careful out here and stick together because there is a big animal in the woods.  His son, who is my age, asks if he can hang out with us.  His dad says ok.

We end up playing football and dicking around.  There's me, the white kid ""Tanner"", 5 of my cousins, and 4 of their friends.  5 girls and 6 boys.  We were all around 15-17.  We ended up just dicking the day away and going back to the camp and getting set up for a campfire even though we had trailers with kitchenettes.  Tanner said he wants to run home and ask his dad if he can come camping with us.  His families property sits up against my uncle's.  My cousin ""Rooster"" says he's going to go with him since it's getting pretty dark.  One of the girls says she's going to tag along.  At this point it's about 7:00 and it's starting to get pretty dark.  They take flashlights and head off on the trail towards Tan's property.  The rest of us just chill and make smores, drink, and hit on the girls.

About 30 or 40 minutes later there's the smell of ozone again.  You could smell it over the smell of the fire we had going.  It had a really nasty copper smell like the smell you get after you've had a nosebleed.  It wasn't exactly like dried blood but it was that strong, metallic, back-of-your-throat smell.  We immediately think that it's some kind of electrical malfunction or someone left a hotplate on or some shit.  We search the trailers and nothing is on but we call can smell it.  All of the sudden we hear people booking down the path toward us.  Rooster, Tan, and the girl all come running into the clearing out of breath.  They don't even break stride they all just run into the trailer next to where the fire is.

We all NOPE the fuck out of there and get into the trailers.  They end up calming down a bit but even Rooster is crying his fucking eyes out.  Meanwhile, the fire is getting lower and lower so my other cousins say ""fuck it"" and are about to go outside and start up the generator.  Tanner says ""fuck no"" and locks the front door.  ""Aint nobody else going outside.""  He's been crying too and his eyes are bloodshot and puffy and his pants are dirty as shit.  He goes on to tell us that they went up to his house and his father said it was ok for him to go out camping.  He just needed to make sure they were careful on their way back and maybe they should take one of the hunting rifles just in case.  Evidently, Tanner had seen something in their yard a few days before and then one of their pigs had turned up ripped in half and eaten.  They assumed it was just some big cats or coyotes even though they don't usually fuck with live animals.  He had gone upstairs and packed his stuff and told his dad they would be ok without the rifle because coyotes avoid people.  So they started walk  back towards where we were camping.

Rooster finally stops crying and shaking.  The girl had stopped too but she was just staring out the window with a dumb look on her face.  He says they had gotten halfway into the woods toward the camp when they started to hear shit in the forest.  It was almost pitch black by this time so they weren't sure what the fuck it was.  The girl said she heard something in the bushes right off the trail and they all beamed their flashlights over there.  There was something standing back in the woods in a little hollow.  Rooster said they had shouted at him and told him he was scaring the fuck out of them and that he was a dick.  He said that's when he realized that the guy was facing away from them.  So they keep walking and they start to smell the nasty coppery ozone smell and they say the look off into the forest on the opposite side and it's a dude standing in the forest backwards but this time he's slightly closer to the path.

So now they start powerwalking and Tan keeps saying he should have taken the fucking rifle.  As their telling the story the smell is still super strong even inside the trailer.  They say after they started walking faster, that a kind of low gibbering had started coming from out of both sides of the woods.  They started booking it back to the trailer.  The girl said she flashed her flashlight out into the woods to the side of the trail and had seen something jerking itself through the forest and the gibbering got louder and louder.  When they could see the light from the campfire something had come out of the woods and about 40 yards behind them onto the trail so they just flat out ran as hard as they could to the trailer.

So we're out in the fucking woods and at this point we're assuming it's some rednecks or some shit trying to fuck with us.  All of the sudden, my other cousin ""Junior"" starts going on about how he went to school with a Native American kid that was telling him about goat man or some shit.  We promptly tell him to shut the fuck up because the last thing we need is some spooky story at this point.  But he keeps going on and on about how it's the fucking goat man and how we're in his woods and blah blah blah.  Now, at the time, I had never heard of goat man or any of that.  But a couple years ago, the year before I graduated from college, I had a Menom for a roommate and I ended up asking him about it.  To sum it up it's basically a fucking man with the head of a goat and he can shape shift and he gets among groups of people to terrorize them.  It's also suppose to be kind of like the Wendigo and it's bad mojo to even talk about it and even worse if you see it.  Keep in mind, I didn't know this back when I was 16.  So my cousin is going: ""the goat man is gonna get in and fucking get us.""  The girls are all terrified and my cousins and I are all fucking trying to figure out if it's just some hillbillies or if it's some animal.

So all of the sudden the smell just goes away.  Like to this day, I haven't experienced anything like it.  Usually smells fade away or become faint but this was literally there one second and just gone the next second.  So after an hour, making it around 9 or 10, we've stopped shitting bricks enough to go back outside and stoke the fire again.  We figure it was just some assholes trying to fuck with us so we don't go back home.  We think that if we do, they'll just chase us through the woods or some shit.  Nothing else weird happens that night and we stay another night.  For the main part of the night nothing happens.  At about 1 in the morning we're outside getting drunk and telling ghost stories.  As someone finishes a spooky story, I don't remember what it was about, the smell comes back.  And it is so fucking strong that one of the girls literally starts vomiting.  I stand up, and you can actually feel how clammy th air is, and I say we should get inside.  This isn't right.  We should have just fucking left.  We all go back inside and were standing around.  My cousin keeps going on about how it's the goat man.  My cousin Rooster tries to shut him the fuck up.  All the while I'm just feeling that something is wrong and I can't figure out what the fuck it is.

We end up sitting in there for a while and the smell is just as strong.  We're terrified and all huddled in this camper.  We end up cooking brats for everybody because no one wants to go outside.  It's on of those packs with 4 brats in it and we have a total of 3 packs.  I grill them up on the stove and give everybody a hot dog.  I get mine.  After a while one of my cousins gets up and goes over to the stove to get another one.

He starts grumbling about how the fuck do I get 2 and everyone else only got 1.  I look at him like he's fucking stupid.  I tell him that everybody only got 1 because there were only 12 brats.  If he wants more he should open up a new pack and cook some more.  That's when the girl that had been with Rooster and Tan just starts screaming ""OH JESUS OH LORD GET OUT!""  She's crying and shivering, and it dawns on my cousin who was standing up what the fuck was wrong.  Me and him both glance around the room and then I feel my heart fucking sink.  I run the fuck out of the cabin and the girl runs out with us.  The trailer door bangs against the side of the trailer as everybody books it out of there.  One of my cousin's friends asks us what the fuck was wrong.  I start counting us and there is only 11 now.

I shit you not.  My cousin verified.  There had been 12 people in the trailer.  Being that everybody didn't really know each other well, nobody had really noticed the whole fucking time that there was an extra person.  Then I realized earlier that I had kind of noticed something was off.  You know how you are just dicking around, having a good time you don't sweat the small shit?  You don't always keep track of certain stuff but now I'm dead sure that someone else had been in the trailer with us and that they had been there for at least a fucking day eating with us.  What makes it worse is I couldn't figure out which one because I don't think anyone ever actually interacted with the other person/thing.

The girl keeps praying to jesus and we're all sitting outside.  Eventually, we get big ass sticks and go back inside the trailer and there's nobody there.  We count again and there's 11 people.  Everyone gets in the trailer and lock the door.  We explain what the fucked happened and the girl says that she realized it too and when she was about to say something the person sitting next to her had grabbed her leg hard and leaned over and said something she couldn't understand.

So we are pretty much scared as fuck and we huddle together.  I fall asleep.  When I wake up the sun is just coming up and half the people are asleep and the other half are packing our shit up.  We want to walk back home but like 4 people want to stay until the sun is all the way up.  Some of the pople think that we're just fucking around and still want to stay at the trailers.  I just want to get the fuck out of the woods.

The girl's name is Keira, the one that the goatman had touched.  Anyway I asked her if she really thinks it was something bad and she says she just wants to go home and doesn't want to stay out in the woods for another night.  So we decide to split people up and the 4 that want to go can go and that I have to stay because I have the keys to the trailers and since it's my uncle's I have to lock up.  I'm super pissed at this point because I feel like people aren't taking this shit seriously and I definitely don't want to be out in the woods for another night.  So I spend the rest of the day trying to convince the rest of the people, 4 guys and 4 girls, that we need to get the fuck out of dodge.  Tanner leaves with the other group to go get a rifle and says he's going to be back.  So there are just 7 of us left at this point and it's about 4:00.

At around 5 he hasn't made it back yet and we're getting extremely fucking antsy and the only reason I stopped begging them to go back was because he went to get a gun.  At about 5:30 or so when my cousin that did stay says that that girl Keira is outside.  We all look outside and sure enough she's standing by the firepit with her back to the cabin.  I'm thinking to myself: she was so fucking scared why the hell would she come back?  And then I get this nasty feeling in my gut.  Keep in mind, the whole time the coppery smell has been gone but now I realize I can smell just a twinge of it.

I say this to the rest of them and they all laugh at me and ask if I set this all up to scare them.  I'm look at them like, ""I'm not fucking bullshitting you right now"".  I ask them why the fuck would I play like that?  So one of the girls goes outside to get Keira.  She gets halfway to her and stops cold.  Keira starts heaving.  I don't know how the fuck to describe it.  Convulsing?  Sort of like if someone with their back turned was laughing without actually making any sound.  And it was the fact that I thought this that made me realize there was not a fucking sound in the whole woods.  It was dead silent.  This was late September so usually you could hear big ass geese honking or kind or birds or squirrels chattering.  So I step out the door and tell her to come back in the fucking trailer right god damn now.

She backs up a little bit towards the trailer and we lock the fucking door and pull down all of the shades except one.  We put someone in a chair to keep an eye on her.  She stands there for another 20 minutes or so then the guy turns to say that she's still there.  Then there's a huge fucking bang on the door.  We all jump the fuck up and scramble around the living room of the trailer.  The banging is super fucking loud.

On a recent road trip exploring America, we were shootin shit and exchanging ghost stories and laughing at similarities and differences between American ghost stories and Indian ghost stories when I asked her if she’s ever experienced anything supernatural. Her eyes widened as she averted her eyes to the window. Just when the silence was about to be too much for me, she softly responded “Yes. A few. One is troubling.”

“When I was a second year in college, I stayed at in an all-girl hostel [dorm]. I made many friends. We were all very happy to be in school away from our conservative parents. The hostel was so much fun, but it was a very very old building. Electricity was only put in the rooms. Sometimes, candles were placed along the windows if a watchman was present, but normally once you left the rooms, you were faced with complete darkness. It’s common to wake up someone if you needed to walk down to the restroom at the end of the hall. We all had a childish fear of being alone in the dark.

One night, I had to use the restroom. It was about 4am. I went to my friend’s bed and tapped her on the arm. She immediately opened her eyes as soon as I touched her. I apologized for bothering her, and told her I needed to pee. She smiled at me and hopped out of bed. All the way down the hallway, she laughed and danced. I could not see her at all, but her bangles clanked together loudly and the bells on her anklets jingled softly. It was very calming. I laughed and sashayed my hips down the hallway with her, too tired to match elaborate arm movements. She said nothing to me, though occasionally I heard her hum one of our favorite Bollywood songs. The same thing happened on our return. I fell back asleep easily.

I awoke fairly late the next morning to the sound of men in our room. They surrounded her bed. I bolted from my bed, prepared to protect my friend, when I realized they were administrators of the college. I peered over closer. My friend’s lifeless eyes were fixated on my bed; the same smile on her face. Suicide. Her time of death was 11:30pm, almost 5 hours before I woke her.”

1374179595.0,53,self.creepypasta,1il1bk,"One of my favorite pastas. Very subtle. ""Killswitch""",niyou77,73,20,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1il1bk/one_of_my_favorite_pastas_very_subtle_killswitch/,"In the spring 1989 the Karvina Corporation released a curious game, whose dissemination among American students that fall was swift and furious, though its popularity was ultimately short-lived.

The game was “Killswitch.”

On the surface it was a variant on the mystery or horror survival game, a precursor to the Myst and Silent Hill franchises. The narrative showed the complexity for which Karvina was known, though the graphics were monochrome, vague grey and white shapes against a black background. Slow MIDI versions of Czech folksongs play throughout. Players could choose between two avatars: an invisible demon named Ghast or a visible human woman, Porto. Play as Ghast was considerably more difficult due to his total invisibility, and players were highly liable to restart the game as Porto after the first level, in which it was impossible to gauge jumps or aim. However, Ghast was clearly the more powerful character–he had fire-breath and a coal-steam attack, but as it was above the skill level of most players to keep track of where a fire-breathing, poison-dispensing invisible imp was on their screens once the fire and steam had run out, Porto became more or less the default.

Porto’s singular ability was seemingly random growth–she expanded and contracted in size throughout the game. A Kansas engineering grad claimed to have figured out the pattern involved, but for reasons which will become obvious, his work was lost.

Porto awakens in the dark with wounds in her elbows, confused. Seeking a way out, she ascends through the levels of a coal mine in which it is slowly revealed she was once an employee, investigating its collapse and beset on all sides by demons similar to Ghast, as well as dead foremen, coal-golems, and demonic inspectors from the Sovatik corporation, whose boxy bodies were clothed in red, the only color in the game. The environment, though primitive, becomes genuinely uncanny as play progresses. There are no “bosses” in any real sense–Porto must simply move physically through tunnels to reach subsequent levels while her size varies wildly through inter-level spaces.

The story that emerges through Porto’s discovery of magnetic tapes, files, mutilated factory workers who were once her friends, and deciphering an impressively complex code inscribed on a series of iron axes players must collect (This portion of the game was almost laughably complex, and defeated many players until “Porto881″ posted the cipher to a Columbia BBS. Attempts to contact this player have been unsuccessful, and the username is no longer in use on any known service.) is that the foremen, under pressure to increase coal production, began to falsify reports of malfunctions and worker malfeasance in order to excuse low output, which incited a Sovatik inspection. Officials were dispatched, one for each miner, and an extraordinary story of torture unfolds, with fuzzy and indistinct graphics of red-coated men standing over workers, inserting small knives into their joints whenever production slowed. (Admittedly, this is not a very subtle critique of Soviet-era industrial tactics, and as the town of Karvina itself was devastated by the departure of the coal industry, more than one thesis has interpreted Killswitch as a political screed.)

After solving the axe-code, Porto finds and assembles a tape recorder, on which a male voice tells her that the fires of the earth had risen up in their defense and flowed into the hearts of the decrepit, pre-revolution equipment they used and wakened them to avenge the workers. It is generally assumed that the “fires of the earth” are demons like Ghast, coal-fumes and gassy bodies inhabiting the old machines. The machines themselves are so “big” that the graphics elect to only show two or three gear-teeth or a conveyor belt rather than the entire apparatus. The machines drove the inspectors mad, and they disappeared into caverns with their knives (only to emerge to plague Porto, of course). The workers were often crushed and mangled in the onslaught of machines, who were neither graceful nor discriminating. Porto herself was knocked into a deep chasm by a grief-stricken engine, and her
fluctuating size, if it is real and not imagined, is implied to be the result of poisonous fumes inhaled there.

What follows is the most cryptic and intuitive part of the game. There is no logical reason to proceed in the “correct” way, and again it was Porto881 who came to the rescue of the fledgling Killswitch community. In the chamber behind the tape recorder is a great furnace where coal was once rendered into coke. There are no clues as to what she is intended to do in this room. Players attempted nearly everything, from immolating herself to continuing to process coal as if the machines had never risen up. Porto881 hit upon the solution, and posted it to the Columbia boards. If Porto ingests the raw coke, she will find her body under control,and can go on to fight her way out of the final levels of the mine, which are impassable in her giant state, clutching the tape containing this extraordinary story. However, as she crawls through the final tunnel to emerge aboveground, the screen goes suddenly
white.

Killswitch, by design, deletes itself upon player completion of the game. It is not recoverable by any means, all trace of it is removed from the user’s computer. The game cannot be copied. For all intents and purposes it exists only for those playing it, and then ceases to be entirely. One cannot replay it, unlocking further secrets or narrative pathways, one cannot allow another to play it, and perhaps most importantly, it is impossible to experience the game all the way to the end as both Porto and Ghast.

Predictably, player outcry was enormous. Several routes to solve the problem were pursued, with no real efficacy. The first and most common was to simply buy more copies of the game, but Karvina Corp. released only 5,000 copies and refused to press further editions. The following is an excerpt from their May 1990 press release:

""Killswitch was designed to be a unique playing experience: like reality, it is unrepeatable, unretrievable,and illogical. One might even say ineffable. Death is final; death is complete. The fates of Porto and her beloved Ghast are as unknowable as our own. It is the desire of the Karvina Corporation that this be so, and we ask our customers to respect that desire. Rest assured Karvina will continue to provide the highest quality of games to the West, and that Killswitch is merely one among our many wonders.""

This did not have the intended effect. The word “beloved” piqued the interest of committed, even obsessive players, as Ghast is not present in any portion of Porto’s narrative. A rush to find the remaining copies of the game ensued, with the intent of playing as Ghast and discovering the meaning of Karvina’s cryptic word. The most popular theory was that Ghast would at some point become the fumes inhaled by Porto, changing her size and beginning her adventure. Some thought this was wishful thinking, that if only Ghast’s early levels were passable one would somehow be able to play as both simultaneously. However, by this time no further copies appeared to be available in retail outlets. Players who had not yet completed the game attempted Ghast’s levels frequently, but the difficulty of actually playing this enigmatic avatar persisted, and no player has ever claimed to have finished the game as Ghast. One by one, the lure of Porto’s lost, unearthly world drew them back to her, and one by one, they were compelled towards the finality of the vast white screen.

To find any copy usable today is an almost unfathomably rare occurance; a still shrink-wrapped copy was sold at auction in 2005 for $733,000 to Yamamoto Ryuichi of Tokyo. It is entirely possible that Yamamoto’s is the last remaining copy of the game. Knowing this, Yakamoto had intended to open his play to all enthusiasts, filming and uploading his progress. However, to date, the only film which has surfaced is a one minute and forty five second clip of a haggard Yamamoto at his computer, the avatar-choice screen visible over his right shoulder.

Yamamoto is crying.

Something not quite right, just a little out of synch. Just that tiniest fraction wrong. You did a double take, looked at it funny for a second, and then went on with your day. I was....in the process...i think.....of being transitioned. You probably are too. You recognize the signs, but for some reason your higher brain just shuts down that little lizard brain deep down inside that's screaming for you to get the fuck out, scurry into a tiny hole and hide. 

I guess, they are demons? Maybe. Maybe that's not right. They're projections...of us...like a kind of anti-soul. Just a facsimile of everything about you just on the other side, waiting...watching....imitating you on the other side of the mirror. 

I guess I can thank my brother Shane, That dumbfuck asshole. If it's still him anymore. Two weeks ago he came by to visit, and we went to go eat. At some point, the shitbag stuck his gum on the backside of my rearview mirror. Strange that something so....small...can wake you up. It was during a transition spell, that's the best way to describe it. You've probably had one too. Where you've been driving....and you suddenly just...wake up? You haven't been asleep...but it's like, you weren't there. Like your body being on autopilot while you take a dump in the back of your mind. I remember feeling the slightly moist sticky gum as I pressed my finger firmly into it. I remember thinking ""That son of a BITCH!"" and it just suddenly dawned on me....

I was adjusting the mirror to look at myself. I could see myself, through my eyes, but it wasn't me. It was my face, but I wasn't the one wearing it. The look in my eyes, that ....smile....I had. I almost had a heart attack right there in the street. I swerved, nearly clipped a light post, and finally stopped on the shoulder. Got out and threw my guts up. People driving by were giving me the whole gambit of looks. Crazy guy, drunk, sucks to be you dude...except for one lady. She didn't even look in my direction, just drove past, looking at herself in the rearview mirror with that wide eyed, open-mouthed face of pure joy. 

I still have these...little hiccups in time. Do you have those? Where you're getting ready in the morning, and you don't remember brushing your hair but it's done, or you leave from work at 5 and when you get home it's 6:15 but you only live twenty miles away. I know it's part of the process where they trade...with you. I see people all the time now...just completely checked out. Smiling like a hyena at themselves in the reflection in the window of the grocery store...or just walking down the street holding a makeup mirror in front of them like some kind of clown with no makeup. 

I saw my first swap in the coffee shop three days ago.....It was a young woman. She had gone into that ""trance"" right in the middle of the dining room. Wide eyes, mouth agape in that ungodly smile, she was just admiring herself in wall mirror hanging next to the entrance door. What's weird is that no one noticed. Dozens of people just flowed around her like she wasn't standing there like a lunatic. Then I noticed the others. Three other ones scattered around the store, same unnerving expression of unrelenting joy on their face were just frozen in place, watching her. I tried to watch as discretely as possible. She leaned in...closer...and her face...I wish I could ease your imaginations and tell you that she stuck her face into the mirror like a pool of silver...but it wassn't like that. She stuck her face into the mirror like her face literally melted onto the glass. I'm not ashamed to say that I peed myself a little bit at that moment. Not enough to show on my jeans, but enough that my underwear was damp. her face melted onto the mirror and she just spasmed and jerked. her arms flailing and I swear every bone in her body was cracking and breaking. This one older guy, he walks in and just veers around her, like she's a potted plant and not some fucked up marionette puppet. One of her arms brushes against him and I see it. I see it on his face for just a moment, that look of sheer terror and sadness and everything wrong...but then it passed and he just simply didn't notice her anymore. After a few minutes, she pulled away, and just walked out. The others acted normal too. Talking, drinking, nothing unusual.

The lapses in time and the deja vu and all those little warning signs are getting more frequent now. Whatever I interrupted once before isn't going to just go away. It already staked claim in me and it will have me by force if not by corruption. I've removed all the mirrors and pots and metal in my apartment. Taped the windows. Last night I caught myself smiling into a cup of water before I shook it off. I just.....don't want to wake up locked away in a tiny dark room in my head where I no longer even realize that I am me. Watching but not really watching someone else drive my body. I'm going to turn off this computer monitor and try and sleep. I'll write some more later.

It’s been a year. Has it? No it’s been two maybe three years since my “Incident.” I wish I could say I learned something. Have I? No, I couldn’t have, the questions continue to plague my mind rotting away my sanity, or has it withered and died already? No, no… I’m still sane enough to tell my story before the darkness takes me. I know its coming. The screeching in the middle of the night as I lay terrified in my bed has grown closer. Keeping me up for weeks on end before I collapse away into the night mare it’s fed me. 

The nightmares… how I wish I could make them stop. Always the same thing every time. Staring into its dark eyes as it tells me, “You still owe me, Dustin. I’ve grown tired of the games.” It says in its deep raspy voice. “I will not be put off longer.” Then, it gives me visions. Visions of the punishment that awaits me. Limbs being torn off and devoured to fuel this beast. I wait in the dark chambers of the nightmare for him and each time he punishes me in a different way. The horrible images of my body being torn and spewed across the room. I can hear him now, as I write this I hear him calling my name. In my last moments I hope to tell my story to you.

Late one night a couple friends and I scavenged the internet for something to give us our next scare. We were horror junkies and never really satisfied. We found a particularly scary instructional story stating that if you stand in front of a mirror (Original right?) and scream “I Offer you everything in my name so that you may manifest yourself, and bestow upon me your knowledge. With your name I seal this pact. Ofödda.” That some mysterious “being” would come and tell you all of life’s secrets but for a price. The price wasn’t specified. We could assume that it was fake from the beginning and kept going on our search for something scary. Finding nothing we decided to try that “Infinite knowledge” thing. We all filed into my bathroom and flicked out the light. Now I know a lot of people are afraid of mirrors and every creepypasta survival guide says “Stay clear of all mirrors” but honestly we’ve tried every mirror creepypasta that there is with no results, so mirrors never scared me really.

Anyways… there he is again. Worming his way in to my mind, the pain is intense. I have to go on, my story must be told. We were in my bathroom. We put our hands on the mirror like the story told us to and flicked off the lights. Since it was my idea to do this, I got the honor of saying the pact. I breathed in, something felt wrong, I still can’t put a finger on what it was, but it sent a shiver down my spine, I should have listened. I started “We offer you everything in our name so that you may manifest yourself, and bestow upon us your knowledge. With your name we seal this pact” and all at once we said “Ofödda.” My head started pounding, like it was pushing against the sides of my head trying to break my skull from the inside. Then, it stopped, just stopped out of nowhere just no more pain. Then I heard the creature for the first time. I don’t think words could describe how awful it was to hear it’s voice, and inside my own damn head! 

“It has been done.” It said, it’s voice booming in my head drowning out my hearing and knocking me off balance it was that loud. When I came to, my three friends were looking at me. There was something different about them though. Their eyes, they were filled with sheer terror. Not the kind that you got from watching a horror movie, but when you’re genuinely afraid for your life. We said nothing about what happened, but I knew they heard him too. They all left my house that night without saying a word. For the next week it was the same old thing as it was before our “pact.” I went to work and came back every day, then sat around and watched T.V. then tried to go to bed, usually to no avail. However, exactly one week from the day we did the ritual something strange occurred. 

I was just sitting and then, all of the sudden I got a massive headache. Like off the scales painful. Then the pain stopped. That’s when things turned up. I found that I had this library full of knowledge in my head! I could think of anything and instantly knew everything about whatever it was. Like my car broke down and I thought to myself “How can I fix this” and suddenly I knew everything about auto diagnosis and repair, fixed my car in seconds flat. There was nothing I couldn’t do, no challenge to daunting for my mind and it required no effort at all I just thought and there it was a complete dictionary on anything I wanted.

Eventually I contacted my other friends to see if I was the only one and as expected I wasn’t. All four of us started to meet up again and challenge each other’s knowledge, but it appeared that we all were matched evenly. Everything was fine for a couple days after I had acquired this knowledge. However, something strange happened not long after. My friends, one by one slowly started disappearing and no one could figure out why. Hell, no one even noticed they were gone they just dropped out of existence sort of. Then the voices and the screeching started, and I remembered that I was still in debt.

Late one night, I woke at an extremely late hour. I knew it was time for collection. Then I heard it’s familiar voice pierce the darkness. Dread filled my body and my stomach took a high dive.

“Come now” It spoke, it’s raspy voice penetrating the dark air. “Don’t tell me you didn’t expect me. I’m here to collect”

“What are you? Show yourself!” I yelled. I saw a dark mass moving in the darkness. It was hideous, it looked like just a skeletal structure of a large wolf, but with bits of skin stitched on here and there. It’s face was hideous to look at, almost as if someone was making a mask out of random bits of skin and tied it on the skull with a large rope. It’s eyes were just sunken black holes that were slightly hypnotic. Its sharp toothed grin stretched across its face. As soon as I laid eyes on the beast, my library opened a file on it only containing one word, Ofödda. In that instance, I knew what he wanted.

“I held my end of the deal” its raspy voice spoke, his jaw unmoving.

“I haven’t gotten to use the full extent of my knowledge, let me do some good” I pleaded, hoping to reason with him. He laughed, each laugh stabbing chilling daggers in my back.

“I’m surprised, you haven’t used your knowledge to answer lifes biggest questions” the creature bellowed. The meaning of life was my first thought. Instantly my library mind opened a file. As I read through the mental file, a tear slid out of my eye. My mind is deteriorating now, and I can’t go much longer. I can see him in the corner of my eye, he’s here to collect, to make me part of him. 

I figure now is a good time to give you some truths. First, ofödda means the unborn, I know that now. Second, the meaning of life is hidden for a reason, but to the curious, don’t worry this brings me to my final truth. There was no mirror or pact with the unborn. The truth is, I read a story, very similar to this one. He survives off the knowledge of others. I’m very sorry I did this to you all, but don’t worry, soon you’ll know everything, even the meaning of existence. One last thing, ignore the creaking in the middle of the night, sometimes it’s better not to know.

Due to the circumstances surrounding her birth, the doctors couldn’t be sure if Angelica would have normal brain activities. They suggested we visit every month for a checkup. I agreed, though Charlotte scoffed, saying she would have nothing to do with this. True to her word, she never once went with me as I took Angelica for her checkups. She didn't even offer to help pay the hefty bills. Said she wouldn't have her money go towards a child that wasn't hers.

Throughout her first year on the earth, Angelica was, for all intents and purposes, a normal baby. She would cry, sleep, laugh, and everything else you would expect a baby to do. Every month I would bring her to the neurologist for a checkup. This was perhaps the only part of her day that wasn't normal for a baby. The neurologist would inform me each visit that she was doing very well, but I would have to keep bringing her in, just in case something were to change. Once again, I agreed.

When Angelica was about a year old, Melinda and Chaz Finster, who were both old friends of my brother and I, were excited to say they would be having a child. A few months after Angelica hit one year old, Melinda went into labor. Charles Crandall Finster Jr. was born on April 13, 1989. Melinda was overjoyed at her healthy son, and we set up play dates between Charles, nicknamed Chuckie, and Angelica. These went over very well. Seeing my daughter grow up with close to a normal life made me feel hopeful that the visits to the neurologist wouldn't be necessary soon. And they weren't.

About half a year after Chuckie was born, the neurologist told me that he saw no need in seeing Angelica once a month anymore and recommended a once a year approach instead. Everything was going smoothly, another friend of the family, the DeVille's, were pregnant now too. Betty DeVille never did an ultrasound to discover what gender her baby was, as she wanted it to be a surprise. Because of that, we never really knew if Betty's baby was a boy or girl. But I am getting way ahead of myself.

We continued to bring Angelica to Melinda and Chaz's house to play with Chuckie. She seemed so happy. The two of them would get into fights every once in a while, but they were young, and it happens. The only thing that mattered was that she was acting like a normal child. This wouldn't last forever.

A few months before Chuckie's first birthday, Melinda got sick, very sick. She was admitted to the local hospital, where she stayed for the rest of her life. Chaz and Chuckie would go and visit her just about every day. I didn't bring Angelica to visit as often.  In fact, we eventually had to stop altogether. Angelica was so upset when I told her we wouldn't be visiting for a while.

“But why?” She asked one night before bed. It had been earlier that day when I had informed her that we wouldn't be visiting for a while. She had apparently been thinking about it all day. Her confusion and sadness had finally come out just after I had finished bathing her. Her eyes started to tear up.  

“Because Chuckie's mom is sick, Pumpkin.” I replied, sitting down on her bed, picking her up and sitting her next to me. A single tear rolled down her recently cleaned cheek. I reached over and wiped it off.

“S-sick?” More tears had started to fall. She seemed more upset at the fact she wouldn't be able to visit her little friend rather than the fact that his mother was sick.

“Yes, Mrs. Finster is very sick. That is why she was taken to the hospital.” I replied. Snot started to dribble from her nose as the tears continued to fall. She sniffed and wiped her nose with her sleeve.

“The hopital?” She asked, getting the word incorrect in that adorable way young children sometimes do.

“Yes, sweetheart, the hospital. She is being looked after by doctors. They will ensure that she gets better soon, okay? Then we can start going over to Chuckie's again, okay Princess?” I lied about Melinda getting better soon. Her illness was terminal. She would spend the rest of her life in that hospital. That just isn't something you can tell your two year old child. She sniffed again and started to wipe the tears from her eyes.

“Promise?” She asked, the tear streaks shining on her face.

“Of course, Angel.” I reached over and hugged her. Afterward I wiped the tears from her face. “So stop crying, okay?”

“Okay daddy.” She said, tears no longer streaking down her face. Her nose was still a little runny though. I got up to turn the light out when she called back out to me. “Daddy!” She called. I turned back to look at her. She was still sitting on the edge of her bed, in her pajamas. Her face was still shining from the tears.

“What is it?” I asked. Her eyes started to tear up again.

“I love you.” She said. One last tear traveled down her cheek. I walked back to her and picked her up, hugging her again.

“I love you too Angelica,” I said, still hugging her. “And I always will.” I put her into bed and tucked her in. I gave her a kiss and walked toward the door, turning out her light and plugging in her night light.  I left her room and walked to my study, where I sat in silence for a few hours. It was past midnight when the door opened.

“Drew?” The voice pierced the silence, nearly startling me. It was Charlotte. I was slightly taken aback. It had been some time since we had talked in private. She had been cold and distant to me. I knew it was because of Angelica. You see, Charlotte wasn't a bad person, she just had a lot of pride. Before Angelica came into the picture, Charlotte and I tried our damnedest to have children. It never worked. We never found out if we were just unlucky, if she was infertile, or if it was my fault. Well, I suppose it wasn't my fault, Angelica proved that.

From the moment I got custody of Angelica, Charlotte never warmed up to the infant. I think the fact that she never was able to have a daughter of her own stung. She started spending most of her time on the phone with her assistant, Johnathon, trying to close deals at that Merge Corp she worked at. She poured all her energy into that job of hers. At night she would fall asleep almost instantly, without even talking to me. The worst was that she was cold and distant to Angelica too. I could tell by Angelica's expression when Charlotte talked to her, or didn't rather, that this hurt her. I tried talking to Charlotte, but to no avail.

She walked across the room to my desk, where I was sitting. She turned around and leaned against the desk, looking at me. For a brief moment I thought I saw concern in her eyes, but she quickly looked away. “What are you doing in here?” She asked sternly, “It is after midnight.”

“I know Charlotte, it's just... I am worried about Angelica.” I said. I sensed her stiffen when I mentioned Angelica. She crossed her arms, a frown forming on her face. I looked back to my desk. “Melinda Finster is in terminal condition, she isn't going to last long. I told Angelica that Melinda would be just fine and she could start visiting Chuckie again very soon. Do you think it was wrong of me to lie to her Charlotte?” I spoke quickly, telling her what had been bothering me the past few hours. Charlotte sighed and looked at me again. This time I saw a hint of pity.

“She is a child, Drew. What would you have said? 'Sorry sweet cheeks, but your little friend's mother is about to die.' You did the best you could under the circumstances.” When I still looked down, she sighed heavier, and crossed her arms again. “Besides, this wouldn't be the first time you lied to a girl.” I looked at her, confusion on my face.

“Charlotte, what are you talking about?” I asked, staring at her, “Who have I lied to?”

“Jesus Drew,” She said loudly, swelling up, “I am talking about me. What was it you said in those wedding vows? That you would give me your deepest love and your fullest devotion! And now... now some bastard child comes into your life and-”

“Charlotte, she is my daughter!” I interrupted. I stood up from my chair without thinking and started yelling. “I helped bring her into this world, and she is my responsibility. If you are mad at me for spending more time with her, fine! But do not take it out on her. She is just a child. And don't call her a-”

“Daddy?” Angelica was at the door. Charlotte and I had woke her up. Tears were streaming down her face once again. Charlotte took this opportunity to recompose herself and storm out of the study, pushing past Angelica. I silently cursed Charlotte when I saw the sad and confused look on Angelica's face as she watched her leave. “Why were you guys yelling?” She asked, her lip trembling slightly as she continued to cry. I walked over to her, knelt down, and put my hand on her shoulder. I used my other hand to wipe her tears away.

“Angelica, sweetheart, mommy and daddy were just having a little disagreement. It happens sometimes with grownups. Don’t worry about us, we will be just fine. We just need to get you back to bed, okay?” She sniffed again and nodded her head. I picked her up and carried her back to her room. I placed her back into bed and tucked her in. I kissed her on her forehead. “Goodnight Angelica, daddy loves you.” I said softly, before walking towards the door.

“Daddy,” She called out, just like earlier that night. I looked at her to see the most pitiful looking expression on her face. “W…were you fighting because of me?” The bottom of my stomach felt like it dropped out. Had she heard what we were arguing about? I gulped and went back to her bed, sat on the edge of it, and looked into her eyes.  

“Angelica,” I said, taking hold of one of her small hands, “Mommy and Daddy both love you very much. We also love each other very much. There is nothing you can do to make us not love you or each other. Now get some sleep, okay?” She nodded and closed her eyes. I kissed her one more time and walked out of the room. That night I tossed and turned restlessly on the couch. I had no desire to lay next to Charlotte. My mind kept turning to Cynthia White.

This Sunday, it was me. A normal night. My coworker left at 8, and I began cleaning in preparation for the close. The store was empty. Or at least I thought it was. Because when I walked back out to the front after finishing the dishes, there was a man sitting in the farthest booth, the one with only one bench that faces the windows. All I could see was the back of his head, covered with short, non-descript brown hair. I couldn’t fathom that I hadn’t seen him come in, or at least heard the chime of the door when he entered. I decided he must have come in before Cora left, when I was distracted, and then must have gone to the bathroom or something. It was also strange how he was simply sitting there, not ordering a sandwich or making a phone call or anything. But I shrugged it off. He was probably just waiting for something or someone.

At least that’s what I thought then. But he’s been sitting there, unmoving, staring out the window for the last 45 minutes. And I’ve discovered something worse. He doesn’t show up on the security cameras. When  I first walked to the back and glanced up at the monitoring screens, I was simply puzzled at how he could have snuck both in and out without me noticing. But then when I walked back out, there he was. Staring. Waiting. 

A customer came in. He didn’t see the man. Looked right past like he wasn’t there, on both his way in and his way out. And I know he would have stopped or at least stared had he seen the man. I know because when I was at the far end of the counter, I saw his face for the first time, reflected in the window. Well, what should have been his face. He was almost featureless, his skin smooth and pale. But I said almost featureless. He had eyes. Set low on his head, and far apart. Big and round, with black irises surrounded by white. 

He was watching me. I could see it. Watching my reflection as I moved behind the counter. 

I haven’t done anything I need to for the close. I don’t want to go out there. I’ve tried to call several of my friends and coworkers, hoping someone will come and keep me company. They aren’t answering their phones.
I’m sitting far back behind the counter now, just out of sight of the lobby. Here I can see him, but he- hopefully- can’t see me. My friends still are not answering their phones. No one is. The internet isn’t working.

I know what he’s waiting for now.

I didn’t see the man in the last booth come in, and I’m beginning to fear I won’t see him leave.

After a year of this life, you have almost given up hope of making any friends, be it at work or any other means. You feel very lonely.

You never see anyone else eat there either, ever. The place is perfect for you. 

Making love to her becomes a routine. You go there every night for dinner and then to see her. 

You eventually make other friends, and eat at the diner less and less. After some time, you stop going completely. 

At a bar with your best friend, you tell him about the fun you had with the waitress at the diner. He says he absolutely must see her. You take him there one night, but the building is in a state of ruin. The front door barely opens. The grimy insides of the diner are disgusting, and behind the counter is a moldy corpse, reeking of pus and rot. 

When the police come to the scene, they interview both you and your friend. You are shocked to hear that the body is of a runaway girl from another province.

""Look ma, she was all alone, can I keep her?"", she asked with big eyes. Meggy took a closer look at the doll and pulled the string on her back. ""seven - seven - seven ..."", that was the only thing the doll could say. She took it to the checkout and asked the cashier about it. ""Hm they can usually count from one to ten, I can offer you 50% off in this case"". ""Seven is my lucky number!"", said Amily happily, so they took it home.  

They next day when Meggy called for dinner, Amily didn't reply. ""Amily?"", she asked again while nearing her room. Again no reply. When she opened the door she couldn't believe her eyes. Amily just layed there, frozen, with a pale face, holding the doll in her right hand. No one ever found out what happened to Meggy's doughter.

She thinks of everything in her life, and how there's nothing in her life that matches the film she watches. Sometimes it's a comedy, sometimes it's a thriller, and on the rare occasion, an Erotic film. She always had a problem with outright porn, but if it's a steamy film where tension and passion played before her, she could handle the sex scenes well enough. But as long as the romance is there, she enjoys whatever is before her. Which most would consider a shame, because she is of the mindset that there really isn't that much to her life.

She's a pretty girl. She's 23, she's got a business degree, works at a local credit union. She's got full blonde hair, eyes like the color of the sky in the early morning, and blessed with looks that don't need makeup. If she matched her features, she would be a bright, cheery, outgoing person. The world would go out of it's way for her, just for the subtle warmth of her smile. But she only smiles politely, and her eyes hide clouds that she just can't seem to clear away. An interminable sadness that shaded every friendship, every suitor's attempts, and every single joy she could have had. She chooses to remain hidden, because she feels that's the only thing in her life that is real.

As she finishes her meal around 7:22, she quickly washes her dishes, with the film playing loudly to cover the sounds of her tears as they get washed down the drain. A meal is meant for more than one person, she tells herself, and no one would love her enough to break bread with her. More tears fall, as she realizes how hard she is on herself, and that just drives the feelings deeper into her heart. She finishes her scant few dishes, and rushes back to the TV. She curls herself into a ball, covers herself with a blanket, turns on a light, and finishes whatever film she's watching.

By 8:20, the film usually finishes, and with a groan, she lifts herself out of her seat, and proceeds to her bedroom in her apartment, quickly changes into her exercise clothes, grabs her iPod filled to the brim with somber sonatas, and longing arias and ballads, and begins to run around the block until 9:35. By 9:39, she has stripped herself, and started to prepare her bath, hot as it can get, but just before pain meets her godliness. When she climbs in, she plays more songs of romance and loss, sets the timer on her phone, and lies in the tub, pondering what to do with her sense of despair and longing.

She closes her eyes, and imagines the sight of her father's body, flensed open, intestines and other organs lovingly piled onto the floor, to make room for her mother's head, and the corpse of her sister, positioned in a way to promote a sense of violation by their father. And with each stroke of the loofah, she tries desperately to wash away the images that she knows will haunt her for the rest of her life. The sense of revulsion, still present in her mind after five years of cleaning and isolation. The taste of her bile, rising in her throat with each reminder that she could do nothing to help them otherwise. The pain in her heart, that wells up in her throat with each choking sob. And when the timer goes off at 10:16, she opens her eyes, sees the bleeding marks where she scrubbed too hard and too long, rinses herself with the shower head, and proceeds to get dressed.

At 10:34, she heads to the kitchen for her ritualistic pre-bedtime snack of popcorn and cocoa, goes to the living room, pops in another film, usually something lighter hearted than what was played earlier, and slowly spends her time attempting to forget her life. But every time she begins to lose herself to something she enjoys, the flashes of her family's bodies, splayed out on her bed, rushes to her mind's eye, and spoils the mood she thought to allow herself some respite in. When she finds herself finished with her snack midway through the film, she rushes to wash the dishes, hurries to her seat, wraps up in her blanket, and finishes the film at 12:15, even sitting through the credits.

By 12:26, she has changed her clothes, turned off all the lights, locked every door and window, heads to her bedroom, and programs her charging phone to set off an alarm to wake her at 7:30 AM. Then she climbs into bed, and stares at the ceiling, with only one image burning into her brain. The image of words, written in blood, above the corpses of her loved ones, in large, unmistakable letters, that has robbed her of any sense of love or feeling of connection for 5 years.

I LOVE YOU, DIANE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

It's been 5 years since that day, and she spends every last waking moment counting the days towards her birthday, and every moment of that day in fear and isolation. She believes that whoever did this will appear again, and the next time they do, it will be at her cost, and more of a display than what happened to her parents. Then, she rolls onto her right side, counts the change of the day, and by 1:00 AM, closes her eyes, and falls asleep.

Another day of a beauty trapped in her own tower, afraid of the Prince that will come for her. And I smile to myself, as I longingly stare at her through the window as she sleeps, like I do every night for over 5 years. Her birthday is in a couple days.

It's 5:35 AM and there's not much I can do. You know what the worst part about my situation is? I'm in the same room with my parents. They keep looking at me, and I can't help but look back and try not to cry or scream. Their eyes are focused on me and their mouths are wide open. There's the strong scent of blood and I feel paralyzed with fear.

Here's the ehting, the second i make any hint that I'm not asleep anymore, I'm completely fucked. I will die and there's nobody around to save me. I've been trying ot think of a way out but the only idea I have is to rush for the door and run outside the front door and scream for help, hoping my neighbors hear me. It's risky, but if i stay here, I'll surely die. He's waiting for me to wake up and see his masterpiece.

You're probably wondering what's going on, I get ahead of myself sometimes.

About three hours ago, I heard screaming from the other side of the hosue, I got up and went to check on the noise before realizing I had to use the restroom, instead of doing the smart thing and investigating, I used the bathroom first. I could've gotten myself killed right then from my stupid actions. But I actually did my business and took a peek outside the bathroom. There was blood on the carpet. I got very worried and ran back to my rom, hiding under my sheets like the pussy I was. I tried to convince myself to go back to sleep, that it was just some really vivid dream or soemthing.

But I heard the bathroom door open. Like the terrified child I was, I peeked from under my blankets to see what was going on. I could see something dragging my dead parents into the room. It was not human, I can tel you that. It was hairless, with no eyes and no clothing, it walked like a caveman, with its back slouched as it dragged my parents. But this thing was much smarter than any caveman. It was aware of what it was doing.

It propped my dad up on the edge of my bed, and made him face me. It then sat my mother down in the chair and positioned her towards me as well. It then started rubbing its hands upon the wall, staining them with blood and then drew a circle with the devil's pentagram on it. This thing had made what it probably would call a masterpiece. To finish it off, it scribbled a message onto the wal that I could not read in the darkness.

It then positioned itself under my bed, waiting to strike.

The scariest thing now, my eyes have adjusted to the darkness since then and I can read the message on the wall. I don't want to look at it, because it's terrifying to think about. But I feel I need to see, before I'm killed.

I peek at the creature's masterpiece.

The other players would have to wait; he had to pee. With his shoes safely attached to his feet he walked to the door and stepped out into the hall of his dorm. Jefferson Hall had not received much of the renovation money that Kline University had put towards improving the older buildings, but it was far from the worst hall to reside in. That title would have to go to Calvin Hall. It was the ghetto of the campus. The hall he walked into was painted a sickly white color most people would associate with older buildings; its high sheen almost made the walls look wet. His shoes clopped along on the old linoleum, sounding very much like a horse.

Moving down the hall Quincy could almost feel himself growing wet; not because of his need to urinate, but because of how humid the building was. Not only was it steam heated during the winter, but his room was only a short ways away from the shared bathroom. Whenever anyone took a shower the humidity level rose to that of a jungle. With the current level of humidity someone was surely showering. His suspicions were confirmed when he rounded the corner into the dimly lit bathroom and heard a shower running. 

Being a shared bathroom with almost thirty college level men, the place was a wreck. The sinks were filled with hair from jocks shaving their heads, the faucets were covered in regurgitated tooth paste, and the whole bathroom smelled of piss. The stifling humidity caused by the showers only amplified it. Washing your hands almost seemed like a waste, not that the Neanderthals Quincy lived with would do that anyway. Not even a rinse most times. The yellow light cast by the fluorescents in the ceiling was the piece de resistance to this dystopian like bathroom. 

Stepping up to one of the two pube ridden urinals, Quincy unzipped his fly and set to business. The guy in the shower whistled tunelessly and Quincy could hear someone rustling around in one of the stalls to his right. He hoped this wouldn’t take long. By the time he got back to his computer he would probably have been disconnected from the server he was playing on. Administrators for the games he played seldom waited for those that were “away from keyboard”.

He was just about finished with his business when one of the men to his right spoke. It sounded like nothing to Quincy at first, probably just cursing at dropping the soap. Yet he continued to say things, sounding more alarmed by the second. Quincy zipped up his jeans and stepped back from the urinal, its auto-flush taking away what he had brought. Slightly curious about shower man, but not enough so to investigate, Quincy walk back towards the hair covered sinks. With little warning, the man in the shower began screaming at the top of his lungs. 

Quincy stopped halfway to the sinks, startled, but still not concerned. Living with a bunch of immature “men” he’d become used to their nonsensical screaming long ago. This one seemed off, however. The scream kept on for a few seconds then was abruptly cut off by a very loud, wet, smack. It reminded Quincy of the times he and his brothers would take their rotten Halloween pumpkins and smash them on their driveway. With his curiosity aptly piqued, he walked back to take a look around the stalls. The scream had come from the shower at the end, but he couldn’t see anything from where he was standing.

By now, the man in the stall had given up on his mission and was ready to leave. The stall door burst open and a red faced, red haired guy came barreling out. He didn’t look too happy about the screaming. He looked to Quincy accusingly. Quincy simply shrugged and nodded towards the shower. The red head guy walked over to the shower the scream had come from, looking like he meant to kick someone’s ass. He ripped the curtain back, but didn’t like what he saw. His face quickly drained of all color and he stepped back from the shower.

“What is it?” Quincy asked. He had clearly seen more than just a naked guy. The red head stammered to say something, couldn’t, and ran back to his stall. Now slightly concerned, Quincy walked toward the shower to see what was in there. He heard the red head heaving in the toilet. Genuinely perplexed now, he pulled back the first shower curtain.

The showers were set up so that there were two areas. The first had a curtain separating it from the outside and a curtain separating it from the actual shower. Quincy liked to call this the staging area. It was fully tiled and had a towel hook on one side. Beyond the staging area and the second curtain was the actual shower. The showers were not very ergonomically designed; barely large enough to move around in and the shower heads put out enough water pressure to fight fires. What should have been a white plastic floor with drain was now jaundice yellow from years of sweaty feet trampling it.

The staging area had flecks of blood and what had to be skin hanging from the ceiling, slowly dripping to the floor. The second shower curtain was pulled down and on top of the bare legs of the shower man, who now sat down on the floor of the shower. His legs were pale and limp where Quincy could see then. The upper half of his body, however, was gone; still in the shower, just no longer attached to him. The walls and ceiling were coated with gore, bone, blood, and bits of hair. What must have been part of his scalp was now hanging off of the shower head.

Quincy did not know what to do with what he was seeing. He saw it, recognized it for what it was, but couldn’t comprehend what to do. Nothing seemed like a valid response; not even heaving his parmesan chicken and noodles into the toilet like the red head. He didn’t even know who the man was who had simply exploded like someone over eagerly pushing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom up.

He heard something from his right that snapped him back to reality. It was a ticking noise, almost like the sound a Geiger counter would make when exposed to a mildly radioactive substance. It was loud, but not intense. He wasn’t the only one that could hear it, it seemed. The red head stuck his head out of the stall he was in, looking to Quincy to see if he heard it too.

“What the hell happened to him? What’s that noise? What’s happening?” The red head stammered with a bit of bile running down his chin.

“He popped,” was all Quincy could think of to say. His voice sounded strangely calm to him. It was bound to get shaky before too long. 

“Is he dead?” 

“Yeah,” Quincy couldn’t blame him for being incredulous. He could hardly believe what was happening either. “Do you hear that ticking?”

He stopped to listen for a second. “Yeah, what is it?”

“I don’t know. It started after…”

The ticking started to grow more intense seemingly at the mention of it. What was once a hard to hear tick was now becoming much louder and more intense. The Geiger counter was getting closer to some much nastier stuff.

“We should leave, find the RA,” Quincy suggested. I must be in shock. No way I should be handling this so well, he reasoned. 

“Right, right,” the red head responded. “He’ll know what to do.”

The red head took the lead as they both quickly made for the exit. As they rounded the urinals and came into sight of the mirrors and sinks along the wall, the red head stopped. Quincy couldn’t see what was the matter at first, but looking at the mirror made that clear. The ticking was up to a roar by now and the thing in the mirror might know what it was about. Quincy only had a brief glimpse of it before it ducked below where they could see it, but what he saw killed whatever shock was dulling him before. 

What looked like the body of a jackal with a human face stood on its hind legs and watched them in the mirror, quickly darting down once they saw it. The reflection had been directly behind Quincy’s head. It was behind him. 

Fight or flight took over with flight winning. Quincy pushed against the red head to get him moving. He didn’t need much encouragement to make a rush for the door. Somehow managing to not trip over each other they made it through the doorway and back into the bathroom. No, no, no, we just left here. This can’t be real! Red head realized the same and tried to turn around to leave again. Quincy got in his way so he shoved him aside looking out for number one. Quincy was not a very physical guy and red head was. Tripping over himself, Quincy cracked his head on one of the sinks and everything went black. 

His eyes opened back up. His face felt stuck to whatever he was laying on. Bolts of pain ran through his head as Quincy tried to put together where he was and why his head hurt so badly. Peeling his face off the sticky floor he took in his surroundings; still in the bathroom. Maybe he had simply smacked his head and all of that was a concussion fueled nightmare. Only seeing a black and white blur for a second he pushed himself up and took in his surroundings. 

He certainly was in the bathroom. The smell and humidity assured him of that. No matter how many blows to the head he took he’d always recognize that smell. Touching the side of his head he could feel blood running down a scrape on his forehead. He almost wiped it on his pants then remembered there was the paper towel dispenser. Incredible that no one came in here while I was out. It’s not even past nine yet. With another burst of stars he pushed himself up and made for the towels

As his head cleared he saw the jackal sitting on the other end of the room watching him with eyes too big for its “human” face. Though the disemboweled corpse of the redhead sat next to it in a pool of blood it bore no look of malice towards Quincy. It only watched him, seemingly curious as to what he was doing. Quincy, however, was not as curious. Forgetting about the towels he ran for the door only to find it closed and locked. Pulling with all of his might he could not force it. Tears had started to build in his eyes. Had he not already gone to the bathroom he would have soiled himself.

The ticking began again. Quincy pounded on the door, screaming for help. How could no one hear him? There were almost thirty damn people on his floor. Why the hell could no one hear him? He glanced back over his shoulder to see if it had moved closer. It had. No longer sitting on the far end it had stood up and started to walk towards him. More furiously that before Quincy pounded on the door, pushing his lungs to their limit as he screamed for someone, anyone, to help him. It pawed his shoulder. 

Quincy ducked down and ran back towards the showers. There was nowhere to run to, not even anywhere decent to hide, but it was the only place he could go. As he slipped around the corner, almost falling again, the stench of decay hit him. The stalls and showers were gone. The ceiling was gone. The walls had been replaced with bloated, rotten corpses. Where the ceiling had once been was now a crimson red sky, full of billowing black smoke. What had started as a trip to the bathroom had become a journey to a land of nightmares. Crazily he thought, I’ve surely been booted by the admin by now.

His grip on sanity was shaking now. Dropping to his knees all he could do was wait for the jackal to come for him next. Within seconds, the jackal was behind him, running his paws over Quincy’s shoulders. The air was no longer humid, but incredibly dry. Quincy could feel incredible heat, not only from the outside, but from the inside of his chest. The ticking was louder than ever, drowning out all other noise. He could feel the jackal leaning in closer to him, putting its face up to his ear. His quickly breaking mind did nothing to try to stop it, nothing to force his legs to run, his arms to fight.

With a raspy voice, the jackal told Quincy, “You are mine, now.”

During my junior year of college, I was given the opportunity to study Chinese for one year at one of the top universities in China, Xi’an Jiaotong University. It was a great opportunity for me because my minor in college is Chinese, so I figured it would be a great way to improve my spoken Chinese.
I began my language classes at the beginning of September, 2012. After a couple of weeks of studying, I really began to realize that in order to become a fluent Chinese speaker, I needed to make lots of Chinese friends. I made lots of friends, but I became particularly close to one girl named Ying Ying. We had a lot in common: movies, books, TV shows, and music artists; it was surprising how many similar interests we had.
However, the most notable interest that we both shared was a fascination with the supernatural. Ying Ying was a devout Buddhist, and she believed that she had a hypersensitivity to the spiritual. She claimed that the spirit that visited her the most was the spirit of her dead grandmother. Sometimes she would tell me that she couldn’t hang out because her dead grandmother told her that she needed to study; other times it was things like, “I can’t go out tonight, because my grandmother told me last night that if I go out tonight, I’ll die.” I didn’t really believe in any of that stuff- my interest in that sort of thing is just for fun, but Ying really believed in all of that.
I met Ying Ying at the beginning of October, 2012.
One day we were in a coffee shop discussing these types of things, and she brought up an old Chinese custom that was completely new to me. “Have you ever heard of the death marriage?” she asked.
“No, what’s that?”
“It’s an old Chinese custom. If a family had a son that died, before the son’s funeral, the parents would hold a wedding ceremony for their son, so that they would have a wife in the afterlife.” She told me
“Well that’s not so weird. Lots of cultures had women who volunteered to be killed for a dead man.” I mentioned Scandinavia and India, but apparently, this practice was a little different.
“These girls weren’t volunteers.” She explained. “The parents of the sons would often find dead girls, or even pay people to kill girls for their sons.”
“That’s freaky shit! Was this legal?” This freaked me out.
“Well it was… frowned upon, but it didn’t really become illegal until the end of the Tang Dynasty. There was an incident, right here in Xi’an.”
“You’re shitting me.”
“I shit you not.” She told me. She then started telling me the legend of how it became illegal. “During the Tang Dynasty, Xi’an was the capital. There was a girl living in the city named Huang Lei. Huang Lei was supposedly the most beautiful girl in Xi’an. At the same time, there was an army officer living in the city named Yang Sen. He was the son of a wealthy family, and he was one of the imperial army’s most promising officers. Well, one day, Yang Sen was out on patrol with his soldiers, when a snake spooked his horse. He was thrown from the horse, and he snapped his neck.”
“Wow that must have been embarrassing.” I mocked.
“Shut up! I’m not done. Anyways, he was a young man, and he was unmarried. Before his funeral his parents hired a witch named Nu Wu to kill a girl for her son to marry. The first girl that came to Nu Wu’s mind was Huang Lei.”
“Wait a sec, pause. The witch’s name was witch (in Chinese Nv3 Wu1 means witch)?” I was starting to think that this story was complete bullshit.
“This is story is where we get our word for witch. Now shut the hell up and let me finish! Anyways, the witch brutally murdered Huang Lei, and sold her corpse to the family of Yang Sen. The family then held a death marriage ceremony and a funeral for both of them. One week later, the witch was found nailed to a wall in her home and her head was sitting in the window. Yang Sen’s parents were found dead the next day; they’d been killed in the same fashion. However, some of the servants said that they saw Yang Sen and Huang Lei, walking and holding hands, in the house the night before. Vengeful spirit rumors spread through the city like wildfire, so the emperor officially declared the practice to be illegal. Some people say that the spirits of this dead couple still wander the streets of Xi’an.”
For me, this was a fun story, but I figured that for Ying, this was the uncut version of the city’s history. “So, do you actually believe this story? I mean, you’re you and all.”
She looked at me with kind of “you dumb-ass” look on her face and said, “Of course I believe it! Vengeful spirits exist!”
I wasn’t really convinced so I just smiled agreeably and nodded my head. She had a right to believe what she wanted. Besides, the more adamant she was about her beliefs, the more interesting she would be to talk to.
A few days later, we decided visit Chang An, the old part of Xi’an. Neither of us had ever been there before, so it would be something new for both of us. We visited the area around Da Yan Ta (Giant Wild Goose Pagoda). While we were walking, Ying stopped and was silent for a long time. She was looking straight ahead, but I couldn’t see anything. She was terrified of something, there was no mistaking it, but I had no idea what. She began to tremble; then she began to cry. By this point I was getting uncomfortable. “Ying, what’s wrong?” I asked.
She didn’t look at me. She just said “Can’t you see them?”
“See who, Ying?”
Without looking at me, she grabbed my face and pointed it straight ahead of us. That’s when I saw them; it was a man and a woman wearing Tang Dynasty Era clothing. They were looking straight at us, just… staring. The man was dressed like a soldier, he even had a sword. The longer I looked at them, the more I realized that there was something way off about these two, more than just the fact that they were dressed in traditional Chinese clothes. The man’s face was expressionless, but the woman’s face was horrible. There was an unmistakable fury in her face, and she was pointing at Ying. When she saw that I was staring at her, she drew the man’s sword from his sheath and pointed it directly at me.
That’s when Ying let go of my face and ran. She didn’t stop, and she didn’t look back. I turned back around, and I didn’t see anything. Well that was creepy as hell, I thought; then I turned around and ran after Ying.
That happened in early November, 2012.
The nightmares began about a week after that. At first they were just nightmares about the story that Ying told me. I didn’t really lose too much sleep over them, so I wasn’t too concerned. When I tried to ask Ying about what we saw or talk about the dreams I was having, she would just say, “Let’s not talk about that,” and she’d change the subject.
When December, 2012 came, the dreams became increasingly worse. There were several times when my roommate would wake me up in the middle of the night, complaining that I was screaming in my sleep. Every night I had the same dream. I dreamed that the couple came into my dorm room, and the man nailed my roommate and I to the wall next to our beds. The woman would then take the sword out of his sheath, and stab us to death. 
The night terrors began the first week of December, 2012.
I was having this dream every night. The worst part about these dreams was that I didn’t wake up right before the woman began stabbing me. I felt every bit of it, as if I were actually awake. It was excruciating, and it was happening to me every night.
Because of this damn dream, I was only sleeping about three or four hours per night. I was preparing for exams, so this was a really bad situation. After a couple of weeks with this sleep pattern, I think I started to hallucinate. I began seeing the couple in the corner of my eye, at the end of a large crowd, in shadows, and sometimes I’d even see my teachers as the woman. I decided that when Christmas break came, I was going back to the US. I hadn’t been planning on returning home until August, but I figured that a vacation would be healthy.
That’s when I found out that, in China, apparently they don’t have Christmas break. First semester in China lasted until January 1st, so I wasn’t getting a break until then. What was even worse was that I had exams the week of Christmas. On top of that, I was being tormented every night by the same night terror. 
The dreams didn’t stop. My grades suffered, and so did my roommate’s. My exam scores were dangerously low, so I was in danger of losing my scholarship. This needed to stop. I met Ying one last time before she returned home for the break. I had to discuss this with her; maybe she could help me stop the dreams and the hallucinations. At first when I tried to talk to her about the dreams, as usual, she tried to change the subject, but this time I didn’t take no for an answer.
“Cao ni ma! Don’t you dare change the subject this time! I’m having night terrors every night; I can’t sleep! Hell, even my roommate can’t sleep! I almost completely failed all of my exams! Tell me what the hell is going on!” I demanded.
Ying hesitated; she kept looking to her left, next to our booth. A really fearful look began to emerge on her face. “They’re here right now.” She said. “They’re next to our booth. I’m not coming back to Xi’an. Classes ended yesterday, so I’m leaving tonight. I’ve been having the same dreams. I can’t take this anymore. I’m just so scared something’s going to happen. You should leave too.”
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I figured that extremely realistic night terrors were possible, and there was no way these were actual ghosts. The ghosts I was seeing were just hallucinations. I was still in denial. “I don’t believe this. There’s no way that these are actual ghosts. I don’t believe in that bullshit. I’m not going to run away from an opportunity like this just because of a few bad dreams.” 
Ying began crying. She was so horrified. She knew exactly what was going on. Now I realize that she was right. She grabbed my face and turned it to my right. That’s when I saw them. They were standing right at the end of my booth, looking down on us. Their eyes were black, and they were both speaking an older form of Chinese that I couldn’t understand. 
I screamed and jerked free of Ying’s hands. Everyone in the coffee shot turned and looked me like I was crazy. Only now I knew that I wasn’t crazy. Ghosts were real, and two of them were following us. Ying was right; I needed to get the hell out of China.
We left the coffee shop immediately. Ying went with me to my dorm to help me pack. We went to the airport together, and she helped me buy a ticket for the next flight to America. We waited together for a long time. She told me that she thought that they wouldn’t be able to follow us, because they were tied to Xi’an, but she wasn’t sure. I was hoping, praying, that she was right. My flight was first so I left.
That was January 2nd, 2013.
When I returned to America, I called my friend and asked to stay at his place. I had the first good night’s sleep in what felt like years. I actually slept for 36 hours peacefully. The dreams had stopped.
I woke up on January 6th, 2013.
When I awoke, I turned on my friend’s computer and logged onto my QQ account (Chinese social networking site). I wanted to see if Ying had gotten home safely and had gotten any sleep.
“Hey is everything back to normal?” I asked. After several minutes, she sent me a link to an article in the Xi’an newspaper.
“You need to read this.”
I read the article. The article was about several murders in our university. The victims were her roommates and my roommate. I was mortified. I felt responsible. We should’ve warned them about our dreams. What was worse was that there were pictures of the killings. Our roommates were nailed to the walls next to their beds, and their insides had been ripped from their torsos. Above all of them, the Chinese characters “你在哪儿” were written in blood. In English this phrase means, “Where are you?”

     That's what I thought happened when I met Emerson Clark. He was tall, he was handsome, he was sweet, and I got to be very close to him. For a while, I was pretty sure Emerson and I were going to get married. I would be Mrs. Clark, we'd have sweet, well-behaved children, we'd live in a cute little cabin on the outskirts of a pretty town, and we'd live happily ever after. 

     That was in high school when I thought that. Things became very different when we graduated and moved into an apartment together.

     Much to my surprise, Emerson did not ask for my hand in marriage the instant we were all moved in. He was suddenly not so open with me; instead of deep, thoughtful conversations like we had before, he'd give me monosyllabic answers to everything I asked him. ""How are you feeling?"" ""Fine."" That was his favorite. ""Fine."" He said it all the time. We were on our own, we were financially unstable, and I had just received three refusal letters from colleges I had applied to, but everything was just ""fine."" 

     As weeks turned into months and years, our relationship became more like that of a hateful couple that was together only for the children and less like the loving couple we were in high school. We didn't have kids. We had to move into a shoebox apartment. We fought constantly. Living with Emerson became like living with a ticking time bomb; it would only be a matter of time before one of us popped. He had become so secretive with me that I hardly even knew who he was anymore. We were now in our thirties, unmarried, and hating each other. I missed high school. I missed my family. I missed our old relationship. But there was no way to rewind time. We were adults now, and if that meant staying together just so that we can keep the apartment, that's what it meant.

     ""Em, what do you want for dinner?""

     ""Ham.""

     ""We can't afford ham, Em. Pick something else.""

     Emerson glared at me. I knew what it meant. It meant I'd have to go get a ham. It didn't matter that we were dirt poor in a shitty apartment and that it'd only put us another twenty eight bucks into debt, Emerson wanted ham, and if I didn't get it, something bad would happen. I sighed, grabbed the same purse I had been using since high school, and headed out the door. Once I was in the car, I checked my wallet. Emerson had taken my cash. I went to the ATM and withdrew twenty eight dollars. Surprisingly, I didn't get the usual ""insufficient funds"" pop-up. Maybe Emerson had finally gotten a paycheck. I headed to the grocery store, bought the cheapest ham I could find, and quickly returned home. If I did anything else, Emerson would know. He watches me.

     I walked up to our apartment and open the door, setting the ham down on the counter.

     ""Change?""

     ""There wasn't any."" I replied. ""Ham is expensive.""

     ""Gimme the receipt.""

     I handed it to him. He scanned it over, brow furrowed, before crumpling it up and throwing it on the floor. Emerson didn't say anything else. He wouldn't. I unwrapped the ham, set it in a baking pan, slid it in the oven, and let it cook.

     Between me putting the ham in the oven and whatever else was on Emerson's mind, we got in another fight. This time, there were fists, and only his own. Blood- my blood- dripped to the ground from my shattered nose and jaw as I lay on the dirty carpet, hoping Emerson would go to bed. He didn't. By the time I no longer felt his knuckles embedded in my face and stomach, both of my eyes were swollen shut. One of my newly broken teeth pierced through my lip and tongue. I felt a tear in my ear as I heard Emerson snatch his coat from the couch and stormed out the door.

     ""You'll regret doing that, you little skank.""

     The door slammed shut. I was alone. I felt my way to the kitchen and opened the oven door. The ham was burned. I wept.

      ---

     The next morning, I awoke with a thirst for revenge. I got into my car. Em had broken the windows and stolen most everything in there. I didn't care. I knew he watched me, but, little did he know, I watched him, too. I didn't know exactly where he went, but I didn't need that piece of information. I drove to a familiar building, parked, and walked inside.

     Other people were there, too. My employees. This was one part of my life Emerson did not know about, and I made damn sure of that. The ground level floor fell silent as I stepped in the front door, dried blood still caked on my face. I strode past them, to the stairwell, and continued downstairs. The basement was cold and dark. I flipped the lights on, and a thousand creatures simultaneously flinched and yelped.

     People were chained to the walls as far as my eyes could see. The basement extended far, far beyond the property lines and contained a great deal of the grimy town I lived in. Naked bodies, with jutting ribs and hips, tried to crawl away from the light. My products. The scrawnier ones could be sold into sex trafficking, but the ones with more meat on them had far more uses. Sex slaves, free labor, and if they were uncooperative, they would be butchered and sold as pig or cow meat. People other than my own employees were down here; probably pimps, looking for new material. A curvy woman dressed in satin selected a scrawny young man from the multitude. An employee nodded, hung a ""sold"" sign around the man's neck, and accepted a small wad of cash from the woman. The man would be fed until he was at a healthy weight and then delivered to his new master. As he was unchained from the wall and  taken to a prep room, I looked at the sign above where he had laid.

ALEXANDER YIMM

     I scratched it out, and wrote a new name down.

EMERSON CLARK

    My employees found him, no problem. He was chained to the wall within an hour of me writing his name down. Most of the people I harvested were random people off the streets, but I was sure to keep a special place in the basement for those who did me wrong. I walked over to him, and smiled coyly.

     ""K-Kelly, what is this place!?""

     He was panicked. I loved it. I did not say another word to him. I just smiled. I would be the one regretting it, he said? I don't think so. I'd be fine. I leaned forward and hung a sign around his neck.

1337276888.0,47,self.creepypasta,tryb4,Creepy Pokémon Blue...,RubberBallsAndLiquor,55,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/tryb4/creepy_pokémon_blue/,"I want to tell you something that happened to me. It happened some time ago, but I haven't told anyone since, but recently it has been playing on my mind. It's quite a long story, but worth it. I just need to write it down to get it off my chest. It's all true, I promise. I just want to tell you it.

It all started about two years ago. I was at a Pokémon convention in my town. I have always loved the gamand TV shows since I was young, and although my interest had waned in recent years, I had decided to go to the convention as it was free entry and I had an itch to play again. With my old GameBoy Color in hand, I left for the convention.

It was a gorgeous sunny day. Sure, I felt a bit dorky going to the convention. What if everyone there was ten years younger than me? To my surprise, the majority of people were at least fifteen. It was fun to see a bit of nostalgia, and to re-live my youth. Looking through my Pokémon Red file from fourteen years ago brought back so many great memories - stupid nicknames I had given Pokémon and just the great lengths I had gone to trying to collect all Pokémon and complete the game.

I thought I would try and battle some people. Sure, I hadn't played the game in a while, but it would be fun. I entered a place where people were battling, and felt lost amongst the Nintendo DSs, but there was a corner where people were battling old-style. I battled a few and got my ass kicked every time. There were some I nearly won, but these people were obsessed, and far better trainers than I was. I still had fun, though, and was nearly going to leave, when I came across a kid, maybe only twelve years old, who looked pale, frail, and was bald, with an old Pokémon cap on. He was very reserved and was waiting for someone to battle. I pulled up a stool and introduced myself. ""I'm Kevin"", he said. We shook hands, and decided to battle. He plugged in the cable to connect our GameBoys, and away we went. He was very good, and clearly played the game a lot. His team was pretty vanilla - a Dugtrio, Gengar, Marowak, Farfetch'd, and another two that I can't remember. He was clearly an amazing player, and his Gengar single-handedly wiped most of my Pokémon out. But we kept battling for about an hour, chatting, laughing, and generally having a nice time talking about Pokémon. He reminded me a little of myself when I was his age; very reserved and quiet, but genuine and nice once you cracked the shell. He was keen to trade Pokémon, and help me acquire some that were required for me to complete my Pokédex. He traded me a Graveller and a Haunter among others. After I while, I decided I'd leave, and I shook his limp hand again, and said goodbye. When I left, he gave me this look that I hadn't seen the whole time we'd been playing. It was a look of terrible sadness in his eyes, yet an almost blank expression on his face, that was almost mesmerising. After a few seconds, my mind jolted and I let go of his hand, said an awkward goodbye, and left. As I left the area, I looked back, and the kid was still looking at me from afar. I was overcome with chills, and walked home.

I had decided after the fun I had that day at the convention that I would get back into Pokémon again, and try and complete the Pokédex I had worked so hard on when I was younger. There were only a few more to catch, and most didn't seem hard to get, just some levelling needed to be done. For some reason, I couldn't get that kid out of my head. It was something about the look he gave me when I left. Whenever I thought about it, I got chills, and the feeling of death came upon me. Although I had began this new task enthusiastically, I soon grew bored of levelling Pokémon, and I had a lot of exams I needed to be doing for college. A few months passed by, and I had not thought about Pokémon Blue for weeks, until a local newspaper suddenly brought everything back to me.

I was doing my daily routine of buying coffee and a newspaper, and reading the local news in my area. There was nothing too interesting, and as I was about to finish and leave Starbucks, I caught something in one of the back pages. This was the obituary section, and there is sometimes a picture of the person deceased. I could now see a grainy picture of the kid I met at the convention, and a small paragraph about his passing due to an ongoing battle with cancer. Having not thought about this kid for a while, I was shocked, and although I had only met him once, he seemed nice and I was genuinely saddened. That's why he looked so frail, I thought.

It sort of ruined my day, but I was determined to play Pokémon again. It was late after classes when I came back to my apartment, and after relaxing, I decided to turn on the GameBoy Color. It started normally enough, and as the intro with Gengar and Jigglypuff came up, I remembered the fun I had at the convention with Kevin, and how he whooped me with his Gengar. I felt like I would complete my Pokédex for him, aa a way of remembering him. This was when weird stuff started happening.

My game was getting pretty glitchy. Certain things were happening, small things, but noticeable. Some wild Pokémon had the wrong cries, and the music would miss certain parts. The glitches got worse the more I played. After a while, Pokémon's colors would change and the text started breaking, looking almost unrecognisable. I started getting creeped out. NPCs would say the wrong things, or were incapable of being interacted with. Sometimes my character would take a step forward when I didn't even touch the GameBoy. It felt like I was being watched the whole time. I didn't like this at all. I decided to turn the GameBoy off, and go to bed. I couldn't sleep much that night, and I started seeing Pokémon in my dreams, with their slow cries that seemed unexplainably creepy and sinister.

The next day, I figured the cartridge was probably just dirty and needed a clean. Afterall, I hadn't played it in a few months. When I got back from school that evening, I tried to take the cartridge out, but it was literally wedged in. The thing was stuck and wasn't moving anywhere. In my struggles to try and pull the cartridge out, my hand budged the switch, and the GameBoy turned on. The familiar intro wasn't even there. The titles came straight up, although there was no music. The Pokémon that come on and off the screen next to Blue in the intro, I noticed, was a loop of my current roster. Charizard, Vileplume, Beedrill, Aerodactyl, Persian and Snorlax. This was bizarre. I was overcome with chills, but it was almost like I couldn't let go of the GameBoy. I was fixated, and could only continue my adventure.

The game was almost unplayably glitchy. I was in Vermillion City, but the edges of the screen were glitchy, with squiggles and smudges and crazy colors distorting the landscape. What was going on? Every few steps I would take, a random Pokémon would appear, with running away impossible. My Pokémon were taking quite a beating from these wild Pokémon that kept appearing from nowhere. The music was frightening. It was a distorted mixture of high frequencies and low, ominous undertones. I would try and walk into a building, but the text would come up ""This way is locked. Try again soon."" I am sure that this text was never in the original game. What the Hell was happening to me and my game? I was beginning to get sucked into it. Every move against my Pokémon felt like it was damaging me, inside.

Suddenly, the game started to make clear noises amongst the hideous 'music'. It was the poison sound, out of nowhere. Krzp, krzp, krzp. I paused the game and looked at my roster. My Snorlax was poisoned! Every time it lost HP, I could feel it inside of me. It felt like something was eating my very soul. I had to get to the PokéCenter. I tried, but still that sign came up again - ""This way is locked. Try again soon."" What does that even mean? When can I enter? The glitches meant I couldn't access my bag. I couldn't even pause the game anymore. I could hear the poison sound inside my head and it was louder than ever - krzp, krzp, krzp. I could feel myself sweating.

""Snorlax died.""

What!? Snorlax died? Pokémon faint, but they don't die. The feeling of being watched overcame me. I had to fight my way out of this game. How could I not let go? I couldn't even take my eyes off the small screen. Everything around it was dark. I had to escape somehow.

""GENGAR used TELEPORT.""

I don't even have a Gengar! Why was it using teleport? Why was all this happening? The screen faded to black, and then I was in Lavender Town. I could hear and feel that ominous music through the screeches of the previous glitchy music, so now the music was even more chilling. What's happening to me? I tried to enter the houses, but the usual message appeared. I tried the Pokécentre. I could enter! This was a small success. When I walked to the desk, the Nurse was facing the back wall, so I couldn't see her face. When I tapped 'A', she turned around, but the sprite was hideous. It was distorted and had red spots under the eyes, as if they were bleeding, and her mouth was wide open. As she turned around, the GameBoy made the highest-pitched, loudest noise yet, as if the Nurse was screaming.

This scream snapped me out of my trance. I was so startled that the GameBoy left my hand, and when it did, it turned off. I sat on the couch in a tired disbelief. What the Hell just happened? What is this? Why is it happening to me? All these thoughts spun around my head as I passed out and the dark room turned to black.

Mrs. Stone smiled faintly and waved as she headed back to her apartment. He grabbed a large paper sack out of the trunk and carried it over to the recycling bin. This was a daily ritual for him, ever since he saw the cleaning crew in the office dump the recycling bin in with the rest of the trash.
 
Jim jogged up the stairwell to his apartment. He was getting home late as usual from a long day at the office. The job always came first, or at least that was always the excuse he used for still being single. As he approached his door, he spotted a package on his doorstep and grinned. If there was anything more satisfying to him than his job, it was writing reviews for his blog.
 
The box was large, but very light. Jim grinned from ear to ear as he carried it in, excited to see what kind of product had been sent his way this time. There was no telling information on the outside of the box, just a standard mailing label with a return address somewhere in South America. Upon opening the box he found a large fluffy pillow and a short letter. The letter explained that The Gusano Corperation was looking for popular bloggers to promote their line of pillows. They were Hand crafted from 100% organic materials using renewable resources.
 
Jim scooped up the pillow and fluffed it in his hands. It was light and soft; whoever had woven the cloth was certainly a master of their trade. He couldn't wait to blog about this. He set the pillow aside and tossed the box over by the recycling bin then went straight for his laptop. He made a quick entry thanking his readers for spreading the word about his blog and promising to review the pillow after a good night’s sleep.
 
After responding to a few e-mails and a quick meal, he decided to settle in to bed early. He flopped his old pillow on the floor and put the new one in it's place. As he settled into bed, he couldn't help but start thinking of the adjectives he'd use in his review. Slowly he began to drift off only to be snapped back to consciousness by a faint scratching noise. That rodent problem must have come back he thought to himself. He made a mental note to pick up some humane traps tomorrow and turned to settle back in, then drifted off to sleep.
 
A wave of pain shot through his body and he rolled out of bed crashing to the floor. The sound of scratching and clawing was deafening. He grabbed at his ear and felt the hot viscous liquid pouring from it. He could feel something burrowing deeper into his flesh. He scraped and tore at it, but the gnawing continued to echo in his head until he collapsed.
 
The next day a glowing review was posted. Soon all his fans would have a pillow just like his.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_t915r,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/t915r/pillow/,

Some may consider it a nightmare. I just thought I’d leave this here for you guys to see since I’ve never really told anyone about it. This is how it happened.
        I was watching this dream in third person. I wasn’t in it and I didn’t know the people in it. A boy(about 5-6years old) and his dad were out in the front yard of their house. It was so normal at this point. They were playing catch with a football. Back and forth the football traveled. I sat in third person and watched this for a while. To them, I was non-existent. After a while, the father threw the football a little too hard and hit the boy in the head. At 5-6, he was upset and started crying and ran inside the house.
	The father, I imagine, felt pretty bad about hitting his kid in the head with the football and chased after his kid. My third person view, followed the father, not the kid. It looked as if I was floating above and behind the father. As the father ran inside, he heard the kid crying pretty closely. At this point in time, every thing got darker and more ominous. The mood changed very quickly. It didn’t feel very good. But, the dream continued. As the father walked around the corner, he saw his kid, with a revolver in his hand pointed toward his head. As soon as he made eye contact with his father, the little kid.. Shot himself.. In the head.. It was the worst sound I’ve ever heard..

It brought me the feeling of warmth and the remembrance of my childhood, you know, simple things that yet bring such joy into your body to fuel the rest of your day. However, this particular morning, the sun brought me a burden, something that changed life the way I knew it. I arose from my slumber, groggy and uncoordinated, about ready to hit the bathroom to wash my face, but something held me back. Not literally, but I just felt something odd. I saw something flinch at the window and automatically, my attention followed the sudden movement. I was still a little woozy, but I could've swore I saw two little, bloodsmeard and severed hands, sitting at the sill of the widow. They were pale, and missing fingernails, they looked like children's hands. I rubbed at my eyes furiously, feeling the anxiousness and fear build up. I was hoping it was just my conscious mind playing little tricks on me, but they rested there, like stones. My breathing suddenly quickened as the cold objects pounced at my body and fastened a tight grip around my throat, squeezing out a scream from which I could never imagine me making, directly from the depths of my despair. I got up on my shaken feet and started convulsing, as I could feel the small hands sprouting nails that dug deep into my sweat covered neck. I could feel my soul escaping from my body as the nails inserted some sort of poison. My vision started going wavy and my head felt like it was blowing up like a balloon, just waiting for someone to prick it with a needle, ending my life. Then, the blackness intruded my brain, cornering all source of light. I already knew I was gone, I could sense it. But I woke up somewhere strange. I wasn't in my house, my office even a grocery store. I was at somebodies window sill. All I could see were my hands, and they were drenched in fresh blood, nails removed, and frozen. I didn't know why I was there but as soon as the little boy in the room awakened, it all became clear and it was like someone flipped a switch in my brain.

I’ll tell you now, since you are so persistent, how I got this scar on my hand. As a boy, I used to play in the woods near my home. In the winter months the grass and dirt were a kind of sepia sand color, and only darkened towards the color of the skeleton trees as snow began to melt. Our closest neighbor lived maybe three miles away, and was a good friend of mine. When our parents permitted it, we would visit by bicycle and play in that dense forest that wrapped heavily around both of our little houses. We spent hours together daily during our Christmas holiday. My friend was my age- eleven- and had a thin tuft of chestnut hair and ruddy cheeks. He was chubby like me, and his mother always made him wear gloves. We made a game of swordplay using brittle branches. We parried, riposted, ducked, and weaved our way into a myth each day, and returned for supper as the day turned orange. 

One day, in the midst of such nonsense, we became lost. We hadn’t noticed how far we’d gone until a draw was met, and we had to sit to catch our breath. “Which way his home?” he asked, snow falling from his mouth. We often ate snow. I glanced about, hoping for a familiar boulder or deadfall. I wasn’t worried, and chose a direction at random. “This way, I think,” said I, taking off at a terrific pace. With my friend close on my heels, I unknowingly led us deeper into that wood, and further from the safety and warmth of my mother’s hearth.

Children either panic too early or too late. An adult usually knows when panic is appropriate, a trait that I dearly wish I had prematurely developed. As the sun’s fire blazed through the branches and that golden hue suffocated and blinded us, I panicked too late. My hands were wet and cold through my gloves and I knew that soon it would be dark. Twig-sword in my hand I began to ask my friend plaintively where we were, knowing that the blame fell squarely on my young shoulders. 

We decided that it would be best to change directions, which was useless because we had turned about a great deal since we’d set out on our daily adventure. Eventually, the sun began to fade. With that slow death of day came the frigid caress of a winter night. My friend began to yell. He yelled at me, he yelled for his mother, he yelled for his father, and he yelled to be heard. To be heard would have been a glorious thing indeed. To be heard would mean some hope to two young boys- to be heard would mean that we were not alone. 

He became enraged. Depending on your age, an enraged eleven year old may seem a trifling matter, even endearing. To another eleven year old it seems quite scary (especially when you are certain that you will freeze and meet Peter with blue lips.) It had become just dark enough so that a tree might seem some twisted foe when a red crack sent a flash of pain across my face. I cried out with surprise, and it wasn’t until the second angry line appeared that I realized what was happening. My friend had turned on me with his stick-sword. The anger that bubbled through me was threefold. Firstly, I had been attacked by a friend and was hurt by that. Secondly, he was only compounding our problems. Last came the fear-anger that we all know. Charging into a dark room bellowing like a wounded bull is much easier than tiptoeing in. 

I returned the assault, slashing wildly. I had removed my playful restraint and was swinging with all my might. Then, a sound fell upon me. These dark woods were quiet at night, and it was night now. The sound was a wet crunch, much like one is used to hearing when a slushy snowball strikes a fence. I was frightened, and ended my assault abruptly. I turned and yelled fiercely: “Who’s there? Who’s there?” I called to my friend, who didn’t answer me. He must still be cross because I’d laid into him so ferociously. Having spun about so quickly, I fell down. I landed on some deadfall, but it was soft. My hand was in something warm. I know today that it was the head of my friend, split open on a piece of sharp rock protruding from the ground, but it took me a great deal of time to understand, since I hadn’t felt his jacket until a few seconds later. In such a situation, those seconds seem like hours. 

My god. He was dead. I’d killed my best and closest friend. I hadn’t meant to, that much was obvious; but- He had begun to groan. He whimpered feebly, and began to cough violently. I couldn’t help him. In a few long minutes, he was truly dead. Shuddering with sobs, disgust, fury, and shame, I fumbled for his legs. I couldn’t leave him here; I had to take him home with me. They could fix him, I was sure of it. I’d only drug him deeper and deeper into those woods though, and when the first tickling sprites of dawn showed me the redness of his wound I began to vomit. When I was done, I lay face down next to what was once my best friend. I was still lost, and had given myself up for dead as well. A noise then, another rarity in these woods that I had begun to dread like the reaper himself. The sound was like whittling- a rasping, shuddering yet quick little breath. He was alive. He was still alive. I hadn’t before, but I wished death on him now since we wouldn’t be found. At the same time, I had to try to save him. Not knowing my business, I rolled him over and stared at him dumbly. How does one treat such a horrifying injury? His head was covered with brown spider webs of coagulated blood. I touched his face, crying freezing tears that stung my cheeks as they went slowly down towards my dry lips. My fingers went over his eyes, nose, and mouth. When they reached his bottom lip, a pain ignited in my hand that caused me to scream and recoil. He’d bitten me! I was trying to save his life and the little snot had BITTEN me. In my fury I hit him back, right across the mouth. I think that’s what killed him.

I grab my phone and wince at the bright screen. 

2 PM. Damn. 

I don’t think I will ever have a regular sleep schedule. I lay in bed contemplating. Should I get up? Or say fuck it? Today is almost over, and no one has tried to get a hold of me. No one will know, and only I will think I’m a piece of shit. No, I should get up, maybe take a walk.

*Fuck that.*

“I know, but I have to at least let some people know I’m still alive.” 

I stretch and get out of bed. I take a few steps toward my desk before turning back and looking at my bed. Why does it have to look so warm and comfortable? No, Tim, no. Now is not the time for sleeping.

*Now is the perfect time for sleeping!*

“Shut up,” I say out loud.

*You know, most people listen to the voice inside their head.*

“Yeah, but you’re an asshole and I don’t like you,” I respond to the voice.

*Fair enough.*

I push the little devil on my shoulder to the back of my mind and browse the internet for a little while before I decide to get ready for the day. I take a shower, brush my teeth, and put on some cologne. 

*What are you doing all of this for? No one gives a shit.*

I don’t reply. I don’t need to have this conversation with myself. My self-esteem is already in the shitter. I don’t need that asshole making it worse.

*Ignoring me? Tch, fine.*

I leave my studio apartment to go get food. I should learn to cook, and actually keep food in the place. I wouldn’t have to go out so much. I walk to the closest convenience store and buy some frozen food and soda.

“This should get me through to tomorrow,” I say to myself.

*Frozen burritos again? Yuuuum.*

“I’m being sarcastic with myself now? Jesus, I need to find some friends.”

*Friends? You have me!* 

Ha. Ha ha. At least I can make myself laugh. Pathetic as that sounds.

I make it back to my apartment, open the door and step inside.

“I’m home,” I say out loud.

*Gasp, welcome home!*

I let out a sigh and close the door.

*You know, our life would be so much more interesting if you let me take the wheel.*

“I’m not letting you kill innocent people.”

*Bah. I just think you hate having fun.*

“Killing is illegal.”

*HAVING FUN IS ILLEGAL!?*

I let out a laugh, and head towards the kitchen. It’s kind of messy. I should probably clean it after eating.

*Nope.*

“Yeah, nope.” I finish eating and head to my computer.

“What are your plans for tonight, Tim?” I say out loud. 

“Same thing I do every night, try to take over the world, by staying inside and browsing the internet!” I answer.

*Nerd!*

“Whatever.” 

I wonder what’s new with Reddit. I open my internet browser and browse the Reddit front page. One thread catches my eye immediately, it’s an ask Reddit thread about casual encounters on Craig’s list. I read through it a bit. 

*Interesting.*

“There are people who are just as lonely as me posting for hook-ups on the internet? This is interesting. How have I not heard of this before?”

*Maybe because it kind of pathetic?*

“It couldn’t hurt to look. I mean, according to the comments on Reddit I probably won’t find the most attractive women on here. But, it has been a while.”

*Dude.*

“I know. Don’t worry; I doubt anything will come of this. After all, I’m a shut in. And I’m pretty sure I’m a loser even compared to Craig’s list standard.”

*Attaboy.*

Hours pass as I look at all of the ads. Most of the women are looking for specific things, and of course I don’t match any of them. I’m a six foot tall nerd sitting in a dark apartment trying to find a woman to hook up with online. Nothing about me particular stands out. I have short brown hair, brown eyes, and a goatee and, well, a body that needs to see a gym. I have nothing else to do though, so I refresh the page.

An ad appears at the top of the list, Looking for a “fat and unattractive nerd” for some fun.

*“Fat and unattractive,” eh?*

Why is that part in quotation marks? I open the ad. It has pictures.

*Hooooly shit!*

Yeah, she’s beautiful. She has smooth alabaster skin, grey eyes, dark make-up, bright red lipstick, and dark red long curly hair. Her description says she is five feet and five inches tall. She has a fantastic body. How would I describe it without sounding like a pig?

*Tiny waist, great legs, nice hips, and huge… tracts of land. She’s kind of perfect actually.*

“Yeah, she’s too perfect. She could have any guy she wanted, why the hell would she post on craig’s list? There has to be something wrong here, the description of the type of guy is pretty much me.”

*I bet it’s a dude.*

“Yeah, but what if it’s really her?”

*Nope, it’s a dude and he’s going to try to rape and kill us.*

“Stop being a pessimist. Look, I’m going to reply. What’s the worst that can happen? I show up, she’s not who she claims to be and I leave. At most I’m just wasting my time, something I have plenty of.”

*Or we show up and a fat hairy dude jumps out and takes a knife to our chest and we die. That’s a fucked up ending if you ask me.*

“Too late, I already sent the reply.”

*Our penis is going to get us killed.*

“Whoa, that was quick. She already replied.”

*Well don’t leave the readers hanging. What does it say?*

“It’s an address and a phone number. In my reply I asked her to send me a picture with her touching her nose so I know she’s not a fake.”

*And?*

“She sent the picture.”

*So... Why are we still here?*

I quickly get ready and leave my apartment. I jump in to my car and punch the address in to my GPS. Fifteen minutes away, I’ll be there in no time. 

I pull up to the house. It’s an old Victorian style two story house. The outside of the house is run down and needs some fixing up; a new paint job wouldn’t hurt either as the current paint is chipping away. There is only one light on in the window.

*Uhh... Remember that bit where I said we were going to die?*

“Shut up, I need this.”

I pull out my phone and dial the phone number provided in the email. 

A soft and very seductive voice answers on the other line, “Hello?”

“H-Hi, T-this is T-Tim. I answered you’re a-ad on Craig’s list,” I stutter nervously.

“Are you here, Tim?” She asks in a breathy tone.

*Holy shit, that voice.*

“Y-yeah, I’m outside in my c-car,” I’m still nervous.

The door opens and she steps out on to the porch wearing only black lacy lingerie and beckons me inside, “come inside, Tim.”

*Dude…*

“O-okay,” my voice is still quivering.

My eyes have not left her since she stepped outside. I hang up the phone, and exit my car. I make my way towards her. When I reach the top of the porch she smiles, turns around and enters the dark house. I follow her inside and am greeted by a dark hallway with a light about halfway down. I walk towards the light and enter the room. She’s there.

The room is a very spacious living room, although it lacks decoration. There is a desk with an old computer, a coffee table, a couch which she is sitting on with two end tables on both sides, and a television. This place looks significantly better on the inside than it does on the outside.

She pats the cushion next to her, “come, sit.”

I obey and sit next her. She looks me deep in the eyes and I can’t look away. She brings her face in close to mine.

“You thirsty?” She asks, “Would you like something to drink?”

This snaps me out of my haze for second, “Huh? Oh, y-yeah, sure.”

She gets up to leave and grab the drinks. My eyes are on her the whole time. When she reaches the threshold she turns and looks at me.

“Take off your clothes,” she says and exits the room.

Her voice is so seductive. I can’t help but do what she says. I take off all of my clothes and sit back down on the couch. I am very aroused from the sound of her voice and what she is wearing.

*Is this really happening?*

She returns with two beers and notices that I’m aroused and smiles. She sets the beers down on the coffee table and stands in front of me. She slowly kneels down and puts her hands on my thighs and rubs my thighs and chest. I start breathing heavy; my nerves seemed to have calmed down as my body starts to get warm.

*I cannot believe this is* ***actually*** *happening.*

I keep my eyes on her. She starts to kiss me on my thighs and moves her way up. She leans up and kisses me on the mouth. The kiss is long, and breathe taking. Like something you would see in a romance movie. She then makes her way down again and takes my manhood in her hands. She looks up at me and looks deep in to my eyes.

*Heaven.*

She takes me in to her mouth. My eyes roll in to the back of my head and I lean back as pure ecstasy over takes my body. I feel like I’m on drugs. I can’t keep my eyes open because everything is blurred and moving fast. I don’t mind though I enjoy the sensation. I look down at her, there’s a glint and I close my eyes again.

*Dude.*

“Shut up.”

*DUDE!!!*

“What the hell, man?”

*SHE HAS A FUCKING KNIFE!*

What? My eyes shoot open and I look down at her. Sure enough she’s brandishing a knife and smiling.

“What the f-“ is all I could let out before the knife plunged in to my stomach.

My vision goes dark. I can hear the knife sinking in to my stomach several times. I can hear her laughing as she keeps stabbing me. I don’t feel any pain, only coldness. I feel my hands reach for my stomach and feel the warmth of the blood.

*Why is it so dark and cold?*

“Am… Am I dying?” There is an echo inside my head.

“H-hello?”

Nothing.

“Did… did I just die?”

No response.

Fuck.

I’ve been a long time reader of creepypasta/supernatural stuff and always half-wished something like that would happen to me. It just did. I haven’t bothered to tell many people because...well, what am I gonna say? People don’t even believe me when I say that I think chocolate is overrated. 

I go to University in The Maritimes. To help pay for rent and excessive drinking I got a part-time job doing campus security. I got the short end of the stick when signing up for shifts and got stuck with the 0400-0800 Monday which sucked until I got used to waking up at 3AM. Honestly, I’ve actually gotten used to it; I do a couple rounds of the campus, write down any damage or irregularities, and then spend the rest of my time on my computer shitposting on anonymous message boards.

Part of the reason that these shifts are empty is also because the ambiance of the school at night freaks people out. The campus is pretty old and has burned down twice so it has a lot of old foundation that it’s built upon. Because of the structural instability of a lot of the old rooms, a good portion of the school is closed off. One of the things I really enjoy about my work is that I occasionally have reason to explore these sections...it fills me with a secret joy to see the “guts” of the building.

Anyway, so I woke up at 3am as usual so I can make my way to work for 4. East coast weather is usually cold, gray, and rainy this time of year. Tonight was no exception. When I arrived on campus to relieve the other two workers at the time (we take shifts in twos), they told me that I was going to have fun this shift.
“The pump is broken, you’re going to need to go down there and manually turn it on and off.”

What the fuck is ‘the pump’? 

Apparently, due to the nature of the foundations of the building, it was necessary for a pump system to be put into place to drain off excess water and dump it somewhere else to prevent flooding. The pump room was a section of the school I had never had any reason to go to before, so in a way I was kind of excited to get to explore it.
One of the workers showed me to the room which located at the front of the campus by the library. It was down a flight of stairs that I had never noticed before despite it being in plain sight. It’s weird how the human mind is able to gloss over things like that when it’s not looking for them (like that figure that you just saw move from the corner of your eye). I digress.

“You’ve really gotta struggle with this lock, it’s pretty finicky,” she said as we stood in the small pool of water that had collected at the base of the stairs. 

Finally she got the door open and we stepped into the pump room. Most light switches are dinky little things that you just ‘click’ to turn on, however the one in this room was a heavy lever style one which flipped with a satisfying ‘clunk’. The lights in the room shuddered to life and began to hum quietly, occasionally flickering. It makes sense that this room would be fairly low on the priorities list for maintenance considering how it’s mostly automated.

http://i.imgur.com/ankTEUC.jpg

One of the first things that struck me was how incredibly cold it was in there. Usually coming in out of the rain makes one feel a bit chilly at first, but this place...shivers.  Other than that, it was a standard industrial room with high ceilings, concrete walls, rusty pipes, and a bunch of rubber tubes. The second thing I noticed was that at the end of the room was a basin with dimensions comparably to a living room sofa.

http://i.imgur.com/bbN3VUy.jpg

“Wow, where does this thing go?”

“No idea, it’s pretty deep. Here,” she said, handing me a long pipe that was propped against the wall. I shoved it into the water, yet couldn’t find the bottom. I turned on the flashlight on my phone yet still couldn’t see very far past the surface. Wherever the basin led to it didn’t seem like light could reach it. 

“The basin fills with water from the campus through that rusty pipe on the side there. Flip that switch to drain the water levels and wait about 5 minutes for it to reach that line. Then, flip it again. Don’t let it drop below the line or it’ll flood the library.  Come back after an hour to drain the water otherwise it’ll flood this room and damage the pipes.”

We locked up the room and left.  She went home and I went back to the office. 

An hour later, it was time to drain the pumps. My co-worker, Dubs (we use code names over the walkie-talkies, I’m using them here too) didn’t know how the pump room worked and since explaining it to him would involve him coming with me, I volunteered to do it by myself. If you’re reading this story, you know this was a BAD IDEA.

It was still raining when I made my way over to the pump room. I opened the door, reached over the water basin, and flipped on the switch. The pipes rattled in disagreeable tones and the water level began to drop. I leaned against the wall with nothing to do but wait. It was eerily silent except for the gentle sound of running water. I looked over at the basin and began to zone out. There’s an expression that if you stare long enough at the abyss, it begins to stare back at you. I thought it was funny that there were two faint pale circles in the water. I moved a bit closer to see if I could figure out what they were.

And then they blinked.

I screamed and stumbled back, bolting towards the door. Behind me I heard a violent splashing sound like something was emerging from the black pool. I slammed the door shut and hastily shoved the key into the lock, driving into the door with all of my body weight. Due to my fear and adrenaline, I can’t say whether I was imagining it or whether something was pushing back against the door. Finally I managed to get the door locked and I breathed a momentary sigh of relief...until I realized that the pump was still on.

It was raining harder now and I was standing ankle deep in a puddle outside of an underused maintenance room. Leaning against the heavy metal door, I began to weigh my options: did I really want to be known as the guy who flooded the library basement? I wanted to keep my job. I reasoned that I didn’t even see anything definite and that I was just psyching myself out.

“I’ll give it another minute. Hopefully whatever’s in there, if there is anything in there, will be gone and I can run in, flip the switch, and run out.”

So I waited, shivering, in the rain.

After enough time had passed, I put the key in the lock. I was shaking so hard that I was afraid my skeleton would jump out. I turned the lock and waited

Nothing.

So I opened the door a crack and looked inside.

Nothing again.

I flung open the door, rushed at the panel, and slammed the switch down. Behind me, towards the door, I heard a commotion of something knocking over the tubes and pipes. I turned and saw it.
It was a gaunt and skulking figure, hunched on all fours and roughly the size of a dog. The skin was rubbery and translucent white with limbs that were not quite claws and not quite fins but some ungodly combination of the two. Tendrils, gills, jutting vertebrae. It was an evolutionary accident. A biological impossibility. The thing flailed and scurried out of the door. I stood paralyzed.

I waited again.

The sound of pounding rain somehow soothed me as I stood intensely watching the blackness of the door, the lights of the pump room still flickering. I mustered up the courage to run out, slam the door behind me, and sprint towards the office.

When I got back inside I was soaking wet, freezing cold, and terrified out of my fucking skull.

“Dude, something spooked me in the pump room”

Dubs laughed and teased me about it. There is nothing as terrible as someone not believing you, especially when you can hardly believe it yourself. 

“Ahaha, alright little buddy, I can hold your hand if you want. We need to do an external anyways.”

An external round is essentially a check of the perimeter of the campus. We look for broken windows, graffiti, dead bodies, etc. As usual, we started at the back of the building by the garbage disposal to come around to the front where the library and pump room are. Still on edge, I was comforted slightly by the presence of another human being. I pushed open the back door and beheld that it was absolutely pouring rain. Like, real torrential stuff here, I could hardly see. I put the hood up on my coat and walked out the back door to the garbage disposal with my co-worker behind me. 

http://i.imgur.com/dq6GLXW.jpg?1

I squinted to try and see through darkness with the water pouring over my face, struggling to make out the shapes of the area. My eyes were drawn to a figure moving in the corner beside a dumpster. In a stupor, I moved closer and my blood turned to ice in my veins. It was that fucking thing. It was digging through the trash. 

I backed up and realized that the door was closed.

“Where the fuck is Dubs?!” I pulled on the door. 

Locked.

The thing noticed me and turned what I can only assume was its head in my direction.

I began to pound on the door behind me, my eyes still fixated on this vague shape as it crawled towards me. As I peered into those pale circles that stood out like otherworldly moons I knew that its intent was to cause me harm.

The door opened and I slipped inside backwards as fast as possible, slamming the door in front of me. Even though the door locks automatically I pulled on the handle with all my weight, desperate that this thing wouldn’t come inside.

“Whoaaa buddy, I stop for 5 seconds and you freak out on me?”

“W-we can’t use this door.”

He laughed and told me to step aside. He opened it and, surprise, there was nothing there. In many ways that was what I was afraid of most. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to tell this to anyone; that I would be alone in this horror.

I’m still shaken up by the whole thing, Dubs teased me about it for the rest of the shift. Nothing else eventful happened that night, we operated the pumps as usual.  I’ve considered telling people about it, but what the fuck do I say? Do I tell them that something came out of the basin? I have no evidence whatsoever and honestly, I’d rather just forget it and move on. 

I’m not sure I’ll be able to do that though.

That thing is still out there.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1365002209.0,,,True,t3_1bgion,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1bgion/the_pump/,

You might not find this scary, but I can assure you that I felt pure horror when this happened.

Let's begin by enstablishing the fact that I'm an atheist. I don't believe in an almighty god or a Jesus Christ who posessed supernatural powers. I hope that this won't stir up talk of whether there is a god or not in the comments, as I am not denying the existance of one, I just don't believe it. This is my personal opinion. Anyway, this happened about a year ago when I was having trouble falling asleep. I was just looking up at the ceiling, thinking about various things (like the possibilities of time-travel and jumping between different universes, that kind of shit) and suddenly, I thought about a concept that defied all that I had been taught: what does hell look like, and what is its purpose? I created mental images of spikes, fire and suffering, just like how the western culture has pictured hell to be. But it all felt so silly to me. Why would there be fire or spikes, things you find in our world? Why not something that humans can't even begin to describe? Wouldn't that be more fit for a realm of chaos? Thinking about these things, I fell asleep.

In the dream, I woke up in a room I have never seen before. It looked like a room you might find in an old cottage in the woods. I sat up on the edge of the bed, and before me stood a demon of some kind. It was small, like a child, but it had black, crooked horns and a tail. He said with an adult voice: ''So, I guess you had some questions to ask.'' It startled me to see a child speak with such a low voice, but I asked him a question: ''What is hell?'' He smiled like he had known what I was about to ask. ''Follow me, I will show you.'' Now, I'm a relatively smart guy, I knew this could never happen in real life and I knew I was dreaming, but I was still a bit nervous about following him. I stood up, and walked out of the room, through the door he had opened for me. There was a light and the next time I saw something, I was somewhere else. It was another room, but not one you would find on earth. I knew where I was. It was hell. The walls were some kind of white, almost transparent tissue, stretched to its limit. I felt sick, it was like the room itself was suffering and shivering beneath my feet.

I just stood there for a while, looking around me. There were demons like the one that had brought me there, just looking at me and holding some sort of poles up in the air. Then, I felt something rip through my intestine and exit through my mouth. It was a spear. I gasped for air, but felt my lungs leak it out when I did. The spear had impaled me and I was unable to tilt my head up or down. I felt my feet come off the ground as I was lifted up, suspended on the spear, like the others that I now saw. Those devils were holding people up on spears, just like the one that was holding me. There were hundreds of people there, children, elders, all kinds of people. And all of them were sobbing, some were trying to reach others around them, flailing their arms in a disgusting manner. I could turn my head just enough to see new people being brought in, just like me. Some fell to their knees before being impaled. Some just stood in awe.

I was panicking. Was this really hell? Had I died? What was going on here, and why were all these people being tortured? I couldn't speak, as my tongue was pinned down by the spear, but I think my demon heard my thoughts, because he let me down. ''They are what powers the world. They burn so that others can be born.'' I heard him, but could not focus my mind enough to really think about what he had said. My lungs were aching, full of blood that I was desperately coughing out. ''Why am I here!?'' I screamed with a pathetic, broken voice. He smiled and answered: ''You wanted to know. And all you had to do was ask.'' I stood up and he pointed the spear he was holding at me. ''Time to go back up. Can't keep the mistress waiting.'' I was crying and backing away in despair. ''Good!'' he said. ''The ones willing to escape last longer! The ones who give up just rot away for eternity.'' I turned around and started running. The other demons didn't seem to mind me getting away, and just stood there watching. I saw some holes in a nearby flesh wall, and decided to jump into one.

It was wet and dark, like a tunnel made of dead meat. It was cold, too. This tissue wasn't pulsing like the one that room was made of. I crawled for a long time, and finally saw some light. I exited into another room of flesh walls. This time, no demons or suffering people. I was relieved. But then I saw something that scared me more than those little demons I had seen earlier. It was a woman with the lower body of a spider. It was holding something in its hands. It was a baby. The monster looked at the baby for a while, examining it. I noticed a pile of babies next to that monstrous thing. A pile of motionless, pale, dead human babies. I felt like throwing up. All I wanted was to get away from this place, but how? Another hole opened on the other side of the room. It was my way out, I was sure.

I started slowly creeping closer to the spider lady, and I noticed that there was another hole, this time on the ground next to her. I wondered where that hole led, and heard the voice of that demon in my head: ''That direction is for the unfit children. It leads to the chamber of our mistress, where they are raised to be like us. These children come from your world you see. They are the ones that are not wanted, and are brought down here. Sometimes we let them back up though, to be given another chance.'' I was listening to his words and it made me think about something: Was I not wanted? Is this why I was sent down here?

I finally got to the hole, and jumped in without looking back. I was back at the door which I had gone through in the first place, and my body was intact. No blood in my lungs, nothing. It was like that whole thing had never happened. Then I heard that demon's voice: ''You got your answers. I hope you are satisfied. Come see me again sometime. All you have to do is ask.''

After waking up with a jolt, the girl laid in bed a few seconds longer. Reaching over to switch on her bedside lamp, she tried to remember exactly what had stolen her sweet slumber away. When she couldn’t, the brunette swung her legs over the side of the bed and heaved herself up. Checking the time on her phone, she snorted when she saw it was midnight- the witching hour. Knowing that sleep would only evade her, she left her bedroom for the kitchen, a good cup of coffee on her mind.
As she passed by her front door, a chill spread like liquid fire down her spine. It’s only winter, she told herself, focusing again on the coffee plan. Measuring out scoops, water, and preparing her cup kept her occupied, but as the dark liquid boiled, she had nothing left to keep her mind from wandering off. The chill returned and she couldn’t help but glance behind her to the front door. It stood there innocently enough, just like always. The dead bolt was still in place and she could see nothing amiss with it. Turning back to her coffee, she did her best to forget about the feeling.
With her cup in hand, she started back towards her bedroom. As she walked by the front door, she decided that a quick glance out of the peep hole would help calm her restless mind. The chill worsened with each step she took towards the door and further away from the safety and warmth of her blankets. She pressed her empty hand against the cold, metal door and took a deep breath before leading her eye to the peep hole.
At first, she could only see an inky blackness and somehow seemed to swirl in itself. When she blinked in surprise, the void melted away. She wished it hadn’t. In it’s place, there stood what she could only guess was once a man. The limbs were long and inhumanly awkward, with bulky joints branching off into several arms, not unlike the branches of a tree. The creature was drapped in a black suit, somehow manking the thing more nightmarish to her. The icing on the proverbial cake, however, was what passed as the hellish thing’s face. It was as though her mind blurred the ghastly visage to spare itself further shock and horror.
She shoved herself away from the door with the hand still pressed against it. The scalding mug of coffee fell, the liquid burning her bare legs as she fell backwards and tried to crawl away from the door. She knew, somehow, that her mind hadn’t been playing tricks on her. As she crab walked away from the door, she watched as tendrels as black as the void she first saw snake around through the cracks. The girl was trapped between the instinct to flee and the gut feeling to not turn her back on the door. When the door jolted, the urge to flee overcame her and she slipped in the burning liquid as she tried to make it back to her room.
She knew deep down that she was trapping herself in a corner, but she had to get away from the door. The girl was halfway down the hallway when she heard the previously locked door creak open. She screamed and slipped into a wall, cracking her chin on it and stunning her.
After that, there was only blackness.

“Nicole?” a warm, male voice snapped the woman out of her trance. As she turned around, she was met by one of her sister’s doctor’s. She nodded, not sure if she should say anything, or even if she could find her voice if she did have something to say. That morning, she had gotten an urgent phone call from the hospital, saying that her sister, Lindsay, was there. Before they had even let her see her, the doctor’s had pulled her off to the side and insisted that they talk to her about what might have happened. Phrases like ‘self-inflected’ and ‘assault’ had been thrown around and Nicole felt her mind reel.
She still hadn’t fully understood what they had been saying until she saw Lindsay with her own eyes. Her little sister had a bandage wrapped around her head, covering both of her ears as well as her eyes. They said it was to keep her now deadened eyes from drying out and to try to keep infection out of the wounds Lindsay had made to her ears. The doctors had guessed that either she or someone else had jammed a pencil into them to keep her off balance or to deafen herself against something. There was the mix of first and second degree burns on her hands, legs, and feet, from what was assumed to be the coffee her neighbors found slipped all over the entry to her apartment.
As Nicole walked into her sister’s hospital room the first time, she thought she had spied the silhouette of a man in the window. That, she knew, was impossible. Her sister’s room was on the third story of the hospital.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_vmd9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vmd9k/slenderman/,

In the nightmare I would just go through my every day routine. Get up, go to work, normal stuff. They weren't really even nightmares until I woke up. In the dream I felt normal and didn't notice anything being off. But when I woke up, I realized that every time I saw my reflection on something, there was a person watching me with wide eyes. I would never be able to remember the person's face when I wake up, which made it even worse. I would understand if it was a face I've seen before, since that's how the brain works, but it's almost as if it had no face, because the only thing I remember is the eyes. This went on for a month. Then something changed. It was no longer looking at me in the reflections. It was everywhere. Everyone was staring at me. Everybody had their eyes wide and just kept staring at me, and I didn't notice it until I woke up. In the dream I would talk to people without getting an answer, and they just kept staring. I started seeing it in the real life too. Appearing where someone else was standing when a car drove by, and dissapearing when I turn to look. Sometimes when I woke up, it would stand over me next to my bed, and dissapear when I blink. I even saw it in videos, replacing the face of any people. Last week, I booted up my computer to look for people with experiences of this kind of problem, and my wallpaper was this picture: http://i.imgur.com/ItCJwGy.jpg

I don't know what to do now. Everywhere I look I see it. I can't talk to anyone, I can't go to work. I tried to call a friend of mine, all I heard was static. I hear someone calling out my name, saying ''I'm watching'' somewhere in the house. What have I done to deserve this? Is it just me? Am I losing my mind? I can't take this, whatever happens, I'm watching. I'm watching. I'm watching you.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_17tgwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/17tgwz/the_watcher/,

At first I thought it was just the mist. Cold, flat, gray blanket that held the sleeping world. Soon enough the sun would break through. The sheets would slowly pull away and show me that everything was awake and ready to go. 

That was four days ago. 

I got up and looked out the window. I remember thinking to myself that traffic was going to be a bitch. I took a shower...I remember the water was cold...not cold like how you would think water is cold because the water heater stopped working. It wasn't even really ""cold""...like temperature wise. It was just flat. That's the only way I can think to describe it. Like how a soda gets flat if you leave it sitting out for a long time. Only the water felt..flat..like all the energy had just been sucked out of it. I got out without washing my hair. 

I went in the kitchen and that's when I noticed how quiet the world was. It was still gray outside, but there should have been something. Car horns, engines, the neighbors slamming their doors as they leave. Nothing. I opened the door to the balcony and stood outside. The air felt like it it was just old, like it should have been musty but someone just forgot to add smell. Still no sound. I leaned out over the railing to see better. I could only see a few feet of building on either side of my balcony. The neighbors balconies had the shades drawn on both sides. 

I went back in and turned on the television and there was...nothing. Not even static, if they even have that anymore, or an emergency broadcast station. It wasn't even a no signal message on the screen like if I disconnected the cable box. It was just channel after channel of gray nothing. 

I grabbed my keys to head outside and had unlocked the deadbolt, and was reaching to open the door. Just on a whim I looked out the peephole. 

Nothing. It should have been the hallway of my apartment building...but it was just more gray. Like the mist had gotten inside the building somehow, but there's no way that would have made any sense. I still should have been able to see the door across the hall

I just locked my door back and stood away. The door creaked like something heavy leaned against it. 

I tried calling the police, my mom, Lindsey, my work. There's no signal well, there's a signal. But no calls or messages go through. There's no facebook or twitter or news. I can load the internet but it's like no one decided to put up anything new that day...or the next...or the next. 

I tried to sleep, it's hard. It doesn't get dark. Everything outside just stays the same gray. The food tastes like, like cardboard. I'm not lying I plugged in my PS3 into the TV and tried playing a movie. Mission to Mars. I could start the movie but the first screen loads and none of the actors talk, or move. Everyone justs stands completely still and says nothing. I thought the movie froze but the timer keeps going. All the movies do the same thing. The first screen or preview loads in complete silence and the characters just stand completely still and mute. Two hours later, the credits start rolling. 

It's also hard to sleep because the only noise I do hear is the walls and the windows and the door creaking. I can feel it too. It's like...outside is just squeezing in, trying to crush my little world like and egg. Earlier today I felt like the pressure increased so hard that my ears popped when it eventually stopped. I can see the windows bulging in when it happens. I don't want to go back out on the balcony. 

I turned on the television about an hour ago. I turned the volume up as far as it would go and just flipped through every channel of gray not shit trying to hear anything. On channel 706, which is/was Fox News 5...just for a brief moment, I thought I heard a voice whisper ""help"" and then this...sound...like something was breathing...but not breathing...like it was sucking in all the air in a room. And then nothing again.

The windows are bulging in so hard in the frames that they look like lenses now. 

The rest of the world is gone, and whatever took it wants in.

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself “The Holder of Defiance”. Should the worker stand up from his chair and smile, consider the gates of hell to be your next stop. Should the workers frown and look at you angrily, then you have made the right choice. The worker will remain silent as he reaches into his desk and grabs a small silver key, inscribed with two letters on it, you must look at it only for a second to memorize the letters, and then give it back to the Worker.

The worker will tell you to visit the last room on the hall to the left, don’t listen to him though; visit the one on the right instead. As you walk down the hall the paintings and pictures will turn black and white, if at any time a picture remains colorful then shout loudly and clearly “There is no harm in the innocent, even in anger!” If the hall turns red as blood then you will have no end to your torment. If the pictures continue to turn black and white then let out a sigh of relief. Upon reaching the end of the hall you will find a door with the name of your first principal inscribed on a plaque, you must enter this room.

When you enter the room you will see a child standing in the middle of the room, a single lamp displaying him. You mush approach him and say loudly to him “There is no comfort in the creation.” If the boy smiles, then he is not afraid of you, and he will enjoy toying with your soul for eternity, if he begins to cry, you must begin to punish him. Let loose every insult you can think of to this boy, have no mercy on his torment. After you have insulted him enough he will reach into his pocket and pull out a ribbon, with two letters on it. Recite the two letters from the ribbon and accept it. Next the boy will hand you a blade, dig the blade into him, killing the child you once were.

Walk to the edge of the room you are in, and open the door again, this time you will be outside the institution, holding the ribbon

This ribbon is object 318 out of 538 and they must never come together.

For the past three months, I would wake up, get out of bed and follow my usual morning routine right up until the point in which I leave my house. I’ve gotten used to it by this point, so I know what I’m in for. Turn on the flashlight, open my front door, and walk out of my house into what would usually be a bright and interesting neighbourhood. Instead, I walk straight into a dark hallway, where I can hear screams from people I can only assume are experiencing the same thing. As I walk down the hall I feel an overwhelming urge to scream too, but I’m not one to scream, or even cry for that matter. By now, I usually notice at least one thing I’ve never noticed about this hallway before. Last week I noticed the occasional locked door. In the previous months I noticed that strange patches of blood are staining the wooden ceiling. Today, I notice, that no matter which way I turn, the hallway is always leading forwards from the direction I’m facing.  This is a particularly interesting observation, as it means that either I can defy the direction of the hallway. Or, the hall will have me take its path even if I tried to venture another direction. Right now, my flashlight is running out of power. But today, I needed to go further, so I take out the glow stick I cleverly packed beforehand, and continue onwards. It doesn’t take long before I realise how glad I am that I kept going. I find the end of the hall, and a doorway. As I open the door, I expect the worst, and that is exactly what I get. It is a room, which looks like some sort of hospital, or at least a makeshift infirmary. Complete with the smell of disinfectant stinging my nostrils, and emergency procedure posters plastered all over the walls. But I don’t see any nurses, or doctors. All I can see is monsters. Craning their necks at impossible angles, and speaking in an unfathomable language. I get a feeling inside me that says they are too dangerous to continue living. A feeling of dread wells up inside me, and I know what I’ve been sent here to do. I panic, I run for the closest weapon I can find. On a nearby table, I see a used syringe, that’ll do. Fuelled by fear, I destroy the monsters that would otherwise have tried to do me harm. After I finish, I look around to see what they were doing here in the first place. I enter a room. The sign above the room is written in symbols that I don’t understand. I never would have guessed what I then find there. Bodies, shrivelled beyond recognition, I would have thought they were all dead if it weren’t for the panicked breathing. I dispose of their poor mutilated victims the only humane way I could think of. I go into the storage closets and various cupboards, until I found a bottle that I assume is morphine. To make sure they died, I inject four full syringes into each victim in hopes they would die a painless and chemical death. I hope that no one ever goes through what I just witnessed, and if they do, may God help them. As I leave that place, millions of thoughts race through my mind. Did I do the right thing? Will I ever see them again? Is it safe to go home? After thinking about all this and more, I leave the same way I came in. Which made sense, the only way to leave a place where monsters live, would be through that God forsaken hallway. When I finally arrive home, I feel a sense of relief wash over me. I sit down to watch some TV, and finally, relax. On the news, I see a story. “Drug crazed lunatic murders the occupants of the maternity wing in the hospital”. A horrific realisation washes over me. I get up to look out my window, and there are several police cars parked outside. But it looks as though the monsters killed them and are wearing their uniforms.

An egg


It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.

And that's when you met me.

""What... what happened?"" You asked. ""Where am I?""

""You died,"" I said, matter-of-factly. No point mincing words.

""There was a...a truck and it was skidding...""

""Yup."" I said

""I... I died?""

""Yup. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies."" I said.

You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. ""What is this place?"" You asked. ""Is this the afterlife?""

""More or less,"" I said.

""Are you god?"" You asked.

""Yup."" I replied. ""I'm God.""

""My kids... my wife,"" you said.

""What about them?""

""Will they be alright?""

""That what I like to see,"" I said. ""You just died and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff right there.""

You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man. Some vague authority figure. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.

""Don't worry,"" I said. ""They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.""

""Oh,"" you said. ""So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?""

""Neither,"" I said. ""You'll be reincarnated.""

""Ah,"" you said. ""So the Hindus were right.""

""All the religions are right in their own way,"" I said. ""Walk with me.""

You followed along as we strolled in the void. ""Where are we going?"" ""Nowhere in particular,"" I said. ""It's just nice to walk while we talk.""

""So what's the point, then?"" You asked. ""When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won't matter.""

""Not so!"" I said. ""You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don't remember them right now.""

I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. ""Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or cold. You put a tiny part or yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had.""

""You've been a human for the last 34 years, so you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for longer, you'd start remembering everything. But there's no point doing that between each life.""

""How many times have I been reincarnated, then?""

""Oh, lots. Lots and lots. And into lots of different lives."" I said. ""This time around you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D.""

""Wait, what?"" You stammered. ""You're sending me back in time?""

""Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.""

""Where do you come from?"" You pondered.

""Oh sure!"" I explained. ""I come from somewhere. somewhere else. and there are others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there but you honestly won't understand.""

""Oh."" you said, a little let down. ""But wait. If i get reincarnated to other places in time, could I have interacted with myself at some point?""

""Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own timespan you don't even know it's happening.""

""So what's the point of it all?""

""Seriously?"" I asked. ""Seriously? Your asking me for the meaning of life? Isn't that a little stereotypical?""

""Well it's a reasonable question."" you persisted.

I looked in your eye. ""The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.""

""You mean mankind? You want us to mature?""

""No. just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature, and become a larger and greater intellect"" ""Just me? What about everyone else?""

""There is no one else,"" I said. ""In this universe, there's just you, and me.""

You stared blankly at me. ""But all the people on earth...""

""All you. Different incarnations of you.""

""Wait. I'm everyone!?""

""Now you're getting it."" I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.

""I'm every human who ever lived?""

""Or who will ever live, yes.""

""I'm Abraham Lincoln?""

""And you're John Wilkes Booth, too."" I added.

""I'm Hitler?"" you said, appalled.

""And you're the millions he killed.""

""I'm Jesus?""

""And you're everyone who followed him.""

You fell silent.

""Every time you victimized someone,"" I said, ""You were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you've done, you've done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.""

""Why?"" You asked me. ""Why do all this?""

""Because someday, you will become like me. Because that's what you are. You're one of my kind. You're my child.""

""Whoa."" you said, incredulous. ""You mean I'm a god?""

""No. Not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing. Once you've lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.""

""So the whole universe,"" you said. ""It's just...""

""An egg of sorts."" I answered. ""Now its time for you to move on to your next life.""

And with that, I sent you on your way. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,black,True,t3_nhsai,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/nhsai/an_egg/,

A lump of hunched over flesh slumped in the corner of the room. I can see the individual bones of the skin rutting through the skin. The ragged blue material stretches over the back concealing most of the patched up skin but I can clearly see the thick welts and scars that sit half burrowed under the flesh and half raised in ugly mountains. From my point of view I can see its back; I can see two curled up feet with long nails; but I can’t see its face.

I shouldn’t be here. This is a huge mistake. I had taken the opportunity to stay home alone. Thank fuck I thought, parents out, siblings gone, time for me to do what the fuck I want. So I had. A beer, huge sandwich, played video games. Chill. Fancied something else, something meaty. Checked the fridge, ransacked the cupboards, nothing decent, nothing I could stick my teeth into. 

Popped another beer and sat down. Played a few more rounds, swapped games, played again. Set the controller down. Starving. Really fricking hungry. 
The cellar it is. Crushed my beer can and walked round to the back door, one hand massaging my belly. Swallowing, thinking of bacon. Juicy hamburgers. Man I want something.

I wedged the back door open with a block of wood and jogged to the cellar.  Threw open the doors flicked my lighter open and started down the stairs. My father kept his stash of beautifully prepared meat in the cellar and I had my eye on a nice piece of bacon. The bottom step creaked as I left the stairs and I walked the few paces to the back of the room. Small space. Good, food was closer. Opened the fridge and my stomach rumbled. I found the meat, then heard my back door bang shut.

I dropped my lighter.

Fuck.
Took a deep breath, cursed again and bent down to pick it up. I touched something soft and screamed. I tried to jump to the top of the fridge, knocked my knee and fell flat on this lump of moving wheezing flesh. I kicked and wriggled and scrabbled for the lighter and I could hear it clawing the ground and breathing these long rattling gasps. I found my lighter and backed up to the wall. But I couldn’t light the lighter, I shook it in the dark and stopped. I could hear it.
I heard the thing rattle and scratch the floor. It began to wail, it had a high pitched screaming whisper like a kittling boiling. Scratch scratch. My back was pushed firmly against the cold stone wall. I heard it creep nearer and nearer, shuffling as if it were crawling. Long slow scratches. Then silence. 

I stayed still. One hand over my mouth, not breathing, getting dizzy. It’s a cat I told myself. A fucking cat. I couldn’t hear anything. 
Took a deep breath, flicked my lighter, and thrust my hands out colliding with its faces inches away. The thing screamed and charged to the opposite wall itself into a wall. 
And now I’m here. Lighter casting a dim glow on this curled up rancid faceless thing. 

I can’t move. I can’t decide. I looked down at my hand, my fingers were gripping the meat so tightly, small chunks had fallen to the floor. I could smell the meat and my sweat. The thing began to move. It let out a wailing howl. And turned its face to me. It had no eyes and long scratch marks down its face. Its mouth wide open it let a low moan. The skin stretched over its cheekbones as saliva dripped from its black gums and to the floor. With arms outstretched it lunged.
That was ten minutes ago. Now it lay flat out on the floor its empty sockets locked on mine, lower lip wet. 

I can’t decide.

On the one hand I could eat my dad’s prepared meat, on the other I had the fresh real thing right in front of me.

I’ve always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.

I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.

It was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment. It was a quiet night, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot. The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.

I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each “box” with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.

Deciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by. The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving. He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.

I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back… and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward. Smile still wide on his lips.

I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn’t move.

Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street and sidewalk ahead of me were completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn’t tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.

I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated tip toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.

I’d like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn’t. I just stood there, completely frozen as the smiling man crept toward me.

And then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky.

When I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, “What the fuck do you want?!” in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, “What the fuu…?”

Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn’t react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling.

And then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn’t moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.

I ran too.

I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.

I lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn’t look drunk, he didn’t look high. He looked completely and utterly insane.

When they were finished, the boy gathered the plates and silverware, and left the room to the kitchen. When he returned, he was holding a small cloth. The adults were laughing at a joke the man just told. The boy removed the cloth, and was holding a meat cleaver. He brought the sharp blade upon the travelers head.

to visit his uncle for some days as his parents had to attend a wedding in Coimbatore. One evening he and some other of my college friends went to Malad for a movie. He had so much fun that he forgot that it's very late. He caught the last local bus to Borivalli and he reached Borivalli (5th block) around midnight.


He had to walk about a mile from the bus stop to home... 
As he was walking alone, he could sense that the night felt very creepy as it was so dark. While walking, he was astonished to see an old creepy looking guy selling some books. 
It was a very unusual thing to see a thing like that... 
It got the shivers on him when he noticed that his old guy 
is unusually pale and staring at him... 


The old guy said ""Son why don't you get a book...it would keep you company"". Then he did something which he would regret for the rest of his life... My friend started to act brave &amp; thought why not &amp; had a look at his collections... My friend's hair started to rise up as he noticed that all the books were related to supernatural activities... 
but he found one that was very interesting. So he asked the old man 
""How much is it?""... 
The old guy replied, ""Well son... this is an interesting book...it's only for $25. 
My friend was shocked and said ""But...but... that's expensive"" This time the old man stared which freaked my friend.
My friend quickly checked all his pockets &amp; found $20 &amp; said ""This is all I have."" The old guy replied ""It's OK son... 
you can have the book for that price"" As my friend was just about to run for home... the old man called back &amp; said ""Son ... whatever happen, you don't ever flip the book to it's last page... remember these words or you would regret...!!!"" 


My friend nodded and never looked back ... Reaching home...he quickly asked his uncle whether there was any new old book seller nearby? The Uncle replied ""Not that I know of but ...we've heard that there's an old man comes once in a while during full moon nights and heard that there is something creepy about it...why son?"" 


My friend freaked out... he told his uncle ""Nothing uncle... just asking"". He started reading the book with the old man's words on his mind. At night, 12 0'clock, as he went to bed, a gush of wind blew which chilled him up to his bones. At that glimpse, he noticed the wind had blown the pages to its last page. He remembered what the old man has said! But we humans tend to have the tendency to know. Out of curiosity, he flipped to 
the last page &amp; fainted... 

What he saw at the last page is stated below:

It was a normal day for me , same old crap. I was at work around 1PM. 

At 7PM I was finished and started to walk home , there was a small woodland area that I would usually cut through to get home faster. As I was walking through the woodland I saw a man , I had never seen anyone else in this area before so I felt the need to say hello , ""Hello?"" I yelled , but there was no reply from the man , I heard screaming from behind me it caught my attention so I turned around , turned out it was just some young kids playing about on the street , when I turned back the man was gone and no were to be seen. I didn't think the man was anything to worry about... I would soon find out I was wrong.

I saw him again - 16th Febuary 

It was my friends birthday , he was having a small house party there was probably about 15 people there. We were drinking and talking like you normally would at a house party. I had been there about 2 hours now when I started to feel nauseous my stomach was hurting so I decided to go outside for some fresh air. I looked into the distance of the dark street and saw something that stuck fear into my heart. A man , but no normal man , he was extremely tall with long slender arms wearing what appeared to be a suit , it was dark so I couldn't tell exactly what the colour of his skin was but he looked awfully pale almost completely white. I thought my illness was causing hallucinations so I when home to sleep.

Researching - 17th Febuary 

The day after I saw the man I called in sick , I felt in no condition to work. I decided to search about this thing I saw on the Internet to see if anyone else had the same experience , as I was searching I found lots of story's about people who saw the man and every story said the same thing , ' after you see the 'slenderman' you will get nauseous and will eventually experience extreme paranoia ' I had already experienced one of the symptoms. Every story contained a image of this 'slenderman' and it was exactly what I had saw that night ... A tall man wearing a suit , with long slender arms and white skin , but on all these pictures it showed what I didn't see.... It's face . It didn't have one.

The last I remember - 23rd of Febuary 

I was walking through the woodland again to go home , still worrying about the slenderman. I had been walking through the woodland for about 5 minuets and then I saw him. The man I saw the last week was there again. It didn't look like the slenderman , but I had to be sure , I needed to know who this man with. I followed him I new I shouldn't but I just had to. I had been following the man for a short time when I heared branches snapping behind me I turned quickly to look , but nothing was there. I turned around slowly and was shocked to see a blank face staring at me... He had no eyes. No mouth. No features. I heared static screetching through my ears , and then I collapsed.

I woke up in a hospital bed 3 months later... I had been in a deep coma. The doctors even considered shutting down my life support, I sat up in the hospital bed and looked out the window ... And there he was

I remember that one night I had to stay at my Aunt Janice's house. She lived deep in the country, far away from any large city. I was a city kid. Video games and the internet were my hobbies at the age of thirteen, and I was pained when I had to leave them. 

For the first night in the two story house I was forced to stay in my cousin's old room. Her name was Sierra, and she had passed away last year. She was four years old, approximately, when she fell from the window on the second floor. Her bed was nice and comfy, but I hated the decorations she had.

Every shelf in the room was lined with dolls. Not the new Bratz and Barbie dolls, the baby ones whose eyes are perfect circles and seem to follow you around. All four walls were covered with the shelves they sat on, and even the bed had one above the pillows where one doll sat. It was the only bald baby doll in the room. They were all completely expressionless. 

We had mashed potatoes and gravy that evening and I decided to go to bed. I crawled under the warm blankets and the sheet and shut the nearby lamp off.

The dolls were staring at me, all of them. All four walls seemed to look down at me... completely expressionless. I covered my head in the blanket and tried to sleep, but couldn't. I got up and turned the lamp on. After I stood, I looked back at the maniacal doll that sat above my head. It was dressed in pink baby clothes and seemed to be facing me. I turned around and tried to open the door, finding that it was locked. I pounded on it, my heart beginning to race. ""Someone want to let me out of here?"" I asked. 

My spine shivered at the thought of the baby dolls watching me, the sounds of their malevolent laughter ringing through my head. I turned back around to the doll to find that it was no longer on the headrest, but was on the pillow. It looked up at me, smiling. ""What the hell?"" I whispered to myself. I turned around to the door and pounded on it some more. ""Someone let me out of here!"" I shouted. I turned back around, and the doll was further down the bed, and it seemed another doll had moved from the shelf by the window to the window sill. Its hands were on the lock to the window, just barely touching it... It had blonde hair like Sierra did...

I slammed on the door. ""LET ME OUT, DAMN IT!"" I shouted. The door opened and my older sister stood there, laughing. I fell to the ground, eyes widened in fear. ""Why the hell did you lock the door?"" I asked.

""I thought it'd be funny."" she replied. She looked over me and saw the expressionless dolls in their places. ""Playing with dolls?""

""No."" I replied.

""Then explain that."" she demanded, playing with her long, brown hair. 

I tried to find words to explain what just happened, but couldn't. ""I don't know how that happened, but I am NOT sleeping in there again,""

""Fine, I'll sleep in there tomorrow night, you big baby."" she replied. I went with her to the living room and tried to sleep on the floor while she was on the couch. I had no luck.

The next night came. After dinner we headed to bed, saying our good nights. She went upstairs and I stayed on the couch. I thought to myself what I might be able to do to entertain myself, so I want upstairs and locked her door. I then went back downstairs, too tired to stay up and hear her reactions, and passed out.

The next morning I awoke to ambulances outside, my mother jerking me awake. ""Son, there's something wrong. We're going to the hospital, your sister is seriously hurt."" 

The worst possibilities came to mind. I bolted upstairs and unlocked the door, opening it to find the most horrific image I have ever seen.

Every doll in the room was on its shelf, only their heads were facing the now open windows... well, most of their heads were. All of the babies were smiling widely, like they were amused by the open window. I looked over to the top of the bed to see another baby doll... only with long, brown hair, just like my sister's. It smiled maniacally, a far larger smile than any of the other dolls. It pointed to the pillow, and on the pillow was a piece of paper. In dark, blood red ink, were these words...

""Rock a bye baby, on the tree top,
Please save me, someone. Just make it stop...""

I looked away from the writing and bolted over to the window to look out and see what happened. I watched the EMT's zip the body bag over my sister's face. The last thing I ever saw of her was her blank expression... much like a doll... There was a slam behind me. I turned around to find that the dolls were all facing me and the door was closed... Not even the closed door could handle the weight of my fearful, angry body knocking it down.

I made sure we never visited Aunt Janice's again.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1hvpe8,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hvpe8/playing_with_dolls/,
1372446250.0,41,self.creepypasta,1h9ksi,"So, my cousin is a doctor...",itsinyoursoul,63,22,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1h9ksi/so_my_cousin_is_a_doctor/,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but it seems appropriate that I write it here. If I should post it in a different subreddit, at least I’m quite sure you guys will know what it is.
My cousin called me yesterday, around 10 pm, saying he needs a drink and to talk to someone, but mainly a drink, so I tell him to come home. We’re good friends, even if we don’t see each other much, but I had some beers on the refrigerator and I love the guy, so even if it was late, I had no problem with it. My wife is okay with that too, but she is tired so she locks herself in our room, with our baby. (Rereading that paragraph, it seems to be a set up for something to happen to them, no, the story has nothing to do with any of them, they’re fine, don’t worry.)
So, my cousin gets home, I open the door and hit him up with a beer, when he picks it up I notice a bandage on his middle finger. I ask what happened, he says “Later”, so we sit at the desk and play some poker, no bets, just to loosen up. After the second bottle (we have liter bottles down here), he starts talking.
Yesterday he had the night shift at the Emergency Room – he works at a public hospital in Capital Federal, the capital of Argentina. It never is a good shift, stab wounds, bullet wounds, burned people and lots of alcohol poisoning, he even witnessed a knife fight right there in the waiting room, once. But last night had been quiet, and four hours into his shift, he had only seen one case, a guy who cut himself with a glass. So, it’s 2 am, and a homeless lady bursts into the waiting room, screaming “It’s eating me, it’s eating me”, and leaving a trail of blood at her feet. The lady has to be 50-60 by the looks of her, and to everyone’s surprise, she’s pregnant. Like, really pregnant, so they think that due to her age she’s having a miscarriage, the take her to the operation room, she keeps screaming that it’s eating her and thrashing about. They sedate her, as she’s not letting anyone check her and see what’s wrong, and they try to look for life signs of the infant. Surprisingly, the little guy is really well, better than he should be, the sedatives should have put it a little bit to sleep, but it was still kicking (I’m going to refer to it as it because… well, keep reading). They proceed to perform a c-section, really carefully because the thing was still thrashing about and moving a lot, and when they open up, there’s blood everywhere, the baby is completely drenched in blood, so my cousin takes him out, the baby moving with much more strength than a newborn should have, already screaming and breathing. 
At first, they thought the baby had two umbilical cords, neither of them attached to the placenta. They checked the normal one, the one attached to its belly, and the part where it has been cut has apparently been chewed off. The other umbilical cord, a little bit below the first one, turns out to be the things dick, 4 inches long, almost as long as the things legs. The nurse who should have taken the boy ran off the room, sickened by that, and my cousin goes to clean the baby a bit. The thing’s skin is totally red, they couldn’t tell because of the blood, but the thing is red… and it has teeth, as my cousin learned when the thing bit him (He took off the bandage when he told me this, nasty wound, three suture points). My cousin puts the baby in the little crib they have waiting for it and pushes it away from the room, to take it to neonatology. (BTW, he was not the main doctor, there was an actual surgeon there doing the procedures, my cousin just got his degree two years ago so he’s usually just tending to minor cases or assisting on more serious things).
The mother survived, she had been bitten from the inside. It’s eating me was actually an accurate thing to scream. The thing is still in neo, it refuses to drink formula and shows no signs of weakening.
I don’t want to believe this story, I really hope it’s just my cousin messing up with me, but if it’s a prank, it’s the first one he’s ever pulled on me and he did look scared. But fuck it, he’s probably lying. Right?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: It was bullshit, a lot of the things were real but the story is less creepy and more sad:

The mother came screaming ""It's eating me"" and bleeding, she really looked old but it was because of lots of drug abuse, she was 30, baby was a she (bit about the giant dick was actually reversed, it came with a bit of umbilical cord stuck there and they thought it was a huge dick at first).
Baby did come out with two huge front teeth and bit my cousin, the two huge teeth are probably caused by use of marihuana during pregnancy. Baby died at around 9 pm, mother should be out of the hospital by monday, she didn't even know she was pregnant.

My cousin made that story up because he was not ready to tell the real deal, first time he had a baby die on him And for some reason he felt they bonded after she almost ate his finger. (Baby died because drug abuse prevented proper organ formation or something like that, it's more complicated but thhat's what I understood)



And now I feel the creepy story would have been better.

It comes up in our lives, usually in our dreams which leads to the creation of nightmares. This is why we call our fears ""our worst nightmares"". However, our fears don't like that. The term ""nightmare"" is disrespectful to them. It takes away from their power. They can't control us through a nightmare because a nightmare is only in our heads, in our thoughts. Right?


 Nightmares are our greatest fears captured in our thoughts to create a joke of them. If we only permit them to be thoughts, what can they do? Yes, our nightmares are scary and as kids they often cause us to sleep with our parents or with a nightlight because we are scared of the dreams. But that's all was: a dream. But every once in a while, there is the nightmare, that you have multiple times, that scares you for years and keeps you awake for many days and nights. That's what they want. Our fears want us to stay awake. If they scare us awake, then they can't be a nightmare anymore because we aren't dreaming about them. We are going out of our way trying to forget them. They are now a fear again. As a fear, they can now control your thoughts, control what you do, and harm you in your most vulnerable point.


 Your life now revolves around trying to avoid all instances where that fear might come up. You jump at your phone ringing, at a dog barking, at your wife walking in the room. We never expect our fears to control us in this way. Once we begin to feel jittery and anxious, we not only hears things: we see them too. We see the figures and the faces that have haunted our dreams before. We turn away and when we turn back they are gone. However, when they return they are closer. When we close our eyes, they are are burned into our eyelids. When we blink, our fears inch closer. They reach out to you, trying to catch hold of you. They strain to grab you and get revenge on you for what you did to them. For taking away their power and embarrassing them. For stripping them of their pride and making a joke of them and calling them a nightmare. 


What your fear will do to you, I don't know. You created it. Just don't blink. It creator vs creation now.

At 8:50AM. You're still ten minutes early, so decide to wait outside and light up a cigarette. After you've finished you head up the steps and into the office for another busy day on the phones.

Finally, after five hours work you're allowed out to grab some lunch. But that bastard who works in the office with you follows you out. He calls after you and asks you if you'd like to join him, and you agree, even though you don't really like him, he doesn't get you, he doesn't make you happy. There's only one person who can really make you happy.

On the way back, you both stop outside for another smoke. He tells a joke and you laugh, even though it's not funny, and stamp out your cigarettes and both head back inside.

At last, it's 5:00PM and you're able to leave after a hard days work. Visibly tired you head down the steps and start the walk home. The bastard calls you again and asks if you'd like to come round for a drink, like he does every night. But as always you kindly decline and head back home.

Once you're home, you start cooking yourself some dinner. It's lasagne. You've always been a good cook and it looks and smells delicious. You sit yourself down in front of the television and eat up your dinner. Then after a couple hours of relaxing, you head upstairs for another shower.

You open the window to let the steam out and jump into the hot shower. When you finish, you step out, your dripping wet, naked body glistening in the bathroom light before you wrap a towel round you and go to dry your hair.

After you've finished you put on your pyjamas and plop a couple of sleeping pills into a glass of water, which begin to fizz as they sink to the bottom. You used to have trouble sleeping, but with these pills the doctor recommended you sleep like a log. It's a warm night, so you open the bedroom window and head back into the bathroom to brush your teeth.

Finally you slump into bed and quickly gulp down the water. You feel the pills start to work almost immediately, and you rest your tired head on the pillow and slowly your eyes close, finally you can rest after another busy day of hard work.

And finally I can come in.

I've waited all day for this. I slip though the open window and quietly creep towards your sleeping body. You look so beautiful when you're asleep.

I say it's best if you stick to being a rational person. If anything, you'll die peacefully. 

Also, don't mind the creaking.

When we came back, I found a Notepad document on my desktop entitled ""summation"". It seems like a draft for a story. I think my roommate may have written it, but I didn't know he was much of a writer. Anyways, it's a bit creepy so I thought I'd post it here:*

What have you done for the one you love? I'd wager a lot of stupid shit. I'm no different. Just some stupid fucking guy who got himself into some stupid fucking situation over some stupid fucking girl. Pardon my language. It's hard to refrain.

I don't know why I'm writing this stupid fucking letter. No one is going to fucking read it. I'm entirely alone. Mostly. I don't know. Alone isn't the right word. It's like the fucking Matrix where I am.

See, the way it works is that I'm the only one who's real. Okay, that sounded really fucking crazy, and it's not even entirely accurate. The problem is that I've ventured outside the usual jurisdiction of things like language. There literally aren't adequate words to quickly summarize the situation I'm in.

Okay, have you ever seen Groundhog Day? My situation is similar, except it's a whole year and I'm not totally sure but I think I'm still physically aging. Just really slowly. I don't know, I've been around the track like 15 times at the time of writing this. I think. I don't know, I lost count.

I know my speech seems disjointed, and I'm surprised you're even still reading. It's really hard to keep focused on this stuff long enough to tell it, for various reasons. I tried posting my story from the beginning on the internet, but I think only the first part went through. It seems like after that first time everything I write or whatever seems to vanish once the reset happens. Like, retroactively or something. But it didn't immediately. I don't know, like I said, words can't really adequately describe the stuff going on because it's not fucking physics.

I guess it's magic? Who the fuck knows. I'll try to explain what happened, but I'm not going to go into extreme detail because it's a fucking waste of time; as soon as the year ends, this writing will fucking vanish. I think. I don't even know that for sure, now that I think of it.

Basically, the short story is that I used to be a freshman in college. I guess I still sort of am, but I never really go. I mostly just wander because sitting in one place for year after year would literally drive me crazier than I already am. Ramble ramble ramble.

College student. Anyways, I was a college student in the year 2020 (or so I thought, I'll come back to that). There was this girl I really liked, so I started moving on her which was a lot less creepy than it sounds. Mostly nervous laughter and bad jokes. I'm no fucking Adonis.

Eventually, she thought I was cute and we started dating. It was awesome. Even with where I've ended up, I still really miss her. But that's not important. What is important is that another girl totally dug her too, and this other girl was really weird and shit. Like wiccan or something (again, or so I thought. PLOT TWISTS LATER).

So she totally cursed me. It started small. Little things to fuck with me. I'd lose track of a few minutes at a time. Then shit got weird. The first time I really started to notice something was when the staring started. Basically, every minute on the dot everyone in my line of vision would stop everything they were doing, stare at me for a solid second, then go back to whatever they were doing. It got progressively weirder. People on TV started doing it, etc.

After a few days of maddening terror, I stumbled across my first Blinker. Someone like me, stuck out of time. They'd been stuck a lot longer than me at the time (10 years then, not sure where he is now. Probably dead). I was lucky. Really lucky. Because he explained everything to me, instead of killing me. Which will make sense in a moment.

Remember creepy wiccan girl? Not actually a creepy wiccan girl. Nope. Pagan Goddess. She kept falling in love with mortals, and her favorite method of punishing those of us who conflicted with her little flings was locking us in a time loop. But she's also a total bitch, because she left us a way out.

If we manage to find someone who's similarly stuck, that overlaps so we can actually interact, and we manage to kill them, we will be unstuck. That's how she gets rid of us so it doesn't end up being literally every human being in history stuck in time loops.

Fun fact: I've had 4 attempts on my life in the past 15 years. So I'm also always running. It's like a perverse race: 2 people are desperately trying to find and kill me in the time where our loops overlap, before they get sent back to the start of the track to make another lap around.

Ah, but that's not everything. See, I'm not actually from the year 2020. Apparently I was born in 1990, and I got stuck in a loop between 2012 and 2013. In fact, my loop resets in a week. So this is my last chance before I have to pack up and run again. For the 15th time.

But back to the 2020 thing. Basically,  Morrigan (Pagan Goddess) implanted some bullshit memories in my head to fuck with me even more. I'm not even really sure what my real name is.

Also, there's more. The ticks (what I call it when people stop and stare at me every minute. Yeah, it still happens) have been happening more frequently. And very recently, the people affected have started acting differently. It's not really a bewildered stare anymore. Now it's almost like a glare.

I'm scared. The last few nights, I've seen shadows outside my curtains. It feels like someTHING, not someONE, is following me through my loop.

So, I guess that's it. I used to have a set of rules I'd give out when trying to communicate, but there's no fucking point. We are not the higher power. We are just toys to them. And eventually, we'll be thrown out.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1imbpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1imbpe/file_i_found_on_my_laptop/,

We stop the car, and the dog's owner, an attractive female jogger in a dusty pink tank top, approaches the car. We roll down the window, letting in a gust of surprisingly chilly air. ""Don't mind Bug,"" she says, in a kind yet sad and distant voice. ""He's just excited."" She explains that about 300 feet up the road, the dog had spotted a rattlesnake, and that after sniffing at it, the rattler had struck, but Bug had jumped back. Then, because he's none too bright, he went sniffing at it again. She'd pulled him away, and continued their jog downhill.

Hydnsek explains that we are heading up to the pet cemetery, but the jogger just looks at us as if she was trying to remember something long forgotten. ""I don't know of any cemetery up there, but keep an eye out for the snake,"" she warns. We thank her for the advice, and head up to the cache. 

I don't know where she was jogging to, or if she was planning on heading back uphill or had a ride waiting down below. It seemed awfully warm and far too hazy to be jogging an uphill dirt road, so I hope she had other plans. We continue up to the cache site, passing the site where the dog had tangled with the snake, and found the cache fairly quickly.

After finding the next three caches on the route, we head back down the hill and stop at the convenience store nearby. ""You know what?"" I ask Hydnsek and Alciato. ""I didn't see the dog-walking jogger on the way back. Did you?"" They hadn't, but the clerk behind the counter drops a jar of pickled eggs, which shatters, sending glass and vinegar water skittering across the floor. He doesn't even seem to notice.

""You saw a jogger with her dog up there?"" he asks me, with an expression that means that this may be the most important question he's ever asked in his life.

""Yeah,"" I say. ""About half an hour ago.""

""What did she look like? What kind of dog?""

I describe her, her dusty pink tank top, her far away demeanor, and her large black lab.

The clerk turns pale. ""That was my sister,"" he says, looking me dead in the eyes. ""She died five years ago today. Rattlesnake bite.""

I've been plauged with the troubles of lonliness and being casted out from society since early childhood. For most of my life, I've fantisized about being loved. Love is something that, to this day, I have never felt. I spend most of my days, and nights, sitting in solitude simply wanting someone to talk to. 

During highschool, I quickly learned to mask these problems with the help of drugs. Traditional, most commonly used drugs did nothing for me. They only made me over analyze my problems. However, there was one drug that completely changed me and my outlook on life: Diphenhydramine, also known as Benadryl.  This OTC medication creates a nightmare in your head when taken in extrmeme amounts. 

The first time I took this drug was very memorable. It started out with me having a very difficult night, and simply taking all of the pills I could find in my medecine cabinet. I spent the rest of the night thinking ""This must be what death is like. Nothing is more nightmarish than your worst very frears coming true. I have died and gone to hell."" 

At first, I saw spiders. They crawled all over the walls, the floor, the cieling, and me. Everywhere I looked, covered in nothing but that terrifying moving blackness. They spun infinite webs, and crawled from the webs to me. Once they reached me, they would crawl all over my arms and legs, going under my chlothes till they could reach the skin, and then they would bite. I just sat there in utter horror, not able to move to do anything. 

Then the voices came. I would hear completely unknown voices speaking to me in a tounge I had never heard before, yet I could understand every single horible word that came out of their mouths. One said to me in the horrid language of theirs ""The worst is yet to come, trust me."" Later would I learn how right he really was...

I somehow worked up the will to move. I crawled outside my room, into my hallway, trail of spiders behind me. I hopelessly crawled on the floor, somehow hoping that moving from there would take me away from this nightmare. 
	
The next thing I saw immediately froze me in my tracks and sent a shock of fear through me. The spiders disappeared, the voices stopped. All I saw in front of me was a dark, black sillouete, staring deep, deep inside me. He didn't talk, or move, only stared. What he conveyed through his stare was more than any word, phase, or sentence can convey: Utter, complete, and absolute fear. 
I knew who this was, he conveyed it with his glare. He was the essense of fear, pure fear. I sat there for ages, completely in utter shock. After much time, he started to chukle. Not much like a normal laugh, a very low, gutteral one. He walked over, casting shadows in every direction of the room, and sat down in one of my chairs. He spoke to me. 
	
""Never come back to this place."" 
I woke up in my room, on my bed. I staggered over to the other side of my room, extremely disoriented and confused. It was early morning. 
	
Hours later, I noticed something was different. I was still hearing the voices, in whispers. I couldn't make out exactly what they were saying, every once in a while I could make out my name. It sounded like there were many of them, discussing me. Shadows would pass over me, or studder around in the corner of my vision every once in a while. The spiders were still there too, but instead of attacking me, they clung to surfaces, staring at me, disappearing when I looked away. 

This continued for many months. I spent every waking day completely enveloped into my own fantasy, until I had convinced myself it was no longer a fantasy. Once I learned this, it became very different. I would talk to my hallucinations, having every day conversations with them until they disapeared. I would shrug it off and continue whatever I was doing. 

I became obsessed with seeing the man I had seen that night. I wanted to know who he was, his story, and where I really was that night. I would speak to my hallucinations about this, and they would always act like it was quite strange, and disappear shortly. 

These symptoms of HPPD and skitzopherenia became much more intense as time went on. I began to have terrible memory loss. I would spend days, speaking to hallucinations and living in my fantasy, to completely forget about it soon after. My personality became very different. I felt supperior to everyone I spoke to. I was abolutely, completely insane. 

One day, after spending an afternoon enveloped in darkness, listening to voices, I walked into my living room. It was pitch black dark. I heard a faint sound coming from the hallway as my eyes ajsuted to the darkness.  I peered down the hallway. I saw a boy, helplessly crawling across the floor. As soon as he saw me, he froze deep in his tracks. He looked completely helpless, terrified. This humored me.

I started chuckled at the idea that it was so terrifying. I sat down in my chair, and gazed at this pathetic boy.

My wife’s not here. She asked me if I wanted to join her in browsing for a new washing machine. I told her no. I’d much rather stay at home. She left to find a new washing machine, even though the one we have now works just fine. I used it just an hour ago.

My father’s not here. He lives with us, since his wife died. He’s an old, grey, bespectacled little man. I love him, but he never says much to me. He’s old-fashioned. He used to cut wood for a living; he earned a nice little living on it. People need wood here, I guess. I never notice the cold. Being old, my father certainly notices the cold, always complaining about it and nagging me to throw some wood on the fire, but I never do. He told me that I would absolutely never listen to him or reason. He’s wrong, you know. I used the fireplace just an hour ago.

My son’s not here. David always has something to do; he never seems to stay in one place very long. He’s sixteen, handsome, charming—he gets all the girls, and I know that’s why he always goes. He asked me if he could borrow my car before he left. I told him no, and he threw his typical fit. He said I always stay inside and never use my car for anything. That’s not true. I used the car just an hour ago.


My dog’s not here. She’s really a puppy, not much older than a few months, but still almost big enough to take me down with enough speed. She always jumps on me when it’s time for her walk. I never walk her, but for some reason I’m the one she’s most attached to. I tell her no each time. She even learned to fetch her leash and bring it to me, as if it were some sort of incentive or to send me on some guilt trip. I always chuckle at her, take the leash, and place it up a little higher, hoping next time she won’t be able to reach it. Her eyes sometimes get me, though: pitiful puppy eyes. She’s such a good actress. She has become less enthusiastic over time, as if to say to me that she’s lost hope that I’ll ever take her on a walk. She beckons with the leash, nudging my hand with her wet nose, almost trying to force it into my hand to make sure I use it. I guess I finally gave in. I used the leash just an hour ago.

I’m the only one here. I just woke up…but now I think I’ll go back to sleep. It’s too quiet here.


“A gunshot wound to the head, inflicted with a shotgun. It was pretty gruesome. He was in his own bed.”

Another rather large and husky man shuffled some papers on the desk. “But that’s not all…?”

“No, unfortunately. We thought he was alone in the house at first, but then we returned and investigated.”

“And?” The chief of police rubbed his eyes, weary with the weight of a long (and looking to be even longer) day.

“He wasn't alone. We found his wife’s body stuffed into the washing machine in the basement. It looks like she was suffocated with some bed sheets. He…turned on the washer after his wife was all inside.”

“What the hell?”

“Then an older gentleman, about 75 years old, who we presume to be his father. Well, actually, we only found the remains of him. His limbs were all severed, along with his head, and his torso was bifurcated. Relatively cleanly, I might add, as if with an axe. We found the remains of the father in the fireplace, partly charred. The guy lit a match and threw it in with him. Looks like the hair was set on fire first.”

“Jesus.”

“A younger guy, anywhere from 15 to 18 years old, his son. We found him in the guy’s car sitting in the garage. The car was on, and the kid’s hands were duct-taped to the steering wheel. His eyes were still open.”

“…”

“Finally, we found his dog. This is the…weirdest one. We found it several blocks down the street, followed by a trail of blood. It had its leash on, and all of its legs were amputated. It’s like the guy took it for a walk, only…it couldn’t walk.”

“Did this guy leave any kind of suicide note or…anything? Or was he just fucking insane?”

“Actually, we did find this note on his bed, written in shaky, uneven letters. We believe he wrote it just before he shot himself. It says, ‘They said I’d never use the shotgun.’”",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,black,True,t3_owa40,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/owa40/an_hour_ago/,

The figure in the window. It looks featureless, only skin on a human frame, and it’s pressing itself against the glass somehow. I don’t know how it got there, and I don’t know how to get rid of it.

   At first I thought it was a prank, a doll or mannequin that some jerks put there to scare me. But I realized as I walked out of my house to pull it away… it wasn’t there. I shrugged it off, thinking that someone had hidden it while I was talking through my door. But I went back in and looked out that same window, and it was looking in, staring at me. I walked aruond my house, yelling for whoever it was to come out, but no one was there. The thing is hairless and naked, and it didn’t look like it actually had eyes, or even a face at all. But its head is turned towards me when I enter the room. When I sit on my computer, I can feel its faceless hatred boring into my neck. But when I turn around, it’s innocently turned in a different direction.

   Finally on Thursday I tried to open the window, but it’s stuck. I think the thing’s hands are keeping it down. But I got a good look at its face. Its eyes and mouth are behind the skin, pushing outward.

It stared at me, smiling.

Of course, I screamed.

   I pulled back a fist and smashed it onto the glass, determined once and for all to get rid of the glaring monster. I know I’m strong enough. That glass should’ve cracked. But it didn’t. It shuddered under my hand, but it didn’t break. And that smile just got wider and wider and wider, until I thought its head would break in half. It raised its own hand and bashed the window with its palm. It was mocking me. But I saw the faintest crack begin to appear where it had hit, and I backed away. No way did I want that smile in the same room as me.

   So I got a roll of duct tape, and I started covering the window. I couldn’t look directly at it; I nearly shit my pants just knowing it was watching me. But I couldn’t help it, I took a quick glance at the skin covered face. A small peek.

It was angry.

   That grin was now a gaping frown full of teeth. The skin had ripped away from its mouth and I coul see down its cavernous throat. A menacing rumble started to fill the house, and that hairline crack began to spread like splintering ice. I pulled down the duct tape. The rumble stopped, the split skin healed over, and it began to smile again. Now it’s night, and the noise hasn’t started again. There are no sounds, no rumble, no crackling glass. Everything’s quiet now. I can feel its claws gripping the back of my chair. I can hear its skin stretching as it smiles.

In our neighborhood, a story had been going around for a very very long time about a man who used to dress as a clown and live in the woods. They say he snatches up children when no one is around and bring them to the woods. We all knew this was just a tactic to scare us kids, but whenever we went near the woods, we would always be uneasy. None of us would ever admit it though. 

One night in the summer, all of us were playing tag. It was a late time of the night and the only light was the dim street lamps that were switched on every night. Me, along with another kid were hiding under a car, parked next to the woods. I was terrified and I'm sure he was too. We sat under the car in silence, waiting for the one who was 'it' to find us. Minutes felt like hours under that car. We waited and waited but we were hidden to well. After about 5 minutes of us hiding there, we heard a honk. It was the kind of honk you hear from the nose of a clown when he squeezes it. I know you may think ""Oh it was just a car horn or bike."" 
No. The woods were thick and you could only go through them by foot. What we heard was the noise of a clown nose. We sprinted for our lives to get away from the woods. A kid hiding near us was running too. The three of us made it back to the group. They said they heard it too. That was the end of us playing at night for a long long time.

A few weeks later, some of us were exploring the woods. The sound of the horn still rang in our heads. As we walked the thick trails, the boy in front found a big red button. The kind of button on a clown's big baggie suit. I know it seems rediculous, and is almost certainly a prank or coincidence, but to this day.

Part One

I'm sitting here and it's almost 10:00pm. I haven't been able to sleep at all the last few nights because I'm absolutely horrified of what will happen as soon as I doze off. I tried telling my parents about what's been happening, but they don't believe me. My friends at school think I'm crazy. Not surprising. I'm sure I look like a zombie, with the bags under my eyes and poor posture. One of them even made a snarky comment saying, and I quote, ""You should go try out for The Walking Dead."" What an asshole. That's the last thing I want to hear right now.

At this point, you're probably wondering what the hell is going on. Well, it all started last week. I was up until around 12:00am one night watching a recorded episode of Game of Thrones. I started to drift off when Bran Stark was having one of his annoying little dreams. I usually fast forward through the monotonous parts, but I was feeling extremely fatigued and didn't have the energy to do so. Naturally, I don't remember much after falling asleep, but I do recall hearing a faint click and then the fuzz-like sound of my older TV shutting down. You see, I'm still using an old CRT television. I was planning on getting a newer one sometime this month, but at this point, I don't really give a shit about that anymore.

Now, it's odd that I heard these sounds because, for one, I was the only person in the house. My parents had gone away on a mini-vacation to one of their timeshares, so no one could have possibly turned off the tube. Additionally, I've never seen or heard my TV shut down by itself. It just doesn't happen. I've fallen asleep many times with it on and when I wake up, it is still on.

So, after rising from my slumber the next day, I noticed it was off but didn't give it much thought. I went about my business like always, skating off to school and afterwards hanging out with my crew at the mall for a few hours. The day was uneventful, like most other days, but that night was a totally different story.

After getting home from seeing a movie, I did a little homework... ok, let's not bullshit here. I haven't done homework since 10th grade. I basically sat my ass down by the computer and surfed the usual sites I go to each evening.

Wow! You know what? I just realized something. Maybe this is punishment. Maybe I'm being forced to suffer because of my inherent laziness and lack of motivation, responsibility... the list goes on and on. That has to be it.

Please excuse my ramblings. I mean, this may be the last thing I write. The way things have been going, I don't know what to expect next. This shit is either going to kill me or drive me insane. Before I continue, I'd just like to say that no matter what happens, I'm going to get this story out. I just hope I can articulate it well enough for you to understand. Please know that it’s hard for me to even write about this. I shudder at the very thought of it…

Ok, let’s continue. Later that night, after surfing the web for a bit, I clicked on the TV and flipped through the channels trying to find something interesting and entertaining to watch. Being alone in the house had never bothered me before, but for some reason, I was a little on edge this time around. I really had no idea why. My TV shutting down by itself the night before seemed insignificant; I mean things like that can be rationally explained. No need to be paranoid. Right?

After landing on National Geographic, I plopped down in bed and proceeded to get into a comfortable spot. It didn't take long before my eyelids became heavy; skating around town most of the day really tires you out, no matter how long you've been doing it. I quickly succumbed to my weariness and fell asleep.

I remember hearing the same click and fuzz-like sound shortly after knocking out. Normally, I probably wouldn't have awoken, but the TV turned on again. It blasted a deafening, static-filled noise at full volume and the screen flashed erratically, lighting up my room like a strobe light would. I quickly reached for the remote with one hand and covered my ear with the other. It was so loud and bright; almost unbearable.

I mashed the power button on the remote, but the damn thing wouldn't turn off. The blaring noise filled my house and echoed off the walls. I jumped out of bed and tried the power switch on the TV itself, but that didn't work either. Panicking, I reached behind the box and yanked the cord from its outlet. Luckily that worked. At this point, my heart was racing so hard, it was difficult to maintain my composure. I put a hand on my forehead and leaned down a bit, trying to calm down. After a few moments, I looked around my room. All was quiet and it was pitch dark, but my retinas still burned from the flashes of light. Now you would think I'd have a hard time falling asleep again after that, but I was still somewhat groggy. I had to wake up early the next day so I climbed into bed, casting off the previous event as some sort of glitch. It was far from that, though.

You know, it's interesting how in many horror movies there is usually quite a bit of build-up and suspense before the main event. You get so involved in the story, sometimes you forget there's a scare lurking around the next corner. I wish this applied to my circumstance. It would have at least eased me into the situation and what was to come. You see, there wasn't a whole lot of ""build-up"" or sugarcoating. This shit hit me like a train after that whole TV incident.

I must have woken up a few hours later. The room was still dark, but my sight was well adjusted, unlike before. Oh god, I tremble even thinking about what happened next.

Let me preface by saying that I've had sleep paralysis before and it truly is frightening how, in most cases, you can't move anything except for your eyes. You are literally frozen in place and at the mercy of whatever malevolent beings prowl in the darkness.

This was NOT sleep paralysis. I had full control over every limb of my body. The thing is… I couldn’t move regardless. There was someone sitting on my chest, looking down at me. It was a full-sized man. I could only see his silhouette, but I knew he was staring at me. The absolute terror I felt at that moment is indescribable. I could feel his breath on my face, his mouth obviously open.

He sat there motionless for the first few moments, like a statue or mannequin. I wanted to yell and scream, but my fear had left me unable to even blink. And then, he unexpectedly…

Damn it. There’s a knock at my door. It’s okay - this has happened before. I just need to be real quiet now. I promise I’ll post the rest soon.

Lord, please do not let me fall asleep again. I beg you...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Part Two

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The knocking on my door continued for well over two hours. It has happened before, but never for that long. I turned off my computer and hid under my covers, like a coward. I'm still shaking, to be honest. I could see the shadow of his feet underneath the door. It HAD to be him. There's no one else here, you see. You understand, don't you? Nobody believes me. You do, right?

I will try my best to continue where I left off. When I was lying in bed, with him sitting on my chest staring at me, I couldn't move. Not a single muscle. I was so stricken with fear and dread, I was essentially frozen still. Absolutely rigid. He continued to stare down at me for what seemed like eternity, but then suddenly and without notice he jumped, pushing off of my chest. The pressure was intense, as if my whole torso was being compressed.

As I gasped for air, I saw him land on the floor beside my bed. His shadowy silhouette concealed his identity, but I knew he was staring at me.

Still in dismay, all I could do was watch as he scurried away through my bedroom door and into the hallway. He was on all fours, like a fucking animal. I've never seen a human being move like that, except maybe in The Exorcist.

Oh god, I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can continue. That was just the first night. Four days ago. I've been forcing myself to stay up since then, but I’ve been unsuccessful a few times. Every time I slip up and nap, he shows up again. Each time more intense than the last.

What the hell does he want? To torment me? Scare the shit out of me? Well, it's working. IT'S WORKING, YOU HEAR!!

I just want to scream at the top of my lungs. Curse him to hell. But, I'm afraid it'll make him angry.

Shhh. Did you hear that? Fuck, I thought I heard something. He doesn't come when I'm wide awake. I hope I'm not hearing things. Don't people start to hallucinate when they're sleep deprived?

Jesus, I'm rambling again. I just need to stay awake until my parents come home. They'll make everything ok. I'm stuck in my room until then.

I just need to sttaaa… shit. I just needd to staayy awakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Damn, that was close. I almost drifted off again. It's really hard to concentrate right now. I need to focus. Come on man, you can do this. I'm going to have to write more later...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Part Three

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh god. Oh god oh god oh god. He came again. I fucking fell asleep. He... he hurt me this time. I can feel the blood streaming down my back. I don't know how many cuts he made, but it was excruciating. I wailed, begging for mercy.

He didn't listen, though. Of course he didn't. He's here to torture me. At first, I thought he wanted to just rile me up; scare me to death. Every time he came, he was just sitting there, motionless. Staring.

Now... now I know the truth. He wants to kill me. He's going to kill me slowly and painfully.

Jesus, my back hurts so bad. I'm afraid to look at it in the mirror; to see what he carved. What kind of sick person does this??

Right now, I'm sitting here in total darkness. The power is off, but thankfully I have my laptop. I'm going to finish this story, as promised, but my battery is running low and I don't know how much time I have left.

I'm going to look in the mirror using the screen's light. I have to. I need to see what he did to my skin. Hold on...

What the...? What the fuck?? It says something. He etched words into my back. I can't believe this shit.

Ok, calm down. Breathe.

It was really hard to read, but I think it says, ""Close your eyes, it's your demise."" I... wha… what does it mean? Lord help me. Please help me.

I need to stay awake; just for a bit longer. I need to keep my eyes open and stop myself from nodding off. But how? I'm trapped in this room. I can't leave. I can't splash water on my face or drink caffeine. All I have is my mind and this laptop with its waning battery level.

I know he's out there in the hallway. He's just waiting for me to mess up and fall asleep again.

My parents won't be back until later tonight. It's only a few more hours, but right now hours seem like days. God, this is torture in itself. I can't stand it anymore.

I'm going to needd to figguree somthinng outt. I havvee to sttay awakkkke.

Damn it, I'm dozing off again. Urgghh. Think man, think. What can I do to keep my eyes open? Ah, I can listen to music or watch something. Yes!! Wait. My battery is at 19% now. Shit, that isn't going to work.

What else is there? What elsse cann I doo

Oh god, I can't stay awake. I cann't. I hearr somethinng. It's a creakkingg noisse. It's tthe doorr

I'm sorrry momm. Sorry dadd. I… I nee… I jusst needd to sleeepppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

This is what I have. An irrational feeling of terror that originates from seeing my reflection. What you are about to read is not fiction. It’s not a story meant to creep you out, but a warning for those who are still unaware of this fact. 

What is your reflection? Science has told us that it’s an image created in our brain from light that reflects off a mirror or another reflecting object. This would mean that whatever you do, your reflection will do identically. But a reflection isn’t actually bound to do what you do. It can refuse to mimic your movement, it has a will of its own. You may think I’m mad, but I can assure you that I’m not. I wouldn’t believe any of this either, had I not seen it with my own eyes. It happened when a friend was spending the night at my house, many years ago. We were playing some games late at night, lights off in a complete darkness. The only light source was the faint glow of the tv-screen. Me and my friend were getting hungry, so he offered to make us some food while I kept playing. He went over to the fridge and switched the light on in the kitchen. There was a round mirror in the living-room where I was playing, positioned in a manner that allowed me to see his reflection as he was standing in front of the fridge. He made some sandwiches and asked me what I wanted on mine. I turned my head slightly, so that I could see the mirror and his reflection. He was looking at me through the mirror, holding in one hand butter and in the other jelly. I said I’d take jelly, and he put his hands down, but kept staring at me. I stared back for a bit, thinking this was some joke he was trying to pull (he used to do that a lot) but his face looked serious, almost angry. After a while, I heard steps from behind me, so I swung around to face whatever was approaching. It was my friend.

He gave me a weird look as an answer to my scared expression. I was sure that just a second ago he had been looking at me from the fridge, there was no way he could have made those sandwiches and walked over to me. I heard the footsteps as I was looking at his reflection! How was this possible? I was really weirded out and thought I was going crazy. I didn’t say anything to him as I didn’t want to seem like an idiot, but looking back, maybe I should have. We ate and played for a while, then we went to sleep. We were sleeping in separate rooms, across the hall from eachother. I couldn’t sleep, I was still thinking about what I saw. I was up for a good half an hour and nothing happened. Then, I heard a noise coming from down the hall. It was like a choking sound, but muffled. I got up carefully, I didn’t want to make a sound. Maybe it was a robber that had somehow gotten inside. I kept a wooden sword next to my bed (weird, I know. I was always a bit paranoid) so I took it with me. I walked as quietly as possible down the hall, the sound had come from the kitchen, I’m sure. As I came to the end of the hall, I saw movement in the mirror in the living-room. I turned my head to face the mirror, and felt like the floor had fallen from beneath my feet. There was my reflection, holding its finger to its mouth, gesturing me to be quiet. It was dark, but I could clearly see a sinister grin on its face as it proceeded to point with its other hand.

It was pointing behind me. I didn’t know if I wanted to turn around, but I did. I scanned the darkness behind me, looking for something out of the ordinary, but there was nothing there. Just the doors to my room, and to the room where my friend was sleeping. His door was open. His door was open? It wasn’t open when I came out into the hallway. I swallowed, and approached his room. It was dark inside, even darker than the hallway. I called out his name, no answer. I approached him to see if he was still there, and laid my hand on the bed. I was glad to feel him there (I don’t know what I expected) and shook him a bit. No answer. I shook him more, almost aggressively. Still no answer. I moved over to the door, and switched the lights on. He was lying there, staring at me with his still, dead eyes. He had choked. I ran down the hall to call an ambulance, and I will never forget what faced me. In the mirror was my reflection, as well as my friend’s. I didn’t stop, I just ran to get the phone.

After the incident, I started doing research on mirrors and different rumors surrounding them. I found some cases that were similar to what happened that night. Cases where the only witness claimed that a mirror killed the victim. Most times the witness had been arrested as the culprit, which made me happy that I hadn’t mentioned anything of the sorts to the officers who had questioned me. I found something which I believe might be relevant in finding out why the reflections had done this (and I’m sure they had). In some cultures, mirrors are believed to have the ability of sucking out a person’s soul. They feed on the person’s soul. I think they need to kill them to get the full soul, though. This is why my friend was killed. And this is why I’m warning you. Don’t stay alone with mirrors around. You never know when we get hungry.

At least I thought it was standard. Woke up around 10:00, washed my face and brushed my teeth. Got dressed and went to the kitchen. I had just started living on my own, and I had a little apartment in a slightly rural area. I could see the woods from my kitchen window. I toasted some bread and lathered some cheap butter on. Poured a glass of milk, took one sip and realized it was sour. Great. I finished my crappy breakfast and left for work. 
Hours later, Im driving home at 9 after working two hours of over time. Its a standard desk job, so I was bored as hell, and I had let my imagination run amok. 
There weren't any streetlights on my way back from work, so all I had were the headlights from my '98 volvo to guide me. I'm about twenty minutes to home when the car dies. I don't kow much about cars, and luckly I have three bars on my tracfone. I call AAA and they say it'll be an hour before they get to me. I hang up the phone, and unbuckle my seatbelt. I wasn't getting out of the car, I was just stretching out. Before I know it, I'm being woken up by the ringing of my cell.
""Hello?""
""Hi, this is AAA, you called earlier about your car,DQT-4356?""
""Uh, yeah that's my License Plate."" 
""It's going to be a- "" Then the Line goes dead. I'm almost out of battery, so I turn on the light to look for the charger. 
I didn't notice the blood. Not at first. The light only barely illuminated it on the other side of the front window. A small trail sliding down to the hood of the car. I couuldn't tell what it was, so I decided to climb out and check. I wasn't afraid. I've lived in the area for years. My parents live down the road, but due to my anger at them, I didn;t wait there for AAA. I  looked at the window, and saw that it was indeed blood. I look up to see it. A tall, what I believed to be a man, hanging from the tree. His once pristine white plants and shirt streaked black, it was hard to tell, but it was most definately blood. I wasn't waiting here anymore. I grabbed my phone, and charger, put them in my book bag, and took off for my parents. I was 100 yards away, when the prickling on my neck started. I glanced behind me. about ten feet back was a sall humanoid figure. Taller than normal, long spindly arms, legs, and neck. Wearing a black italian suit. It's face was blurry, I couldn't see any features on it what so ever. I looked forewards and started to run. He was there. I ran right into him. His arms were outstretched to recieve me in a cold embrace. I slipped out and ran again. I looked up to the sky in despiration, and saw them. All around were people, men and women in white, hanging from the trees. I recognized my parents hanging from the tree in their front yard. I run past them, into the house and into my old room. I locked all the doors. Still, his tall form filled my bedroom door soon enough. I jumped out the window, and ran back for the street. Just then a car appeared. 
""Help!"" I called. They pulled over, it was AAA. I told them waht happened and for them to call the police, but the bodies were gone. They towed my car, and gave me a ride to the station, where the police took my story. I stayed there the rest of the night. 

I moved soon afterwards. Out of state, changed jobs and my last name. My parents bodies were never recovered, and but none of the bodies were. I'm only sharing this because from the window of this computer room, I see a white shape hanging from the trees across the road, and behind, I see a tall man in black.

1341880105.0,38,self.creepypasta,wats7,Quiet - A War Story,roterghost,41,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/wats7/quiet_a_war_story/,"I never saw the ocean till I was nineteen, and if I ever see it again it will be too goddamn soon. I was a child, coming out of the train, fresh from Amarillo, into San Diego and all her glory. The sight of it, all that water and the blind crushing power of the surf, filled me with dread. I’d seen water before, lakes, plenty big, but that was nothing like this. I don’t think I can describe what it was like that first time, and further more, I’m not sure I care too.

You can imagine the state I was in when a few weeks later they gave me a rifle and put me on a boat. When I stopped vomiting up everything that I ate, I decided that I might not kill myself after all. Not being able to see the land, and that ceaseless chaotic, rocking of the waves; I remember thinking that the war had to be a step up from this. Kids can be so fucking stupid.

I had such a giddy sense of glee when I saw the island, and it’s solid banks. They transferred us to a smaller boat in the middle of the night, just our undersized company with our rucksacks and rifles and not a word. We just took a ride right into it, just because they asked us to. The lieutenants herded us into our platoons on the decks and briefed us: the island had been lost. That was exactly how he put it. Somehow in the grand plan for the Pacific, this one tiny speck of earth, only recently discovered and unmapped, had gotten lost in the shuffle; a singularly perfect clerical error was all it took. It was extremely unlikely, he stressed, that the Japanese had gotten a hold of it, being so far east and south of their current borders, but a recent fly over reported what looked like an airfield in the central plateau.

We hit the beach in the middle of the night. I’d heard talk of landings before, and I’m not ashamed to tell, I was scared shitless. I don’t know quite what I expected, but it wasn’t we got, that thick, heavy silence. Behind the lapping of the waves and the wind in the trees, there was… nothing, no birds, no insects. Just deathly stillness.


Another hundred yards deeper into the eerie tranquility of the jungle, we stopped in a small clearing for the officers to reconvene, and it was obvious even they were spooked. I wasn’t a bright kid, but I knew enough to know that something was very wrong. It was like the whole island was dead. I remember I could only smell the sea, despite the red blossoms dangling from the trees.

It wasn’t an airfield, on top of the plateau. I can’t tell you what it was, because I’ve never seen anything like it, and I don’t think anyone ever will. If I tell you it was like the Aztec pyramids, but turned upside down, so that it sank like giant steps into the earth, you’d get the basic idea of it, but that somehow fails to capture the profound unearthliness of the structure.

There was no sign of individual pieces in the masonry, it appeared to have been carved out of a single immense block of black rock into a sharp and geometric shape. It was slick and perfectly smooth like obsidian, but it had no shine to it. It swallowed up even the moonlight, so that it was impossible to see how deep it went, or even focus your eyes on any one part of it, like it was one giant blind spot.

Our platoon drew the honor of investigating the lower levels, so we descended the stairs as the rest of the company surrounded the plateau. We took the stairs slowly and carefully after the first man to touch one of the right angle edges slit his hands down the bone.

At odd intervals down the steps, there were several small stone rooms; simple, empty, hollow cubes of stone with one opening, facing the pit in the center. There was no door that we could see, and with the opening being four feet of the ground, you’d have to put your hands on that black razor sharp edge to climb in into it.

We circled the descending floors, shining our lights into each of the small structures; They contained the same featureless black walls and nothing else. No dust, no leaves and other detritus from the jungle, the whole monument was immaculate, as if the place was just built; but that couldn’t be right. The whole structure felt incalculably old to me somehow, despite having no way to articulate the particular reasons.

Down near the bottom you could see that it simply sloped away into a darkness that swallowed the flashlights. We tossed first a button and then a shell casing down into the pit, and waited in the unearthly silence, but no sounds returned. No one spoke, we simply turned away from the yawning abyss and continued our sweep of the bottom rung and the last of the small structures.

The body in the back corner was almost invisible at first in the thick shadows, but the long spill of drying blood reflected the light of our flashlights, and it led right too him. He was coiled tight, arms around his thighs, and his face tucked into his knees. You could see badly he was cut, his clothes opened in ragged bloody tatters to reveal the pale skin and bone beneath it. He may have been dressed in a Japanese uniform, but it had been reduced to ribbons; I only had few seconds to look at him before we heard the first shots.

It echoed like the buzzing of faraway insects in the still jungle, swallowed almost instantly by the blanket of quiet. By the time we reached the top, the rest of the company had vanished. There were shell casings on the ground, and the hot smell of gunpowder in the air, but they were gone. The trees were deathly quiet around, there was not a trace of the nearly fifty other men that had come ashore with us. I could taste bile rising in my throat as panic threatened to cripple me; I felt crushed between the yawning pit and razor edges on one side and the dead jungle and the pounding ocean on the other. The silence rang in my ears and I struggled to still myself.

They were just inside the jungle, waiting for us. They came out from between the trees with all sound of a moth, simply sliding into our view.

I can try to tell you what I saw, the same as I did to the army doc on the hospital ship when I first woke up, and again half dozen other various officers over the following months, and you’ll have the same reaction they did; that I was a dumb country rube suffering from heatstroke and exposure and trauma. That I was crazy.

You know me. You know I’m not crazy. And I remember every second of that night with crystal clarity.

The thing, the first one that caught my eye, was wearing the skin of a Jap soldier, all mottled with the belly distended from rot. The head drooped, useless and obscene on the shoulders, tongue swollen and eyes cloudy. I could see where it was coming apart at the ill-defined joints, with ragged holes in the drying flesh. At the bottom of each of these raw pits was blackness, deeper than the stones of the buildings; a darkness that seemed to churn and froth like an angry cloud.

The thing moved suddenly, the head snapping and rolling backwards as it dashed towards us. I had my rifle clasped tightly in my hands, but it simply didn’t occur to me to fire. All I could do was gape silently at the macabre sight bearing down on us, and think absurdly of my mother’s marionettes.

A gun went off beside me, and I turned to see a dozen more of the horrors darting silently in on us. Among them were a few more rotting and swollen forms, but the majority wore the same uniforms as us, and were pale, fresh, and soaked in blood. More bullets zipped through the air, and I saw the grisly things hit again and again, but they never slowed. I caught a glimpse of the First Sergeant’s vacant glassy eyes as his head dangled limp from his shoulders; I saw the great ragged wound in his back and the shuddering darkness that inhabited his corpse when he leapt just past me without a sound, landing like a graceful predator onto the soldier beside me. The others around me began to drop in a silent dance of kinetic energy and blurred motion

I was on the track team in high school, and it could have got me to college. I didn’t need an invitation. I just ran. I ran blind through jungle, caroming of tree trunks; I ran until I saw the ocean, and it struck a new ringing note of terror in me. I don’t remember actually deciding to swim, but when I turned back to the tree line, I saw one of the white and bloody things emerge, running on all fours, the hands splayed wide and the back contorted and cracked in an impossible angle.

To this day, the mere thought of the ocean still brings on a cold sweat, but that night I let it embrace me, let the tide drag me out to sea, if only to bring momentary relief from the impossible monolith and terrors on the island. The days I spent drifting off shore and blistering in the sun were a welcome release from the silent island.

I never saw the war. They sent me home as soon as I recovered.

It was comforting in a way, when I thought no one believed me. It allowed me to believe that it never happened, that it was a product of my mind. But as I got older, I’ve found that it is pointless to lie to anyone, especially yourself. I know what I saw.

Someone else believed me too. I’ve seen maps of where they tested the hydrogen bombs in the South Pacific.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_wats7,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/wats7/quiet_a_war_story/,

Pale skin, dark, sunken eyes, elongated faces, sharp teeth, and the like. These images inspire horror and revulsion in many, and with good reason. The characteristics shared by these faces are imprinted in the human mind.

Many things frighten humans instinctively. The fear is natural, and does not need to be reinforced in order to terrify. The fears are species-wide, stemming from dark times in the past when lightning could mean the burning of your tree home, thunder could be the approaching gallops of a stampede, predators could hide in darkness, and heights could make poor footing lethal.

The question you have to ask yourself is this:

What happened, deep in the hidden eras before history began, that could effect the entire human race so evenly as to give the entire species a deep, instinctual, and lasting fear of pale beings with dark, sunken eyes, razor sharp teeth, and elongated faces?

1366088824.0,39,self.creepypasta,1cfzy9,Reading the Stall Graffiti,rorygilliams,45,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1cfzy9/reading_the_stall_graffiti/,"Public restrooms have always been your worst nightmare. They are absolutely
gross with the many smells of the disgusting bodily functions that occur within them.
Unless it's a five-star restaurant, and even then they can be sketchy, they tend to
be on the bad side. Generally, they are all automatic toilets, and due to a traumatic
experience as a small child, you believe automatic toilets will suck you in if they flush
as you are on the toilet. The graffiti that is on the stalls can occasionally be funny,
but most of the time, they cross the line between funny and just plain wrong. You 
can't forget the gross sinks that have soap scum and other leftover residue that is 
displeasing to the eyes. You also remember one time when you swore you saw a rat or
a mouse run across the floor of some random gas station bathroom. You absolutely
hate them.


Nevertheless, you get sucked into an eight hour long road trip with your friends
where, for some idiotic reason, you all decide to play a drinking game using water. 
Since you just suck, you lose many, many times, and you drink about a gallon of water
within two hours of the trip. Desperation kicks in as your bladder fills to the brim. You
immediately rule out peeing in a bottle or stopping on the side of the road. Your friends
are also total jerks as they begin to describe every single form of water there is to 
entice your need to pee. Although you wish to threaten all of them with horrible deaths,
you must focus your attention on not peeing. Luckily, your friends actually have souls as
they find the next rest stop and pull over to let you pee.


Even though you hate public restrooms, you burst into it without a thought in the
world. It's not the best one you've seen, but it's also not the worst. There is a stink to 
it, but it's faintly covered by cleaning supplies. It seems as though one of the previous 
occupants was recently here because of the odor. The floor is rather unclean, and the
stalls look beaten down and worn out with the black paint chipping off it. The sinks look
the worst to you, although you haven't seen the toilets. The soap scum really disgusts
you, and there seems to be some white liquid concentrated in one area of the counter.
You immediately turn away to halt any chances of something else coming out of your 
system. Finally, you enter the stall, pull down your pants, and empty your bladder. What
a relief.


Since it is taking a while, you read the graffiti hoping that there's some good tidbits 
of information that you can give to your friends before you kill them. You first look to the 
right, and you see a conversation. It reads as followed:


""I want you to know that you are now manually pooping.""
""I want YOU to know that you are now manually blinking.""
""I am going to hurt you.""
""Why? The person is just a troll. If you ignore it, the troll's power will die.""
""Okay, Mr. Cool Head. Get your logical nonsense out of this here stall today. I don't 
want any of this while I poop.""


You let out a chuckle and are mildly surprised by the excellent grammar in this toilet 
stall. You turn your head to the left to see if there's a sequel to this intriguing story. All you 
see is:


""Have a &lt;blank&gt; day.""


The third word is completely scratched out. The only thing you can do is guess what 
it originally said. In the middle of thinking of the top choices to fit into the sentence, you 
hear a scratching noise that is coming from the left of you. Something is carving a word above 
the sentence right in front of your eyes. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. Ironically, your first thought is ""Well, 
that wasn't one of my guesses"", and it immediately transitions into ""WHAT JUST DID THAT?"" 
Although you only came in here to pee, your bowels practically open the gates of hell and unleash
unto the mighty porcelain the armies of your breakfast and lunch. You cannot regain control as
your heart rate increases and panic ensues. Your breathing becomes shallow and short as you 
struggle to gain control of your lungs. However, in all this panic, you notice on the right stall wall 
that the previous conversation has been partially scratched out. The only words that remain are:


""I want you to know""
""That you are""
""Going to""
""Die""
""Today""


Tears start flowing from your eyes like Niagara Falls, and you realize that you cannot speak 
at all. Then, you look straight ahead at the stall door. It simply reads:


""Goodbye :)""


A piercing scream unleashes within the bathroom. You want to cover your ears, but you find 
yourself to be paralyzed. The screeching stops. Everything stops. You remain paralyzed, and you sit 
in silence for what feels like ten minutes. A voice penetrates the silence. ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11."" At the last number, the stall door burst opens. You feel a pain in your chest that feels as if 
hundreds of nails were simultaneously nailed into you, and in a flash, you feel nothing.

Of course you have. We all have. And isnt it just a faboulus sentence. It raises so many questions. Who is watching you? Why is it watching you? And it gives you  an erri feeling that someone is in fact standing outside your window or even outside your bedroom door.  To be honest it gave me a small chill after i wrote that.  When you shower and you get soap in your eyes, do you panic and try to whipe it off as fast as you can? Just because you think there is going to be a horrible creature standing right in front of you? Or when you brush your teeth, and you bow your head to spit the toothpaste, do you think someone is going to stand behind you when you look in the mirror? Why do we react this way? Do you think it's all that late night horror movies that give you cheap scares? Past experiences? Or are we all just paranoid from time to time? Growing up I was a bit of a coward, Halloween masks scared me, no not your average "" wow that is scary"" and move on. I could not be in the same room that had some sort of mask in it. I was even afraid of those full body teddybear costumes or maskot costumes. I hid under a table once long story short, my family was at a hotel and at breakfast a guy dressed as a tiger comes in and i freak out. This was my peek, the moment in time when i was scared the most. Over the years I have slowly learn to deal with it. But every time i see something like a mask or teddybear now It still haunts me and will always bring back memories and the same emotions. Humans like getting horribly scared. It's in our nature, survival bullshit or something.  We like to see what we can handle in terms of fear. How far we can push ourselfe. Nothing wrong with that. In my recent years i have grown to love horror movies they don't scare me at all because I know it's just a movie. Im not going to try and make up some bullshit ghost story because frankly it would just be to over ambitious and anticlimatic. Instead I will tell you about some of my most horrible nightmares i have ever had. I can still remember them clear as day. This first reacuring nightmare I had when I was a kid is something terrifying indeed and pretty fucked up to have at a young age in my opinion. The dream starts up with me in my bedroom I had a fairly small bedroom, it's pitch black, I go outside my room and slowly down the stairs. As I walk down I see a silluette of a man or beast. Standing in front of the last step. It is saying something I keep walking towards it, it backs away in to the livingroom and i get sucked in to what ever it is like a black hole then I wake up. This might not sound scary to you but to me it's terrible. My next dream is also a recurring nightmare. I was being chased by a man screaming "" im going to kill you"" this man was really fast and was moving like a shadow. I keept waking up when I heard his voice behind me almost whispering "" im going to kill you"". This scared me alot and one night I had this dream again. He was chaseing me through my house i run up to my bathroom and I hide in the bathtub, the man or figure enters the bathroom and walks up to me. The funny thing about this is that the man was dressed as a tomato, i say to him"" get out of my dreams!"" The man looks sad and walks out and I wake up and haven't have that dream ever since. Nightmares is what really scares me. Not horror movies or ghosts. Nightmare is also used to describe something like"" traffic was a nightmare"" the fact that nightmare is the word we use to describe something that is beyond what we can control is scary. And that nightmares are what everyone fears when they go to bed. Some nights I don't want to go to sleep because im afraid of dreaming. To wrap this up someone or something is waiting for you, watching you in your dreams and when you sleep. You are never alone. Mabye someone is under your bed or in your closet. Just waiting and watching. Here is an image, imagine you going to sleep and waking up. Its dark but you can see a little. You see a head coming up from the side of your bed slowly you see the hair first then the eyes mouth slowly standing up over your bed . The creature does not do anything just standing over you.

I know that sound melodramatic and maybe even a little cliché, but I've tried looking for a better definition and everything came up short. I've tried to keep myself together, I really did, but some things you don't just walk away from and brush off.

Not the things I've seen. Not after what it did to me.

I don't know what's haunting me. I don't know where it came from, I don't know what it wants, but that doesn't frighten me like it used to. No, what scares me isn't the fact that I know nothing about this thing, it's that I don't know how long it's been haunting me.

I still see its slender arms. I see them in the trees outside my window. All the time.

It all happened back a few years ago. I had been visiting my friend in the hospital after she tried to kill herself. I was walking down one of the wings when I saw it out the window- it was a man in a suit. I only saw the shoulders and I only saw it for just long enough to not register it before it had disappeared. I don't remember the face, I don't remember the color of his suit. I looked away and when it clicked in my head that a man wasn't supposed to be outside the window, I turned back and saw nothing. I dismissed it and told myself I was stressed out and imagining things- I was dealing with my best friend, after all.

The second time occurred a few weeks later after that same friend died in the hospital. Doctors never gave the cause of death aside from ""complications"". I didn't ask questions, but when I look back, I know it was bullshit. 

She looked terrible at her funeral- so sad and grim, it wasn't like her to be mourned over when she lived a good life. That was when, amongst all in attendance, I saw it again- a man in a suit, but it wasn't that same man and it wasn't that same suit, if that makes any sense. If not, well, it didn't make sense to me, either.

It wasn't a suit worn to a funeral- it wasn't the kind of person to attend the funeral, either, but when I looked at the man who didn't belong, I felt like I'd been lifted back up to the hospital and was staring at the man out the window again. I tried to make contact- I tried to address it, I tried to get its attention after the funeral, but once the proceedings were over, it just passed us by. It came so close to me- inches. I'd never felt so cold as when that thing passed by me.

I followed it- my mistake. I wanted to know who the man was and how he knew my friend. I wasn't far behind, but then I saw him walking straight from the funeral parlor and into some nearby woods. I told myself not to- I fucking told myself not to go, but I went. I watched the suit walk in through the trees and I followed it. It had gotten far into the forest before it turned to look at me.

I was petrified- I saw someone completely different than the man in the funeral. Was this the wrong man? Did I follow some stranger into the forest who had nothing to do with anything else? I wanted to believe it, but I kept feeling like nothing about this man belonged.

It was his face that frightened me so badly. I can't remember it, and you wouldn't, either. I want to say it had blonde hair, but then my memories tell me that it was black- maybe it was a ginger, or something. And then I think about the skin; was it light, or dark skin? Every time I try to draw it and make a template, I might guess at the skin color, but once I've got that down, I remember it completely different.

I can't keep it in my eyes, in my mind. I can't keep its face, or its features in my head. Was it a long, or a short nose? Chinese eyes, or Korean? Puffy lips, or pursed? Did it smile? Did it frown? Did it glare with the eyes I can't remember?

I trailed it through the forest and almost screamed when it looked back. I don't remember much of what happened next- I remember it standing over me in its suit that didn't quite belong in the forest, either. I know that doesn't make sense- no suit belongs in the forest, but this one? The suit it wore begged to get out. I remember seeing it above me. I'd fallen down and laid there while it stood over me- it had limbs that went on forever. I tried looking to my left and right, but I had to stop tracing its sleeves when I neck wouldn't stretch far back enough. I tried to stare into its face, but again, nothing.

I woke up at home and spent the entire morning crying. I hoped it was a dream- I wanted to believe it was all just an elaborate trick of the mind I could move on from, but I knew better. I remember the crisp leaves under my shoulders, I remember the pine wood of the casket and I remember the struggle I had when I tried to put a face to the suit, and suit to the face. I could picture none of it- it was like trying to remember something you could see only in your peripheral vision- something you couldn't identify, but stays on the tip of your tongue. 

Every day for the next two weeks I had nightmares about what I'd seen. Each time I'd find myself in the woods at some time of the day- I'd fall down, and when I turned up to the sky, I'd see it. I'd see the suit and the monster who's been sitting at the tip of my tongue. Sometimes the dreams would be set in the day- it would look like a figure with long limbs that stretched impossible lengths, but sometimes, at night, those limbs branched like a tree in every direction- each branch had a smaller branch and so on, like some terrible fractal illusion from hell.

Each time, I saw the same face, but I saw a different face. I saw a face from my peripheral vision, even when I looked straight ahead at the creature. I tried focusing- I tried to tell myself to pay attention to its features and record them to memory... I told myself over and over, but nothing. I can remember the birthdays and anniversaries of all my ex-boyfriends, but I couldn't remember that fucking monster's face.

I quit my job, my friends stopped calling, I stopped getting emails... I stopped getting mail. I tried to joke that I wouldn't have bills to worry about, but I would've loved someone to know I was there. I cut myself off to the world and the slender man made me do it. I couldn't let anyone see me like this; always crying, always watching my back, staring intently at everything I see to make sure it's real... I couldn't let them see their beloved friend in this state. I wouldn't, so I just dropped off the map.

The next time I saw it was a few days after the dreaming stopped. It was when I was making a desperate move to go shopping. I'd run out of food, pads, and everything else. I tried to keep my head down and just stare at my hands as often as possible, but when I was walking through the grocery store, I saw it. It was pushing a shopping cart, casually passing me in the bread isle... It wore a suit that didn't belong there, but I wasn't worried about the suit anymore.

How long had this been going on? How long have I been missing this guy? How many times had it walked right by me without even noticing? How did I let myself live so unguarded from this thing? All it did was pass me in the grocery store and I had to take off running with a loaf of bread, sobbing all the way home. I spent the rest of the week crying- eating my loaf of bread and crying. I wanted to un-see it, but I couldn't. I can never undo what this thing did to me.

After the first night of sleep without nightmares in over a month, I was feeling good- I thought that I might've beaten it, or at least eluded it. I was feeling ready for the first healthy day, but aside from that... I was feeling ready.

I had a camera, my cell camera and an old Polaroid. I looked like an idiot going on a walk through the park with it all, but it paid off- I saw it walking. I saw it walking just off the stone path, stepping along the grass. I didn't think- I didn't try to look at its face or make guesses as to what its features were like. I raised up my camera, but a red, blinking light flashed and the camera died. I raised up my cell phone, but when I pressed the camera button, the battery light blinked and I got no power. The Polaroid, though... The Polaroid did the job.

I snapped a picture and went home triumphant. I don't know why, but I felt victorious toward the slender man with the face and suit that didn't belong. I kept my camera hidden until I got home, I turned on the lights and I looked at the photo.

I wish I hadn't looked at the photo.

It had no face- where there were nose, eyes, mouth, ears, or even curves of the brow and cheeks, there was a solid mass of... something. The photo strained and ached as it tried to figure out if the creature had two arms, or ten million, each branching off from the last arm. The suit didn't belong in any photograph- it bled. The photo struggled to read everything to me- was it bleeding from the pockets, or gashes along the fabric? Was it made of blood entirely? All I saw was the suit, and I saw blood, but it's still on the tip of my tongue- I can't place the blood, no matter how hard I try.

The next morning I woke up and screamed at what I saw- I had a gash leading down my arm. I slept in a room with nothing but an air mattress and a plastic cup, and I had a long, bloody cut down my arm. 

I knew the slender man had done this. I'd changed the rules in a way I can't take back- I'd given the world evidence that this monster exists elsewhere besides the corner of their eyes. I changed the rules, and so did it- it can hurt me now.

It will kill me.

Back in the late Sixties, there existed a religious sect known as “The Process Church Of The Final Judgment.” Their core beliefs were that at the end of the world, Christ and Satan would come together, reconcile and begin to judge and execute the population. So, they worshipped both of them. While this information set people on edge, it did not deter people from becoming members of “The Process” and the church flourished throughout the sixties and seventies.

In that period, an increase was seen in missing children across the United Kingdom, the Mexican Yucatan peninsula and even in the state of New Orleans. Kids ranging from as young as 3 to as old as 10 were being taken on walks home, In their front yards and even sometimes from their homes In the dead of night. Bodies were rarely ever recovered. When they were...well let's just say it was quickly established that it would've been better for the families to simply hold out hope for a safe return. What was done to these children was simply horrifying, every unspeakable act you can possibly think of in order to inflict pain was carried out. All children left completely blind, with a look of indescribable pain and terror on their faces if any were discovered by the authorities or god forbid...passers by.

Due to the satanic panic raging throughout the United States and United Kingdom at the time, most information regarding Satanic cults or missing persons cases were kept under lock and key so as to not cause mass hysteria. One particular incident caused so much havoc, it was feared that if brought to the publics light, it would shock the nation to it's core.

On October 12th, 1975, A photograph was posted to the local authorities in 15 states in the USA &amp; 5 counties in the UK, all receiving the same image, the one you see accompanying this story (can be seen by checking out the CreepyPasta Wiki).

On October 13th, a normal middle class family in Essex was settling down for the night, when the father heard his son screaming from his room. As he darted upstairs, he found a man in a white lab coat, goggles and a modified gas mask towering over his frightened 7 year old son. The father reacted quickly and subdued the man before calling the authorities.

When he was brought in, he was identified as Rev. Michael Turnwell, though he had no records of ever living in the area, in fact the residence he was registered at was 300 miles away...what was he doing way out here? In his pockets, they found a bottle of chloroform, a rag, a switchblade knife and a small pocket book, filled from cover to cover with incomprehensible gibberish mixed in with citations from the Satanic verses, Diagetics &amp; The Old Testament. When asked what the hell he was doing with all these items and his purpose for that young boy, he simply smiled wide eyed and said “I'm doing Gods work...they needed to see the light...”

Under further interrogation it was revealed he was a member of the Church of The Process, he agreed to show the police where the children were being taken in exchange for protection. Assuring them all the while that “The Children are fine, they're with God now, they saw the light...”

Not fully understanding this vague reference, they persisted and got him to open up, this is what he told them:

“We knew that the children could be spared Judgment, for they do not understand sin, they are pure. But in order to be accepted into Gods loving arms, they first needed to see the light. So we subjected it to them with the God machine. Those that became blind or removed their goggles were...punished accordingly. Those that were not blinded were accepted into Gods flock, their souls escaping their bodies and their shells to be used as we saw fit, they were no longer harbouring any children...” He trailed off, giggling like a child.

“Those were our...toys to play with. And believe me, officers, we did enjoy our toys...even if they broke sometimes. Love the sin, hate the sinner.” He burst out laughing, the room seemingly shaking around him.

After a few moments, they asked him what happened to the children that turned around, as all the children positioned in this image were facing outwards. The Reverend gave a sick, twisted smile and said slowly, in an unnaturally deep voice:

“They are the ones who become part of HIS legion...who do you think carries on our work once some of us get caught or perish? We are everywhere, detective. We will bring all children to the light. You simply need to look West and you will know the face of evil.”

He suddenly leaned forward to intently stare at the detectives opposite him and asked sadistically “Tell me...do ''YOU'' have children?”

He was found dead in his cell the following morning, having concealed 
a cyanide cap in one of his teeth. Some weeks following, one of the officers involved in the case lost their child, a little boy. He simply vanished one day walking home from school, his body was never recovered.

Serial killers Fred &amp; Rose West were caught 19 years later on the 24th of February 1994 after a 20 year spree in which they raped &amp; killed more than 13 people, including their own children. When Fred was interrogated, he mentioned that 20 children were captured &amp; killed by himself, Rose and others he did not know of in a barn not too far from where they lived, when asked how he managed to capture all of them so easily, he simply smiled and said:

“It's easy, when you live directly next to a Church.”",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_vcxr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vcxr1/see_the_light_an_oc_creepypasta/,

This is an original pasta inspired by my own issues with sleep paralysis.


For as long as she could remember, Mary had always been afraid of the dark. But unlike other children who experienced similar nocturnal fears, Mary never “grew out” of it. Since she could dream, there was an element of terror in her nightmares that few people she knew shared. She learned through extensive therapy as an adult that the phenomenon she experienced that contributed the most to her fear of the dark was called “sleep paralysis.” 

“Basically, Mrs. Adams, your body is awake, but your mind is still dreaming and it can be terrifying for the mind to try to compensate for that. It can lead to hallucinations, panic attacks… a myriad of psychological eccentricities…” the psychologist trailed off as Mary leaned back in her chair. The Doctor, however condescending, was right. Mary had opened up to him about what she saw in that half-dream state and realized the nightmares and “hallucinations” as the Doctor called them, shared similar aspects she traced back to her childhood.

Mary, while recounting a nightmare from the previous night, was shaking when it came into her waking mind. 
“The White Faced Man… I-I think he’s a man; he’s the shape of a man. An-and I don’t know if his skin is very white or if it’s… something else, something like bleached leather… I j-j-just know the skin doesn’t belong to him… And he’s always staring at me, staring me down with deep black pits for eyes. Wherever I am in my dream, he will look at me with those eyes. His mouth is just stitches, like someone sewed him up… and-and-and when he… stares at me… he smiles… The stitches turn up in a smile like he knows something… And he’s there when I wake up and he smiles… he knows I can’t scream or move and-and-and he smiles!”

She rambled for some time, her hands wringing her skirt absently until the Doctor gently touched her wrist to bring her back to the room.

The doctor thought The White Faced Man was some warped version of Mary’s father.

“Of course he did,” Mary thought as she walked out of the office, “of course I’m just some fucked up Electra complex to him.” She was seething as she drove home. Her husband was waiting on her when her car pulled into their drive.

“How was the session?” Jon asked like he always did.

“Fine.” Mary said with an edge in her voice.

“Sounds like it was fine…” Jon countered sarcastically as he poured her a cup of tea. Mary broke down and told Jon everything about her session… About the White Faced Man, about the stupid doctor, and the stupid paralysis. Jon held her like he always did when she lost herself until her breathing slowed. It never took long; Mary always felt so safe in Jon’s arms. Anytime she could muster a murmur or gather the strength to move her hand during her sleep paralysis terrors, Jon’s arm would wrap back around her and the world would go back to normal.

Even The White Faced Man would disappear when Jon was holding her.



~



That night, before falling asleep, Jon gathered the strength to tell Mary his idea to alleviate her night terrors.
“Baby… I think you should try to take control of your dreams instead of letting them run you over every night.” His voice got progressively stronger as he detailed his idea to Mary’s inquisitive face. “Well, I’ve been reading about this thing called ‘lucid dreaming.’ You pretty much just accept you’re in a dream and then you can tell your brain to change whatever you want about it… You can turn the White Faced Man into a pony and then ride him like he’s your bitch!” They both laughed; Mary loved how Jon could make her laugh. 

He continued, more seriously, “But, really though… You’re the one with all the power here. If you can get the guts to take it…” He smiled and kissed her goodnight as they turned out their lights.



~



This one was bad, one of the worst she’d had. Mary was dreaming, she was in the Doctor’s office, sitting across from the White Faced Man like he was analyzing her. She couldn’t look away; their eyes were locked as the White Faced Man moved closer. She could see the detail on his “skin” now, cracked like leather as she thought, but there were veins bulging out, pumping blood through pale, corpse like flesh. He smelled like death, but was somehow breathing through the slits of his sewn mouth. The distance between them closed without movement and Mary could hear her dream-self whimpering in her paralysis.

But somehow willed herself to look into his eyes; she remembered what Jon said. Her dream and waking self were both aware of themselves Mary and was shocked to hear a steady, stutter free stream of words come out.
“You. Are. A. Dream.” She was no longer sitting the Doctor’s office, she was standing in her bedroom beside her sleeping self as the White Faced Man smiled through his stitch's, “You are a dream and you will not keep me from living my life!” She screamed with that power as she woke from her dream and felt Jon’s sleeping arm draped around her.  She breathed deeply and kissed Jon’s fingers as she drifted into a dreamless sleep.



~



Mary woke up the next morning feeling more refreshed than she ever thought she could feel in her life. Jon’s arm was still wrapped around her and as she stretched out on the bed, she felt it roll off of her. When she turned to kiss her husband, what she saw ensured she would never sleep again.

Jon’s arms had been ripped from his body, his mouth sewn shut with the same crude thread as the White Faced Man and the bed was steeped in his blood from the two words carved deep into his chest: “Sweet dreams.”",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_uftdm,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/uftdm/marys_dreams/,

It was never far behind; always lurking, always keeping watch.  As a child, I would find some comfort in wrapping my tiny grip around my mother's loving hands as we walked the streets.  After her untimely death, it seemed to delight in growing ever closer and torturing me with its knowing stare.  Even now, as I try to distract myself with my schoolings and job at the local market, my mind is constantly and agonizingly aware of the thing's watchful gaze.  


There are times I rid myself of the dreaded horror that curses me, though it is always a most difficult task.  Many years after my mother's funeral and being driven near to madness by the wretched darkness, I locked myself away in my rented room at Mrs. Davenport's boarding house.  Starving myself of all but a daily bowl of broth and claiming serious illness to any who came to check on my well-bring, I meditated on my circumstance in my windowless home.  Not a candle was lit for the entirety of my eight-day quarantine from the world, for I would surely see the thing lurking in any shadow cast on the walls.  However, on the ninth day, when I felt a clearness about my inner thoughts, I struck a match... and not a single creeping demon caught my eye.  That was the day I discovered a new-found bravery.  I was tired of living in endless fear and torment.  I had to fight back.


Knowing it would eventually come to haunt me again, and nearly paralyzed with dread, I forced myself to seek it out.  Walking the streets at night after the lamps were lit, I found their frightening forms easier to spot.  Shadows are their domain, and they mind about mostly after nightfall.


Eventually, I found one.  Its shapeless form was so familiar to me, so eerily vacant.  As I closed upon it, with nary a plan for Its demise, I found the thing and I were not so different.  We shared a common emotion: fear.  It morphed its appearance into that of an ordinary man and turned to me just as I tackled it to the cobblestone street.  Screaming at me in some distorted tongue, it attempted to subvert my intention by mimicking the look and behavior of an innocent human being... as if it could fool me.  I'd been running from the thing for over twenty years and it really believed I didn't know its awful smell.


It was beneath me, struggling; but what to do with it?  In a panicked frenzy, I grabbed a loose stone in the road, lifted it above my head, and brought it down with wild fury upon the monster's face.  I do not recall how many times I pounded the rock into the thing that night, but after I was satisfied, its face retained no human visage.  Yet, the body was still clothed like a man.  I could not leave it in the streets, for when morning would come, people would certainly think me a murderer.


Dragging the thing back to the boarding house without being spotted was certainly a chore.  Once I did so, however, I happened upon an abandoned well in the back yard which I recalled Mrs. Davenport warn me about when I first rented the room.  ""Poison water,"" she had mumbled, ""that old well's gone to shit.""  Indeed, the well already smelled rotten, so this foul demon's stench would undoubtedly go unnoticed.


I dumped it down the stone shaft and waited a few seconds for the sound of a splash.  The deed was done and I breathed a sigh of relief for the freedom I now enjoyed.  There wasn't a hideous thing in sight now.


Eventually, though, they did come back.  I'd have to repeat the process as years went by in order to buy myself another few months of sanity.  The things became more brazen as I heard word around the town that people were missing and a few even said they saw some evil thing dragging bodies in the darkness.  It must be desperate and angry, now that I've been killing the things so regularly.  It is now a war with the demons.  For every one of them I slay, they take an innocent life.


The bastards.  I must save these people from them.  Some day, they will know what I have been saving them from.  But for now, I continue the hunt...

""As long as there's a hammock, I'm happy; I've been driving all day,"" the driver of a dark blue truck said with an exhausted smile as they drove down a dark, overgrown dirt road.

""Don't worry Tom, there should be- I know how tiring it can be sitting all day,"" the passenger teased. A voice grumbled from the back seat,

""If it's anything like this road, it'll just break on you and leave you tangled to a tree.""

""Aw c'mon Dave, you know we don't get many chances to see each other, and this is free! Besides, it's dark out and we're almost there, so there's no turning back now,"" Lindsey pointed out.

""I know, and it is great to see you guys again, this place just creeps me out. It doesn't even look like anyone's been here in years,"" Dave stated, still slightly bitter that he had been out-voted on where to have their vacation.

""Oh don't worry, my uncle's been coming here for years, he'll have kept everything cleaned up. I haven't seen him in awhile, but I remember him always somehow being both artistic and a neat freak,"" she recalled.

 

Minutes later, the truck pulled up into the gravel driveway of a small, modest wooden cabin. While generally tidy, dirt and dead leaves had gathered on the steps from what looked like a couple months of no maintenance. Turning off and climbing out of the truck, Tom stretched out his limbs and let out a long yawn while Dave and Lindsey climbed out after him, bags on their backs.

""I'll go see if I can find the hammock, it'd be a shame to have to actually use a bed to lie down,"" Lindsey grinned mockingly. Climbing the steps, she noticed the screen door had been slashed. She cursed,

""Damn, my uncle must've left food here or something, looks like animals got in.""

Stepping into the porch sun-room, she noticed the front door was slightly ajar and she rolled her eyes, ""or some kids got in here again.""

Tom and Dave followed moments behind her as they all entered the cabin, which after the sun-room consisted only of a large sitting area with an attached kitchen, a bathroom, and a bedroom with two beds. In the far corner of the room stood an easel with painting supplies, and an unfinished sketch on it. A closer look revealed the sketch to be of what looked like a man, but with long, narrow limbs, far too long for his body. It looked like it had just been started, as the man was missing facial features, hands, and feet.

 

Unnerved by the strange drawing, Dave threw his bag next to the couch and turned to the door.

""I'll go grab the air mattress, unless one of you wants to share?"" Dave winked at Tom with a grin. They both laughed, and Dave stepped outside, closing the door behind him. Dropping themselves onto the couch, Tom and Lindsey began inspecting the numerous sketchbooks scattered on the table in front of them. Grabbing the one nearest to him, Tom flipped to a random page. The same image of the tall, long-limbed man was sketched numerous times on the page, each with the face and hands furiously scribbled out. Some looked to be shaded in with pencil, as if the man were bathed completely in shadow.

""Did your uncle draw these?"" Tom asked with a raised eyebrow.

""I dunno, he must have... these look like the sketchbooks he would always use before painting anything,"" Lindsey said while opening another random sketchbook. The page she opened to showed a nearly-complete sketch of the silhouette of the tall man. Most of his body was hidden in the shadows of the trees and bushes around him, but his upper torso and head were visible, hunched over and staring out at the viewer with unseen eyes from the darkness. Shuddering and closing the sketchbook, Lindsey grabbed her bag and stood up, ""I'm going to get my bed set up.""

""Yeah good idea, me too,"" Tom said, following behind her.

 

They both froze when they turned on the bedroom lights- there were paintings everywhere. Each wall was lined with as many of the paintings as they could fit, and some on the floor leaned against the wall where they didn't. Each one contained the same image of the man from the sketches, some of him hidden in shadow, not. Tom furrowed his brow as he took a close look at a nearby painting that showed the man's face. There were no eyes, ears, or a nose. The face was a deep black, with nothing more but a large, grotesque grin that revealed long, pointed teeth. Its hands were long with even longer fingers that reach down to its knees, ending in fine, sharp-looking points. In each painting, the creature seemed to be staring out at the viewer, hunched over and grinning unnaturally wide with those big, pointy teeth, almost as if it was looking down at you.

""Is uh... Is your uncle alright? Is there anything wrong with him or something?"" Tom asked, glancing around at all the faceless terrors, somehow feeling them stare back at him.

""Not that I know of, but this is... Wow."" Lindsey said, equally taken aback as she looked around. Suddenly, her stare froze, and her body tensed.

 

Following her gaze, Tom looked over to see the largest painting- From the floor to the ceiling, the creature stood in a dim lighting, as if from a distant outside light. Hunched over as all the others, it just barely managed to fit inside the frame. Deep black skin looked like it was pulled tight and stretched over a thin, bony frame. It was grinning the same grin, though this one seemed to have its teeth covered in blood, making it somehow even more unnerving to look at. Glancing down at the long, pointed hands hanging down by its sides, Tom noticed each long finger to be covered in blood, with more pooling around its feet as if it had just slashed and eaten some poor creature.

""God damn... Even if he is crazy, your uncle is one hell of a painter,"" Tom said, swallowing his nervousness. Lindsey responded in a nearly inaudible whisper, her eyes still yet to move.

""What?"" Tom tore his eyes away from the painting and leaned in closer to hear what she had said.

It wasn't mailed: a man knocked on my front door and left just a box.  I wrote it in a story form because describing the tapes wouldn't give you the image properly.  It's written from First Person POV strictly out of habit.**


**The tape starts with a stutter: “I don-n-n’t like the speech lady.”**

I remember reminding my mother as she practically dragged me along the sidewalk on the way to speech therapy every day.  It’s not that she was an abusive lady; as a matter of fact she may have been the best mother that she could be, given the child.  I was just a bit of a hassle, what with speech therapy.  

I thought *that* was a hassle.

I had an extremely strange speech impediment, which presented itself as a sort of stutter.  But it wasn’t omnipresent, as normal stutters are.  It wasn’t intermittent, and it didn’t show up unexpectedly.  It was only on one occasion. 

The letter ‘N.’ 

It had never made sense to me nor to my speech therapist.  She tried her best to just subtly hint me to saying words with N in them, but not so often as to discourage me.  She honestly tried her very best, but I had yet to improve.  When my father died and the income went with him, I was forced to resign my speech classes.  I never got better with the stutter - just better at hiding it. 

I took any words with the letter n out of my vocabulary.  Even as you read this, it’s only the words of what I’ve spoken on a series of cassette tapes, which I’ve leant to someone who is paraphrasing it to sound less awkward.  Needless to say, it hindered me some, but when you learn to speak at such a young age in such a way, you learn to do it without even thinking about it.  To a certain degree, I started just disregarding the letter n.  When I was forced to read in class, I’d just not pronounce the letter.  In younger grades, where the syllable count in words was low, this came easily.  But as my age increased, so did the prevalence of the letter.  

Once I’d reached middle school, my social life took quite a toll.  What my original speech impediment didn’t do, my new one had.  I was now void of companions as my disregard for the wretched letter made the tone of my speaking choppy and forced.  And because I was in 6th grade and because children don’t know better, I came across as ignorant.  Even some of the teachers thought my condition to be a form of retardation, until one thing changed that.  

I remember it very vividly: my very first research paper.  

I mention again that my family was living on a poverty-stricken budget, and so I’d spent hours handwriting a 2-page paper, with which I intended to gain the favor of my English teacher.  Like I’d said, I’d learned to basically stop thinking with any words that used the letter, and so even when I wrote, the letter never appeared.  Which is why I feel the need to tell you the topic of the paper. 
 
The Nuremberg trials.  

I’d mentioned the title of these trials only once in my paper, still managing to wow my teacher and even prompting her to present it to the class (anonymously, of course).  With my success at wooing my teacher came the emaciation of my hopes of keeping quiet.  Near the end of the year, my English teacher had insisted I hone my gift of writing into a career.  But at that point, all I wanted was to be left alone. 

As all of the other children began to flirt and date and find things they were good at, I remained alone and clueless.  And the only gift I seemed to show was the very impediment I’d avoided throughout my adolescence.  This had driven me into a wave of depression that eventually escalated to the clinical definition.  I knew my mother couldn’t afford therapy, so I didn’t even bring it up. 
 
My English teacher was so ecstatic about my potential as a writer that she offered me a writing workshop afterschool.  I’d quickly turned down the offer.  I wasn’t going to give up an hour of time I could be home… sitting and doing nothing, come to think of it.  But one day, the trap was set just right and I got caught.  My mother had a job interview that started just as school would get out, and I’d been suspended from the bus due to (being accused of) throwing a water bottle at another passenger.  And so I wouldn’t have a ride home until, conveniently, an hour after school.  

I won’t give you the details as I can already tell that this is a bit lengthy, but the important thing was that she’d brought back out my first research paper, asking me to analyze it and see what could be made better.  As I read through it, I got to the occurrence of the letter.  But instead of my remedial handwriting, I saw a perfectly cursive N.  I pointed it out to the teacher, and she said that she’d written it in.  “There was just no N there.  I figured you’d just run through it without noticing you’d skipped it.”  

I never figured out how my mother had done it, but she’d somehow managed to accumulate enough money to buy me what every sixth grader wanted (though most already had one at my school, and never let me forget it).  She’d gotten me my very own laptop.  It wasn’t extravagant, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was used, but I didn’t mind much.  It gave me even the slightest hint of normalcy.  And that was all I could hope for.  

But, as the gifts in my life always do, it came with a fresh coat of Hell glazed over top of it.  But this Hell wasn’t about my anger at the letter or even at myself.  This Hell is the reason I’m even telling you this story.  

It was the Hell of the unexplainable.  

As I got the computer, I’d realized that you need more than a computer to actually get on the internet.  But I didn’t want to depreciate the value of the gift by complaining about it to my mother, so I’d used what little money I had to buy a wireless router for the internet and hook it up without my mom’s knowing.  

As I’d started surfing the internet, I found a site called “fanfiction.net,” which I began using to anonymously post variations of stories to hone my writing ability.  I was introduced to it by a google search.  The first time I’d gone to the website wasn’t important; I’d just clicked on a link.  
The second time was when things had gotten strange.  

I typed the website into the search bar, looking down at the keys as I was still in the hunt-and-peck phase of typing.  I pressed enter and looked up, immediately seeing an error.  I looked back up at the address bar and found that instead of fanfiction.net, it typed, “fafictio.et.”  With refusal to click the easily accessible link to my desired site, I tried again.  The same thing had occurred, and so I tried once more, putting extra effort onto the N key.  Still nothing.  In volatile frustration, I ripped the key off of the machine and chucked it across the room.  I then felt utter guilt for ruining my mother’s gift.  I never let her see the carnage. 

**Author’s Note: The next tape I'd put in was undoubtedly long after the other tapes, as I could hear that the recorder's voice had gotten much deeper.  The next part of this story is a mixture of facts and interpretation.  There is a tape which describes these events, but it is not extremely specific.  But any events can be supported by the dialogue on the tape, and any noise from the background**

That summer, my mother became extremely ill and I voted to leave my home to live in the hospital with her.  This sent me into a wave of depression far worse than what I’d experienced in prior years.  It truly snapped me, and I began a wave of self-harm and eventually began hearing voices.  They kept me company, berating me just as I began to berate myself.  There was one thing they really loved to rub in my face. 

They could say the letter N.  And you don’t understand how painful it is to hear someone flaunt such a simple skill until you’re in my shoes.  

One night, the voices had pushed me one step too far, and I fell over the edge.  I cut deeper than I’d ever cut before, and in a much more obvious place than I’d ever done before.  I’d made two deep trenches perpendicular to my arm, low on my wrist.  Between the two, I made a diagonal gash, perhaps deeper than the other two.  As the blood began gushing out more than I was accustomed to, I knew that I’d gotten just what I wanted.  But I’d changed my mind.  

I realized that the gashes were ironically synonymous with the letter N.  

I ran over to the table beside my mother, sound asleep as her son was bleeding out beside her.  I found the needle for the IV she’d no longer needed.  I used the same blade I’d cut with to disconnect the needle from the source of liquid.  I found some of the material they use to stitch people up with and haphazardly sewed my skin closed without any preparation.  It wasn’t pretty, but by the time I’d gotten to the parallel gash I’d begun somewhat of a pattern and the bleeding actually slowed, giving me a glimmer of hope.  Eventually I’d stitched it up as best I could, and I knew that for the rest of my life I’d have a permanent N on my arm mocking me.  Just as I used the blade I’d found to cut the thread and end the stitching, I felt a rush of liquid down my arm.  I looked down to find the blood gushing out faster than before.  Just like my research paper and my computer, the N that I'd made on my arm had disappeared.

But in this case, it was the stitches. 

I felt the toll of all the lost blood flowing down to the floor.  I could only muster a small whisper after I collapsed to the floor, the cassette tape I'd turned on twenty minutes ago slamming to the floor right by my face: 

**The tape ends with a stutter: ""I n-n-need a n-n-nurse.""**

But they see us. They watch us. And if you get too close, they can feed.

Ghosts. They are real, but they aren't spirits of the dead. They are living things like us. Sentient beings that breed, breathe, live, die and feed. They aren't physical beings, though. They can't actually hurt you, unless you allow them to. They feed on emotions. Anger, sorrow and most of all, fear. These feelings make us weak to their influence and for this reason they are attracted to those of us who are depressed or afraid. It's convenient for them that we feel a natural fear in their presence. In the dark.

What happens when they feed? The feeling becomes stronger. Most people who are depressed have a horde of these ghosts following them. Their depression will become worse and worse until they can't take it anymore. Suicide. There has been an increase in the suicide rates of the whole world. More and more people are depressed, more and more people are angry. Violence makes them stronger, and more violence follows. It's a path with one outcome. Our downfall. And the rate of violence and depression is climbing with and increasing pace. They are breeding.

When police arrived at the home of Debbie Mason to arrest the man she had found in the cabinet under her bathroom sink, the circumstances were vague at best. The man, who was relatively well dressed in that he was wearing an almost pristine waistcoat over his ragged ensemble of jeans and tee shirt, was unidentified at the time, refused to answer any of their questions, and for all intents and purposes was unnerving every officer on the scene. He was tall, at roughly six feet four inches, lightly muscled, wore horn rimmed glasses but no shoes, and had a shock of greasy black hair that extended entirely over his face which lent him the uncanny appearance of some sort of mismatched shambling creature from a horror story, although he would later prove to be an entirely natural being, one living breathing Thomas Bantham. Bantham spoke perfect English, without a trace of any identifiable accent and, once taken to the station and ensured that he would be provided wih a lawyer, was more than willing to speak in his defense. 

Thomas claimed that while he was indeed in the Mason home against the will of its owner, his actions were purely those of a hobbyist, and not of a violent man or a pervert. While he seemed blissfully unaware that his trespassing constituted criminal action regardless of the motive, he went on to excitedly boast that he had spent the entire past month living in his cabinet beneath the sink practicing what he called ""Bumping in the Night"". While he was unwilling to provide details on the whereabouts of others, he told the police of his own volition that he wasn't the only practitioner of this strange hobby, and that he was a common face himself at statewide meetings of people just like him. The aim of the activity, according to Bantham, was to spend as much time as possible living in the home of a complete stranger, and to keep them unaware of your presence as you did so. 

A common theme among Bumping ventures, according to Bantham, was attempting to increase the difficulty of the stay, by making noise during the night from locations in the house, taking risky walks in plain sight while the owner was either asleep or awake on the premises, or even by leaving clues as to the presence of the unseen visitor. 


While the conviction of Thomas Bantham was quick and simple, the judge was only able to give him a sentence of three years, as they were unable to prove in the court that he had entered the Mason home with force. He was a free man after serving his sentence, and there's no reason to say that he'd be unable to continue to practice his odd hobby to this very day. 

No future cases involving Bumping were ever brought to the attention of any court system again. Police are still unable to determine if Thomas was lying, or if the criminals in question are just rarely caught.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_tjhin,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/tjhin/in_the_night/,

Well, that fit Bobby Hansen to a ‘T’. He was the best poker player in the county, but somehow he couldn’t find himself a bride. Oh, he proposed to several girls, and even got accepted by a few. But they always got cold feet a day or two before the wedding, and it was bye-bye Bobby.

After the third time, Bobby was mighty discouraged, and his Pa felt real sore for him. They worked together in the family grocery store, and Bobby would sometimes sit on top of the pickle barrel and tell his Pa all his woes. And his Pa told him to hang in there, because a nice lady was on her way. Neither of them believed it, but it made both of them feel better to hear it said. Well, the day after their latest talk, the old woman who poled her barge through the swamp to deliver milk and eggs to the grocery store had a long talk with Bobby’s Pa. Seems she had this daughter who was hankering after a husband with a good steady job, and the old woman thought Bobby would do the job nicely. She suggested they introduce the pair at the next dance, and Bobby’s Pa agreed.

The night of the dance, Bobby’s Pa insisted that his son dress in his best. Bobby was dragging his feet a little, remembering all those women who played him false and not wanting to go, but his Pa dragged him out anyway. Well, the moment Bobby clapped eyes on the dark-eyed, red-lipped girl from the swamp, he was head over heels in love. Her eyes sparkled like the sunlight on the bay. Her skin was as creamy as new milk. Her voice was low and sweet.

The pair cuddled and cooed and waltzed the whole night long, and come sunrise Bobby was all for bringing his new love before the visiting priest who delivered his sermons in the grocery store (since there weren’t no church in that vicinity) and getting married right away. Well the girl was willing to get married, but not by a priest.

“Let’s just go to Beaumont and have the judge marry us,” she said to Bobby, and he was so smitten he agreed, though it would have been quicker and easier to just walk a mile down the road to see the priest.

By the next evening they were wed, and Bobby brought his pretty bride to the nice little cottage he rented just down the road from the family grocery. It had a nice front porch with a swing, a big bedroom on the second floor and a big attic with a window that could be made up into a second guestroom should his new mother-in-law care to visit from her home in the swamp.

After fixing him a nice dinner, Bobby’s new bride sat awhile in the rocking chair near their bed while Bobby yawned and watched her fondly. She cuddled under the blanket and knitted and hummed, and Bobby’s eyes grew heavy. He didn’t wake up until early morning, when his new bride crept into bed all hot and sweaty and fell asleep at once. When he asked her where she’d been, she wouldn’t answer him. Bobby was mighty sore that his bride had snuck out on him on their wedding night, but when she got snappish and her eyes blazed like they did when he questioned her, he grew frightened and backed down.

Life took on an odd pattern for Bobby. During the day, everything was perfect. His wife was sweet and pretty and loving. She kept the house sparkling clean and cooked him wonderful meals. But each night she refused to come to bed after supper. Like their wedding night, she sat up singing and rocking and knitting until he was asleep and did not come to bed til just afore dawn. She was always sweaty and cranky when she came to bed, and went to sleep before Bobby could question her.

Bobby was very confused and upset by this behavior, and finally confided in his Pa one morning after opening up the grocery store. Bobby’s Pa was awful worried. The visiting priest had gone on to his next parish, and there was no one they could consult but the local conjure woman. So he sent Bobby to her with a couple of chickens as a gift.

The conjure woman knew all about hoodoo magic and was an excellent herbalist. Local folks went to her when they were sick, on account of the doctor lived nigh on twenty miles away. When she heard Bobby’s story, she told him to pretend to go to sleep that night and watch what his new bride did. Then he was to come back and tell her everything. Bobby agreed.

The next evening, he pretended to fall asleep while his bride rocked and sang in her chair. Then he followed her up to the attic and watched through the crack in the open door as she sat down at the spinning wheel and spun off her skin, leaving only pulsing red muscles and blue veins. She was a terrifying sight and she sprang through the window and flew away into the night. Bobby ran out to the privy and was sick after he saw her. Who, what was this monster he had married? He was still trembling and in shock when his bride, looking like a normal person again, crept into bed at dawn, and he had trouble behaving normally at breakfast.

As soon as he could get away, Bobby ran to the home of the conjure woman and told her about the spinning wheel and the terrible skinless creature who flew away from his attic. “A boo-hag,” the conjure woman said at once. “You’ve married a boo-hag.”

“What’s a boo-hag?” asked Bobby. “A Boo Hag is a witch and a shape-shifter,” said the conjure woman. “She lures men into her trap and then delivers them to her Boo-Daddy, who eats their flesh and gnaws their bones. And that’s what she’ll do to you if you don’t get rid of her first.”

The conjure woman told Bobby to get himself some blue paint. As soon as the boo-hag left the house that night, he was to spread blue paint on every window frame and every door frame and make sure it was two coats thick. A boo-hag couldn’t fly through a window or door that was painted blue. And if she didn’t get back into her skin before dawn, she would be trapped without it, and be revealed for the monster she was. So he was to leave one tiny window unpainted, and keep it open a sliver so the boo-hag could squeeze through. Then he was to fill up her skin with salt and pepper, which would burn her up from the inside out. And Bobby promised to do exactly as the conjure woman said.

That night, Bobby lingered over his dinner, looking with sad eyes at the pretty woman sitting opposite him. He knew she was really a monster inside, but it was so nice to have a little wife in his home. He hated like anything to see her go. But he didn’t want to get eaten by a Boo-Daddy, and that was his fate if she stayed. So he went up to their bedroom and pretended to fall asleep while she rocked and sang and knitted. Then he followed her quietly upstairs and put salt and pepper into her skin after her ugly red-muscled blue-veined figure had flown out the window to her Boo-Daddy. He spent the rest of the night painting over every door and window frame with blue paint, leaving only one small unpainted window open in the cellar. He nailed it up so that it would open no further than a crack, just as the conjure woman instructed him. Then he hid himself behind a large chest of drawers up in the attic to wait for the boo-hag.

Just before dawn, the boo-hag came flying up to the attic window. As soon as she touched the blue frame, she gave a shriek of pain and rage. Bobby listened as she flew around the house, testing each window and door and howling like a banshee when it burned her skinless hands. Then she found the little window in the cellar, and he heard the thump as she landed beside it, followed by a painful whimpering sound as she squeezed and squeezed herself through the narrow opening, her skinless red muscles and blue veins tearing painfully against the rough wood.

The boo-hag ran up three flights of stairs into the attic and squeezed and squeezed into her skin as fast as she could. She just barely got it on when the first light of dawn shone over the horizon. And that was when the salt and pepper did their work, burning the boo-hags body from the inside out. With a scream of agony, she flung herself out the attic window. The glass shattered everywhere as she tried to fly away, tearing at the skin to get it off. But it was too late. She exploded into tiny pieces right over the swamp, and the alligators had them a mighty feast of cooked boo-hag for breakfast that morning.

So Bobby was once again without a wife. But bachelorhood looked much better to him after that, and he never went looking for a wife again. ‘Course, after he made a pile of money in oil, the girls started chasing him. But that’s another story!

                        The Fyr
          It all started a few weeks ago. I woke up unusually early for me and followed my plans of walking to my school. When I arrived I was thirty minutes to early and decided to kill some time on the schools private track, near a swamp in the woods. The morning was grey and eerily quiet, already putting me on edge. When I approached the track I heard loud noises ""PING!"". It sounded like a rock hitting a hollow pole. I was the only one nearby  so I brushed it off, oh I wish I just took the bus that morning. As I got closer the woods were silent, no birds singing a happy song, no squirrels bounding across leaves, no geese honking overhead, all silent, all except the damn pinging noise, oh that bone-chilling sound. I don't know if the freezing weather amplified the fear, but I did not want to stay there alone, oh how alone I felt, but I was not alone, oh no i was not. As I carried on, knowing I was safe, the only thing within a thousand feet, I continued down the twisting dark path through the woods, to the track. ""PING!"" Again, the unnatural, eerie noise. This set me off, the young athlete I am, I set off down the path, only  until i reached about one hundred feet from the track I slowed down. As I neared the track I felt boiling hot, in the unnaturally cold air, it was unexplainable, but I took my coat, my sweatshirt, and my two shirts off, leaving only a plain white t-shirt with a ragged pair of jeans exposed. As I began running picking up speed I heard it again, ""PING!"". It seemed the quicker I ran the louder and more frequent it got. I finished my first lap and I realized the gate that opens up to the trail was shut, and I had not shut it as it required a key. Finding this more than a little odd I approached the gate, knowing a fifteen pound gate dug straight into the dirt could not shut itself, much less get pushed closed by the non-existent wind that day. As I approached the steel gate I saw something glistening on the ground. It was a padlock, not a small little master lock, a 3 pound solid steel goddamned piece of fine security, split right down the middle, as if it were bread cut with a samurai sword. This convinced me that something wasn't right so I was about to vault right over the gate and make it back to civilization so I started running towards the gate. ""PING PING PING PING!"" I was frozen in fear, but curiosity got the best of me. I turned around, and there, standing in front of me was the most disfigured creature I had ever laid my eyes on. As soon as I attempted to scream the pale monster only grinned and was gone. Not like ""poof"" and he just disappears, no, before I could study him the ""thing"" leapt away at speeds Lightning couldn't  achieve, and began to almost vanish into mist disappearing in seconds. Now at the time I couldn't understand it, and was scared stiff, but I knew that was not the last of that horrifying creature, I was right. Three weeks later I was getting ready for bed and was putting on a pair of shorts. ""PING"" again, and I knew it wasn't just a hallucination. Whatever this monster was it wasn't going away. As I slowly crept into bed I heard a scratching at my window. Terrified, I slowly turn my head turns the window, clutching my fathers Bowie knife I had snuck under my pillow for the past three months. When I turned my head to the window I sighed a breath of relief. It  was only a tree tapping my window. I turn around and realize I had
 let my guard down. There, was a 7 foot tall ""animal"" that was hunched over, with arms almost touching the floor, clutching a butchers cleaver in one hand, splashed and dripping with blood, and a child's doll in the other, also splashed with blood. It's appearance was pale and fleshy like a week old corpse, with luminescent crimson eyes, and no pupils. it had a jagged posture and spines were extruding from every place on its body. It's face was mangled, with a cruel, crooked smile stretching across it. It had a necklace, strung with a black hair braid and fingernails, and children's teeth all hanging around its long neck.  I screamed as loud as I could, charging at the beast at the same time. Every time I approached it darted aside, and every time I screamed, or I stabbed, or he dodged, it's smile would grow more and more horrific, and his lips seemed to spread to his cheek bone, but the worst part was how much it seemed to enjoy this. I heard my parents rush up the staircase and I felt a wave of relief, and when they opened the door,  the monster was gone. I wonder today how lucky I was on that day, and after discussing with my parents, they think I was hallucinating, but if i need to tell anybody we've called it the fyr. that is until yesterday. I had one last encounter with the beast, and this was the most recent, and terrifying one, yet. After I finished brushing my teeth I laid down on my mattress, which was moved into my parents bedroom. My parents were out on a date and had left me alone. As i was drifting to sleep I heard a peculiar, but oh so familiar noise. ""PING"", assuming I was dreaming, I turned over and continued resting. As I was about to fall asleep I heard the squeal of my front door open. Now I was aware of what was happening. I jumped up from the bed and reached for my fathers nightstand. I opened the drawers and pulled out a 9mil personal defense handgun my father carried around. I shoved my hand, rustling through the drawers finding one cold brass shell. I ejected the magazine and thrust the bullet in. I heard footsteps coming up the steps and I clumsily mashed the magazine into the 9mil colt pistol, hearing the reassuring click of the slide being released. I aimed the weapon at the door and I heard a sharp noise behind me.  ""PING"", the noise was deafening and I was clutching my ears, loosening my grip on the pistol. ""Squeeeeeeal"" the door opens. I prepare myself as the monster enters the room, smiling wider than ever. I hold the gun for what seems forever, finally pulling the trigger. I watch as that horrible beast extends its arm with the doll, snatching the bullet out of the air effortlessly. The beast snarled, and vanished into the horrible mist. It reeked of decomposing waste, and I was greeted with a wave of relief as my parents car pulled in the driveway. That was yesterday and today is today, and I feel safe once again. Now I have to go, it sounds as if my dog wants to come in.

Though the government of the surrounding area had caught wind of Milne Biological's projects four years ago, during the very earliest stages of genetic manipulation, they have yet to be informed on just how far those procedures had gone, how successful they really were, and Milne has had every intention of keeping it that way. To this end, the search and subsequent deforrestation has been especially productive, as the chief executives at Milne had adopted a very stringent work schedule. It's extremely doubtful the operation would have had such immense and swift success had it not been for the detention of ex-employee and subject sympathizer C. Robin, who, after chemical therapy and forceful persuasion, was more than happy to divulge the location of each and every subject. The staff on the operation found it noteworthy that at the mere mention of his name, many subjects gave themselves up willingly, without a bother. After six discrete, highly productive weeks of reclamation,  only one subject remains to be neutralized and brought in for autopsy. 
 

Dr. Winchell made his way down the fortified detention hall, tray in hand, ready for the procedure. Winchell stopped at the end of the hall and keyed himself into the steel door on the left, which dislodged slowly and swung outward. From the threshold, Winchell could see the patient, who had necessitated heavy restraints, due to an unforseen disposition for jarring and rapid movement. Winchell stepped inside.
 

""Hiya, doctor! How're you this wondiferus day?""
 
 
""Fine, thank you. I hope I'm not intruding.""
 
 
""Don't be ridickerous! It's always nice to have a pal. Say, whatcha got there?""
 
 
""Well, I thought we'd have a little tea party today. Does that sound nice?""
 
 
""Abso-loot-ly, doc! But where's your cup?""
 
 
""Well, the other doctors and I have already had our tea. But I didn't want to leave you out."" 


""Aw, ain't you just the sweetest. Well give it here!""
 

Winchell handed the subject the bontoxilysin-laced delivery agent in a small china cup. The subject sniffed the cup with delight and took a sip.
  

  ""You know the wonderful thing about Tiggers, doncha?""
  

  ""What's that?""
  

  ""It's that I'm the only one!!""
 

The subject consumed the balance of the delivery agent and belched happily, smacking his lips. Winchell marked the time on a clipboard on the tray and then smiled before turning to key himself out.

	The medical examiner pulled back her raven black hair into a professional ponytail and put on a pair of baby blue sterile gloves. She gave the body a once-over.  
	Multiple lacerations to the head and neck. None fatal. Several severe contusions covering the chest and abdomen, along with three cracked ribs.  
	The victim had suffered two GSWs; one to the right hand, through and through, and another to the upper left arm. The bullet had entered the flesh at a little less than forty-five degrees, ripping through tissue and muscle until it hit bone. It traveled along the humerus and kept going until it was embedded in the jaw. Along the way, the projectile had burst through the carotid artery, severing it and killing the boy.  
	His name was Bobby Swinton.  
	The medical examiner flashed an unconscious smile. The name reminded her of a singer from the fifties that her father used to listen to on the old record player he kept in his study.  
	She used to put on a blue dress like the one in the song and dance around on her tip toes like some sort of ballerina.   
	But that was a long time ago.  
	She turned her eyes back to the slab. The boy looked peaceful, like he had only just laid down for a nap. She glanced down at his now-exposed privates and noticed a slight erection. She marked on the examination form. Posthumous arousal was known as Angel Lust in the Morgue crowd and it was a relatively common occurrence.   
	Still, something didn’t seem quite right.   
	Regardless, it was time for her to make an incision.   
	On the air, there was the faint scent of cherries. Or maybe grenadine. The strange, syrupy smell sent her mind into another fading memory.  
	The week before, the medical examiner had decided that she was tired of spending her Saturday nights at home, alone with a pile of case files and too many cups of black coffee.   
So she went through her closet and threw on a dusty little black dress and headed out to a chic little club downtown that she may have been a little too old for.  
	She had ordered a tequila sunrise- a drink she was surprised to find that she had outgrown- and wound up bringing a cute little sorority girl home.   
	Long story short, they fucked and she never called the girl back. It was precisely what the doctor ordered.
	With another twist of a smile, the medical examiner turned back to the corpse.  She selected a scalpel off the cart and she began her routine.  
	Before dissecting a body for autopsy, the medical examiner would take a deep breath, hold it and try to imagine something pleasant. Something to counteract the image of wading through a stranger’s intestines with your fingers.   
	The medical examiner usually thought of something simple like chocolate or a summer drive on a summer night, but now all she could think of was that sorority girl.  
	She sighed and got to work.  
	To open up a cadaver, one must make one incision near the top of one shoulder to the base of the sternum, then you make another incision on the opposite shoulder, cutting all the way to the naval, creating a Y-shape. From there, you open the body as easy as opening an envelope or pulling petals from a stem.  
	The medical examiner was more than familiar with this practice, but she was still somewhat amazed at how simple it was to get to a person’s insides.  
	She positioned the scalpel over the body and the reflection of the fluorescent lights flashed angrily into her eyes. Half blinded, she had the strange sense of a shadow passing over the body in front of her.   
	She set the scalpel back on the cart and squeezed the bridge of her nose in order to rid her eyes of the purplish spots that waded through her vision like tadpoles.  
	She sighed. Second time’s the charm, she thought.  
	Steeling herself, she pierced the chest cavity just above the nipple and pulled the blade down to the naval. There was a slight tearing sound, like ripping damp paper.   
	The body’s eyes and mouth snapped open like twin rat traps in reverse.  
	The scent of cherries suddenly magnified until it was almost unbearable and some sort of dark pink slime like rancid Pepto-Bismol began to gush from the newly formed wound.  
	The medical examiner sprang back, dropping the scalpel onto the linoleum with a tinny clatter.  
	The pink goo began to bubble out of the gash like boiling water left unattended. It seeped out of the wound onto the slab and began to steam. It appeared to be eating away at the stainless steel.  
	The body sat up at the waist. The gunk began to cut through the flesh and the scent of cherries mixed with burning flesh. Then with a sickening squelch, the spinal cord snapped in two like so much licorice and the torso stood free from the bottom half of the corpse.  
	The head slowly turned and locked eyes with the medical examiner. There were no pupils, no irises. Only a pair of lifeless wine-red orbs. The medical examiner’s knees locked in fear as though they had rusted over.   
	A terrible scratching sound rose from deep within the body’s throat.  
	Pain like a hot wire seared through her palms.   
	The jolt of pain momentarily cleared the haze in the medical examiner’s brain and she began to back away towards the door without taking her eyes off the spectacle in front of her.    
	The scratching sound continued, but it began to sound like some sort of speech.  
	A memory too slippery to grasp crashed through the medical examiner's mind and she suddenly knew.   
	The body was speaking Latin.  
	The examiner let out an unconscious scream as she backed into the double doors of the morgue. Somehow, her arms lacked the strength to push them open.  
	She was unexplainably powerless.  
	She watched as the body began to pull itself across the examining table, the pink substance dripping onto the floor, hissing with each drop.  
	The medical examiner noticed that the incision she had made mere moments before was beginning to split horizontally. What was once a clean, straight cut was now a grotesque, cross-shaped gash.  
	When the body reached the end of the table, it hesitated briefly before dropping to the floor with an explosive, wet sound.   
Then there was silence.  
The medical examiner swallowed and immediately regretted it.  
The bloody heap began to stir.   
The thing’s neck bones creaked as it looked up at her, mouth agape.  
The body dragged itself across towards the medical examiner, leaving a crimson slug-trail in its wake.  
	The woman held her arms out in front of her, willing the creature to stop.   
	There were two fresh wounds drilled through the palms of her hands.  
	The crawling thing only made a steadier advance.  
	In the end, the girl began to laugh, a high pitched squeal like hogs in the slaughterhouse.  
	The spectre reached out its disembodied hands and tenderly stroked her hair.  
	It placed its bloodless lips on hers.  
	There was a terrible sucking sound and the medical examiner could feel the blood draining from her veins.  



	At the end of the workday, just before locking up, the custodian noticed a light down in the chilly basement. He walked slowly down the stairs so as not to disturb anyone who may have been working. He was surprised to find that the light was pouring out from the examination room. The technicians were usually the first to leave at closing time, and he couldn’t see anyone at work inside the enclosed room. He pushed open the double doors and the limp body of the medical examiner fell heavy across his feet.   
Apart from that, he was alone in an empty morgue.

1342584660.0,34,self.creepypasta,wqqgc,Police summary report of the New Orleans Police District 2 - April 11th 1834,creepymonkeiboi,39,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/wqqgc/police_summary_report_of_the_new_orleans_police/,"This report is a summary of a true and honest account as affirmed by this constable, Nathaniel McKellar, affirmed on the eleventh of April, year Eighteen and Thirty Four.

We were first made aware of an incident from a slave entering the station at just before dusk on the tenth. He was a boy, aged 16, named Thompson. The boy reported a kitchen fire at the Lalaurie estate in the french quarter. Myself, Constable Youngman, Detective LaSalle, and three fellows from the fire station next door proceeded to the residence with haste. A one Dr. Nemont was nearby the house when we arrived and agreed to assist with medical aid for injured. The fire deputies entered the the side entrance to the residence and found a small fire that was mostly self-extinguished in a trash bin next to the stove. They were able to contain the immolation without undue difficulty. The madam of the home, Lalaurie advised that the fire was purposely set by the boy Thompson and requested that he be removed from the house by arrest. Upon questioning, the boy admitted to the arson to Detective LaSalle and claimed that several persons were trapped in the roof storage closet. Madam Lalaurie denied these accusations and refused our request to proceed upstairs. LaSalle took note of the boys sincerity and proceeded to the fourth floor. We made for the roof and located a one room extension built onto the roof with the dimensions of a small stable. The walls were double layered brick and exceedingly sturdy. One of the fire deputies made entrance into the locked outer door by way of a truncheon bar. 

The inside of the room was unnaturally cool as a product of a later discovered ice box, and dark, lit only by a single lantern at the rear of the room. Upon entrance Constable Youngman and the three fire deputies were overtaken by the smell and fled from the rooftop. Myself, Detective LaSalle, and Doctor Nemont remained. At the entrance there was a large flat wooden table with straps to the left. THe table was slotted and coated with blood. Remaining strapped to the table by one arm was a human torso of a negro slave. The head, one arm, the legs, and the genetalia were removed. On the right of the room was a vertical stretching table with a female of indeterminate race attached by several metal spikes. The female was nude, although her genetalia were similiar mutilated. Her feet were removed at the ankles. Her lower jaw had similiarly been removed exposing her tongue. According to the doctor, the wounds had been cauterized to prevent blood loss in a crude fashion and she was being kept alive via tubes running into her body from a suspended sheep's bladder containing blood. Further in LaSalle identified four cages containing four seperate negro prisoners. The four were in various states of physical mutilation, missing limbs, eyes, and many scarred wounds on their bodies. All four were in a state of mental insanity, and were of no value as to what had happened. Across from their cages was a large ice box with vent tubes that kept the room at a chilly temperature at all times. The box was rigged with a dumbwaiter pulley that allowed a fresh block of ice to be lifted from below without anyone needing to enter the room. Inside the box was a storage shelf containing several bladders filled with blood labeled with names of the victims. The doctor, bless Lord for his presence of mind, had been a veteran of the war and was a stalwart figure for myself. He figured that the blood was drawn from the victims first, kept cool, and rentered into their bodies to prevent them from perishing from blood loss. Also above this box was a shelf that hung various instruments of a medical or vicious nature. Most of the blades, shears, and hammers were stained with blood. 

At the rear of the room, A last body was suspended on a rack, as we approached we could hear the woman whimpering in pain. The ropes were drawn extremely taut and her arms appeared to be dislocated. At Detective LaSalle's attempt to remove her bonds, he tripped a mechanism built into the floor that released a suspended bladed instrument from the ceiling, which swung downwards at an angle and cleanly seperated the woman to two at the chest. LaSalle was caught in the path of the instrument, and suffered an instantly fatal wound to his neck. The prisoner thrashed wildly in silence, furthering her injuries by tearing a dislocated arm from her body, and then promptly expired. 

Next to this rack on the back wall was a small thresher type device, that emptied into a large oil trap. The contents of which were around half full with festering meat and bone. I observed several human teeth in the mass.

I then exited the room and descended to the first floor to order the arrest of Madam LaLaurie, but was informed she had departed by carriage as we were moving upstairs, in the direction of the docks. We were informed by several dockands that a well dressed lady had paid considerable coin to board a departing merchantman headed for Jamaica.  

A warrant for her detainment was ordered by Chief Constable Hayes, though her return seems unlikely. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_wqqgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/wqqgc/police_summary_report_of_the_new_orleans_police/,

I don’t remember how I got here, but that’s not important right now. It’s too perfect here for anything to be important. But as I sit something starts to disturb me.  The hair on my neck stands up. Sea air isn’t supposed to smell of decaying flesh. The water isn’t supposed to be a sickly black. There shouldn’t be this much fog and I shouldn’t be hearing all these voices. This place shouldn’t exist, I shouldn’t be here. This is not my realm, not my world. It’s theirs.

“Emily May Collins,” they whisper “you have failed your test.” 

My hands begin to shake uncontrollably. I remember no test.  I look for the source of the voices, but there is none. They are everywhere, nowhere.  I stand up, and try to run from the voices, feeling the sand slip and move under me, I can’t run very fast at all, and it’s torture. Panic starts to set in as I feel them get closer, and something icy cold grabs my ankle. A force unnaturally strong rips me off my feet and my face stings as it hits the sand. It starts to laugh as it drags me.
	
 I start to claw at the loose ground, with no avail. The earth just comes with me, with no problem. Screaming and kicking, I fight for my life, but it’s no use. This…creature has a completely solid hold on me, and doesn’t so much as flinch when I struggle with all my might.  As a final attempt, I look up at it to beg for my life, and finally see what has a hold of me. Its hand, with long black fingers grasps my ankle without mercy, connecting up to its skinny, rigid frame and its face, oh God that face...It had this long, sunken in jaw and huge dark eye sockets, empty of eyes. Its mouth was a sick twisted red spiral with fanged teeth jagging out of it, a smug expression on its face. I knew then that whatever this was, it knew no human emotions and would not respond to bargains or begging. 

Accepting defeat, I begin to sob into the ground.  Slowly though, sand would catch in my mouth and pile into my throat, making me cough and suck up more sand.  Soon I was rasping and clutching my throat, unable to bear the pain of the sand soaking up any moisture my throat could’ve had. It burns, oh God it burns it burns it burns. I scream and scream and cough and retch, but nothing comes up besides sand.


Then suddenly I’m in a hospital room, except not quite there, or here, or anywhere. A humble observer to this world, it seems. I see myself in a hospital bed, gauze covering most of my body, with 2 people hovering over me that I know love me, but I can’t quite recall their names or role in my life. A man in a white coat strolls in and says, “I’m sorry Mr. and Mrs. Collins, but the infection has spread to her throat, and the treatment has deemed unsuccessful. She has failed her test.”

It was a week after graduation. Highschool graduation.  We were bored.  We wanted some excitement.  There was a wooded area near our houses.  About six miles away from the enterance to the woods was an old dilapidated building.  This big compound.  Kids from our area would go there to drink and smoke and shit.  So everyone knew about it.  We wanted trouble.  To do things kids shouldn’t do.  Why us.  They wont tell me that.  They never tell me that.
 
We headed into the woods with a little weed for when we got to the compound.  All four of us.  It was a long walk to the compound.  God, I was
They punish me for using that word.  Im sorry.  Im sorry im sorry im sorry.
 
We walked the six miles.  We talked about school getting out.  Me and Harold were going to the same college, Mike was going to a state college and Tim was joining the military.  It was a good plan.  We knew wed all still see eachother.  Wed still be together. Always together.  I wish I was with them now.
We got to the compound around midnight or so.  It’s the deep woods so none of our phones worked.  No reception in the woods.  No one in the woods.  We got in.
 
The compound.  No one could ever figure out what it used to be.  All we knew was it was big, abandoned and no one except us kids went there.  Even cops wouldn’t bother trekking out there because there was no road a car could get on.  The place was covered in graffiti.  Dumb psudo gang shit.  There was a spot in the middle where there was a clearing for us to sit.  The moon.  There was no moon that night. No moon at all.  We walked in, all four of us and went straight to the middle.  There were hallways and rooms surrounding the middle.  Some were collapsed in on.  Others were bare.  Crumpled beer cans and used condoms.  Who would want to fuck in that place I have no idea.
 
They laughed.  I hate when they laugh.
 
We sat down in the middle and lit up.  Tim and Harold started telling jokes in the dark.  The lighter was the only way we could see anything.  When it got to me, I relit it and noticed someone had written GET OUT on the far wall. 
 
“Wow.  Someone’s fucking scaaaaaaary”  Mike said.
“Maybe we should have brought spray and wrote ‘But the smell is so lovely’ next to it” Tim said.
Harold just smiled.
“What was that shit written behind you?” Mike said.
 
I assumed it was more fake gang shit.  I hit the lighter and the wall was a good 20 feet behind me so I had no idea how Mike could see it.  I got up to go look.  I couldn’t have stayed where I was.  I couldn’t I couldn’t I couldn’t I couldn’t.
I got up and walked towards the wall.  I can still hear the rocks and debris beneath my feet.  I got to the wall.  I had never seen the symbol before.  It was an X, but it had some sort of tails on
 
GOD THE FUCKING SCREAMING.  EVERY FUCKING TIME THE SCREAMING THEY WONT FUCKING STOP.

I touched it.  I touched the wall and it burned my hand.  It burned my hand and made me yell.  Suddenly the lighter got pulled out of my hand and I hit the ground.  Hard.  I could feel my head smash against the debris and I yelled.  Then they yelled.  I could hear them being tossed around like I was.  I could hear dripping on the ground.  Clawing and screaming and IM GOING AS FAST AS I FUCKING CAN.  IM TALKING ABOUT YOU. DOESN’T THAT FUCKING PLEASE YOU.  TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU FUCKING DID TO US.  HOW YOU TOOK EVERYTH

I didn’t even get to say goodbye to them.  They dragged them away before I could even see them.  All that was left was blood on the ground.  Huge amounts of blood.  Splatters and pools of it.  Horrible horrible pools of blood.
 
They kept me alive.  They’ve kept me here.  They brought me this.  Because no one has come here for months.  And before us no one was stupid enough to do what I did.  Touch what I touched.  And they are restless.  So FUCKING IMPATIENT.
 
So now
 
So now
 
IM FUCKING TRYING.
 
So now they are coming for you.  They’ve been feeding off me to make them strong enough to leave.  Leave the compound.  But they need somewhere to go.  I think if they wander they’ll get lost.  Dissipate.  Evaporate.  They need some sense of another person.  So they made me find you for them.  So they could sense you reading my words.  They left some here and sent the others to find you.

06/30/2009
v 0.01
+ Mob planned

Notes:
Today I started work on a mob most unheard of, a ""friendly mod"". I'm excited and I can feel as if it's going to be a hit!

Journal:
I fell in love with Minecraft after the first block. I've always wanted to create something so I figured a little companion like mod would be fun to do. I asked a close friend of mine to help me, and he agreed. He's a bit of a code monkey while I mostly focus on design. I decided for a feline, to rival the wolves in the game. More specificity, a cat. It would be the first known mod, nay first known mob that would be friendly to the player at start.



Changelog:

07/10/2009
v 0.05
+ Sounds created
+ Model added
.
Notes:
We hit a milestone, sounds were done smoothly, yet they did prove to be a challenge. The model could use some work, I may have fudged up on the legs.

Journal:
With having no cat around, I couldn't have just recorded one, most likely would have turned out badly as I don't even own a decent microphone. So, I may or may not have ""liberated"" a few sounds from the internet. Oh well.



Changelog:

07/14/2009
v 0.10
+ Textures created
-  Model edited
+ Scripting started

Notes:
The model was fixed up, a bit more cat like now. Decided to start on the textures now, figured to make the cat a black and white tomcat. The cat's now ingame, but it doesn't really do anything.

Journal:
I remember a cat I had with from childhood, he was like my best friend. His fur was pure snow white, with just some black markings here and there. Truthfully the main reason behind this was to relive my childhood, playing with my fluffy cat. If there is an afterlife, I bet he's smiling. If a cat could, that is.



Changelog:

07/18/2009
v 0.11
- Scripting halted
.
Notes:
My friend just up and quit. He didn't even say why, Didn't talk much but he seemed to be in a hurry. I was handed over what was currently done. Sadly I don't know a thing or two about scripting, so it's pretty much useless. I'll have to find a new member

Journal: N/A



Changelog:

08/05/2009
v 0.15
+ Scripting Resumed

Notes:
So after a long hiatus, the mod finally resumed. I couldn't find anyone to finish, but my friend luckily came back. He told me something about a family emergency and told me to delete the script I currently had. The report was that the new and finished script should be done shortly.

Journal:
N/A



Changelog:

08/13/2009
v 0.20
+ Scripting Finished

Notes:
Scripting is finally complete. I was told that there were some changes to things, and that he won't tell me, due to it would ruin the surprise. Also I was told that events take place over Minecraft days and nights. I wonder what they are. I'll start testing tomorrow.

Journal:
N/A



Changelog:
08/14/2009
v 0.20
+ Alpha Testing

Notes:
It's been three day's in Minecraft time, and I have yet to come across the cat, or anything new.

Chatlog:
MazZ:  Apsalus you sure you finished the scripting?
Apsalus: Of course I have
MazZ: Well I haven't seen anything
MazZ: I don't think you even did squat
Apsalus: How many days have passed?
MazZ: About three I think.
Apsalus: Then that's why.
Apsalus logged off.



Changelog:
08/15/2009
v 0.20
+ Resumed Alpha Testing

Notes:
Once day four hit the atmosphere seemed to change. It's hard to explain but I felt like I was being followed. Once night hit my game started to make eerie noises. This however was normal, as  I was one of the unlucky few who managed to build their home on top of a cave system. Nothing from my mod yet. I'll give it one more day before I contact him again. 



Changelog:
08/16/2009
v 0.20
+ Resumed Alpha Testing

Notes:
The sounds seem to be glitched, as it seems like they are following me. I'll just submit a bug report to Mojang or something. Day six came, and with it my game screen started to act up. All warpy and wavy,  as if I was standing in a Netherealm portal. I'm even hearing knocking at my shack's door, and scratches at the windows. Going to stop at day seven. Apsalus has some explaining. 

Chatlog:
MazZ: Apsalus what exactly did you do?
MazZ: I have yet to see the cat, but my game seams to be messing up.
MazZ: I know you're there man, answer me!
Apsalus has logged off.



Changelog:
08/17/2009
v 0.20
+ Resumed Alpha Testing

Notes:
Well the sounds and screen glitches stopped, that's good I guess. Day ten came with a little surprise. While I going to one of my shack's windows, something came up on the other side. Made me almost jump out of my chair. The eyes, it looked like it didn't have any. It was all black, with small white pupils. The face was in a creepy slasher like smile. A small uneasiness fell over me, as if something was telling me it knew I could see it. But that's just impossible. It's a game character! I think. I have a feeling Apsalus behind this, and when I get my hands on him I'm going to, I don't even know what.

Chatlog:
MazZ: Well this is great.
Dr. Panis: What now?
MazZ: Something happened in my game. Got frickin scared by something Apsalus may have done. I can't even get a hold of him.
Nanji: lol
MazZ: Shutup Nanji.
Dr. Panis: Well he's on if you wanted to talk to him.
MazZ: Thanks Doc

Changelog:
08/18/2009
v 0.20
+ Resumed Alpha Testing

Notes:
The noises have seem to come back, and I think it's following me but this time it's not just noises. It sounds like words. I can't understand them but I know it's words. I think this mod may be messing with my sanity, as I'm starting to have the same feelings outside the game. It may sound crazy, but what if that thing is real. It can't be. Apsalus is a prankster. He's just messing with me.

- Deleted Mod

Notes:
I deleted the mod today, I think I may take a break from Minecraft for a while.

Journal:
It seams as if I can't even run any other programs on my Computer other than Minecraft, and the feeling keeps getting worse. I'm letting a game get to me. Perhaps I should just beat the damn thing and show it who's boss.



Changelog:
08/20/2009
v 0.20
+ Picked up Minecraft

Notes:
With that thing uninstalled I tried to enjoy Minecraft today. Everything seamed normal. I went out to get wood for adding onto my shack and when I came back my door was open. I know I always close my door when I leave. It happened again later when I was exploring a cave. Must be another update bug.

Journal:
While the ""oddities"" in Minecraft have stopped, I still hear the voices. Sometimes it seems to follow me, yet when I turn around there is nothing there. It's even happening ingame. When I come home, some days I find my door unlocked. Just like in Minecraft. I've asked my neighbors, but they never see anyone but me enter or leave my place Maybe, just maybe it's all in my mind. 



Changelog:
08/21/2009
v 0.20
+ Resumed playing
Notes: While returning from a cave in Minecraft, I come to my blocky home to again find my door open. I drew out my sword, to find nothing inside. It was getting dark, so I decided to rest my character. As soon as it fell dark something appeared at the end of the bed. It was the same thing I saw peering through my window. I have a bad feeling that it learned how to use doors. After awhile the screen went black, and my character woke up to daytime. I looked around, nothing was there. I decided to quit for today.

Journal:
At 1:00 AM I awoke from my bed, I was paralyzed as I felt something gaze at me. I looked around the room, and that's when I saw it. It's not just in Minecraft anymore. It stood there, at the foot of my bed, it's sunken giant black pit of eyes, with what I assume was a white pupal, staring into what felt as my very soul. It had hair, jet black, its face a permanent cheshire smile. It showed its teeth, while uttering what seemed to be a laugh. I looked away from its face. The body looked mangled and thin, deep cuts were around the body with what I thought were ragged black robed draped on its frame. It was exactly what I saw in the game, only real. I blacked out, and when I came it was daylight.



08/22/2009
Journal: I tried to leave to go somewhere today, but I couldn't. The door that separated this house from the outside world acted as if it was locked from the outside. I gave up after a few minutes of trying to bust the door down, the only result was me hurting myself. While heading to the PC I could have sworn I heard movement. I started Minecraft, hoping that maybe, if I somehow beat this new mob, that it will leave me alone. I started the world, and loaded at my home. I stocked up on everything. Food, armor, weapons, I was ready. As I headed for the door, I tried opening it. It wouldn't budge. I tried to break the door, I only broke my sword. I tried breaking the walls, same result. As I was about to break the window, something stopped me. There it was, on the other side, mocking me. It was disturbing, but it was getting jollies from seeing me struggle. I heard a laugh from behind me. Not in Minecraft, but from where I sat. I turned around, nothing was there. When I went back, the face was gone from the window. I packed my things back into the chests. While I was halfway through, I heard the door in my Minecraft home open and shut. I ran there fast, I was staring at the door, then with a loud swipe, my character fell over dead. Minecraft closed itself and that was that. And that's when I realized. Everything that has happened in Minecraft, happened to me a day later in real life. Tomorrow I'll die, but I won't go down without a fight dammit. The creature taunted me with a message, a new one. It was hard to make out, but I think it told me it's one weakness.. knowing now is too late. I type this hoping that if I fail, one will succeed.  He can only be in one ""world"" at a time. If he's in Minecraft, he can't be in our world. If I only found this out sooner.

Journal:
I awoke from my sleep to hear my bedroom door open. I was ready. The day before I had stashed a revolver under my pillow. By instinct, I grabbed it, and my eyes darted around the room, searching for that figure. With a shot he missed me, and with one foul swoop I ended his life. But, with him gone I have no one to play with. He wasn't much fun anyway.

the sky is out of sight;  
the ambient glow of the restless city  
is the only source of light.

I lie in my bed, kept up by my thoughts  
on the sounds of traffic below,  
when a great cloak of darkness cuts me off from my city,  
her night lights ceasing to show.

I wait for a moment for the black to subside;  
it defies my wish and remains.  
Spreading like ink over all in my room,  
like the shadows whose visage it feigns.

Now with my room completely blacked out,  
it acts; it goes for the kill.  
It leadens my limbs, and deadens my shriek,  
and the room goes deathly chill.

Slowly, in leisure, it creeps up my neck,  
I feel it traversing my chin.  
Here it reaches my half-open mouth,  
and seeps insidiously in.

But it doesn't stop there, it proceeds down my throat;  
my lungs go icy cold,  
then all of a sudden they're fully stopped up,  
it has me now; it grows bold.

But as it goes on to diffuse through my body,  
something inside me turns;  
paralysis replaced by the will to survive --  
good timing. I need air; my chest burns.

With one last great effort as my vision goes spotty  
I haul myself off to the right,  
and switch on the lamp with a thrash of my head;  
the room once more fills with light.

The malevolent shade dissipates with a howl,  
leaving as quick as it came,  
but one thing is certain: so long as I live,  
I'll ne'er see my city the same.

I wish I could move.

I was diagnosed with sleep paralysis when I was 12. Normally when you sleep your body puts you in a sort of paralysis, but for me I am often still awake when my body puts me in that state. Ever since that day I've been aware of it's presence.

It's always the same, I'm lying there in bed when suddenly I can't move. I try to yell out but my thoughts can't make it into actions. Then it slowly leans over me, with it's horribly sickening frown.

I told my Doctor and he explained that it was probably hypnagogic hallucinations, a common side effect of people with sleep paralysis. I want to believe him, but it just . . . feels so real. The slimy cold of it's skin as it presses an oversized finger on my head can't be just my imagination.

It just sits there staring at me with it's finger pressing into my forehead for almost an hour before it's frown slowly form into a smile and it opens it's massive mouth.

""Not ready yet.""

Then it just . . . slips away. Soundlessly.

It was an odd dream. In my dream, I was a tall man that loomed above everybody. My neck was crooked to an angle that no natural human's neck should turn. However, this did not seem to bother me and, even upon seeing my reflection; bent over sideways as if I was a horseshoe, I smiled at my handsome figure. 

I was in a deserted town (or perhaps it was just late and quiet). I took my labored steps down the sidewalk and turned my body; back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, so that I may see my surroundings. I recognized this town! I would drive through it on my way to school everyday. I remembered the local stores and shops that always looked slightly decrepit, and the abandoned hotel that would never be demolished. However, it was not the town that seemed to interest me. I shuffled my stubby and creaking legs with as much vigor as possible toward some destination, I did not know where yet. Then I awoke. It was dark and quiet except for my alarm clock which laminated the time in a blue dead light; 1:28 in the morning. I lay my head down again, closed my eyes, and dreamed again. 

I was tall and crooked again, this time shuffling down the side of a road as cars rushed by unnoticed. After a few minutes of shuffling and turning I realized something; I recognized this street too! I would drive down this street from my house to get to town. Just then, I tripped and my bent form fell into the pavement. As I tried to struggle my way up I turned just in time to see a pair of lights rushing into my face. There was a crunch and a scream and I awoke with a panic. I gave myself a chance to breath and get a drink of water before I lay my head down again, closed my eyes, and dreamed again.

Again I was tall and hunched over sideways. My vision was blurry and red, but I could recognize my surroundings as I shuffled on, my bones creaking and breaking as I went. This was my neighborhood! My house was just to my left! As if the dream had realized this as well, I turned my resisting body to the left, and scuttled across the street. I was standing at my door when I awoke to footsteps in the living room. 

It must be the dog.

I entered the dream again, I limped across the living room and into the long hallway. I was awoken again by light streaming through my bedroom door.

It must be the dog.

I slipped into the dream once more, I stepped down the hall as blood seemed to drip from my sideways face. I turned and stopped at my door and was startled into consciousness by the rattling of my doorknob.

It must be the dog.

This time sleep was unavoidable and the dream came again. I opened the door and could hear my long, bendy spine groan as I stooped under the doorway to my dark room. I creeped to the bed to see myself sleeping lightly. I closed the door and the only light in the room was from my clock. I could hear my lips smack as a large grin game over my twisted face. Then I awoke, stretched, and opened my eyes.

It wasn't the dog...............................................









There was a crooked man
Who walked a crooked mile
He found a crooked six pence
On a crooked stile
He bought a crooked cat
That caught a crooked mouse 
And they all lived together
In a little crooked house

He killed the crooked cat
And ate the crooked mouse
And with a crooked grin
He left the crooked house
To walk a crooked path
To stalk the crooked night
Revealing crooked wrath
And unleashing crooked fright

Beware the crooked man
And his crooked moans

I had to wake up at 6 AM to get ready for school, I felt very...energetic...and stressed, like I was supposed to do something important that day, but I had no test's, Exam's or anything in between so I ignored it mainly.

I also had forgotten a lot about the Night before, in fact, I didn't even remember going to sleep that Night.

When I got to school, my Girlfriend wasn't there, she is **ALWAYS** at school, very studious, like me. My friends, for the most part, were also absent that day. I started feeling very uneasy, like, Pre-test nervousness. Again, I shrugged it off.

I got to my 1st period Calculus class, and everyone **I** hated were there, no one but the exact people that I hate and the ""douchebags"" of the school that many under them in the Social Hierarchy of High School hated, I know Hate is a strong word but nothing else describes it.

A half and hour into class, I went to the Bathroom. I saw a known Goth walking into the Bathroom and became slightly hesitant, those guys are not to be messed with, much less looked at funny. I went in and tried to piss as fast as I could but the Goth guy went into a stall and started.... whimpering. An Administrator walked in moments before I left, he knocked on the stall door and asked who was in there. No response. He unlocked the door and there he was, cutting his arm. He had slightly nicked an Artery and passed out from the blood loss, I heard the EMT's say they were taking him to St. Francis Hospital, this stuck with me for some reason...the name of the hospital.

3rd period rolled around quickly this day, we had an assembly and I felt so stressed I went into the Bathroom and threw up. When I walked out, everyone was in the Gym, waiting for the assembly to start.  I fainted. 

I woke up to the smell of smoke and screaming, I was standing upright, feeling full of energy and hyped up. 

The entire Gym had been set of fire. 

Newscasters were everywhere and 4x as much Police and Ambulances. They grabbed me and took me to a squad car. 

I was then taken to St. Francis, were I learned that half the school, 500 people, had burned alive and died, almost everyone else had suffered terminal burns and smoke inhalation related injuries. 

But I was unscathed.

The Doctors told me that my parents were going to arrive in 20-30 minutes. Then I remembered. That Goth kid, Jason I believe was his name, was next door.

I went into his room.

As soon as he saw me, he became.....fearful. I asked what happened and he screamed at me ""I prayed to him! I wanted them GONE! *All of them*!

""What do you mean?"" I asked

""I prayed to him...to kill them *all*""

""To who?"" 

""I bought the book and it's *YOU*, you are the one who was supposed to do that, *YOU*!""

""Calm down"" I said ""Who did you pray to? The Devil?!""

""He said...the Guardian...to the gates..""

""Who?!""





""........I......I...prayed to God""

That's when it all hit me. I was planning it all last night. Told my Girlfriend and Friends not to go to school tomorrow. I didn't faint, I set the fire on all the exits and entrances. I killed them. Me. All by myself. The students there, all had things going for them, Scholarships, College, one of them was studying to find a cure for Cancer!

God....God didn't want that but all I want to know now is..

What gates am I the Guardian to?

It never ends.
My only articulate output is writing.
It's writing which keeps me alive.
For through writing, I can escape.
The many worlds I can jump into to are far greater than the dull, monotonous life I find myself unable to stray from. Day in, day out, it never ends.
Same clothing every day, it never changes. But that's the way I like it.
I don't know many people, but that doesn't bother me.

There's this one woman but she doesn't mean much to me.
I had two other friends, but I haven't seen them in a long time,
now I'm left with just the one.
For both the social and the physical world are terrifying to me.
I don't understand them, and what I don't understand terrifies me.
Sometimes I can blame too much on the autism I was diagnosed with as a child.
Self centred they call me, childish. I can only respond with a slight mumble.
I wish I could speak my mind.

I can't even do the simplest things correctly, and when I try to fix a problem, when I try to use my initiative, the laughter comes, it always, always comes.
As a child I would confine myself to my room to escape it. Since I have been a young man however, that hasn't worked. It still comes, the same laughter, a chorus of hysterics. It was in this confined state where I made my best friend; one of my toys. To this day he follows me wherever I go.That includes the adventures I find my self writing, it's us, together, no matter what.

Concerning the laughter, I know it's probably a cruel joke my mind has crafted fuelled by social paranoia, but I want to believe its something more. What if the laughter is a signal that there's something more to this world? I need there to be, I can't take the reality I'm faced with any more. I'm getting more hopeful by the day.

You see, as I go about my monotonous, dull life, I have gradually felt more and more like I am being watched. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of hearing the laughter all the time and both things are purely psychological,  but I choose to not believe that, what other choice do I have, do I just confide myself to this apathetic and incredibly depressing reality forever? No, I won't do that.

The feeling of being watched lead to me looking over my shoulder more often, quickly turning around, I was trying to catch ""something"" out. One day, finally I saw something. 

It was late at night, and the feeling came over me again. I live in an apartment block in the city. I've always enjoyed watching society from above, despite knowing I can never fully feel a part of it. I did my usual tricks, checking in unusual places, moving unpredictably, rapidly. In the end it was the simplest thing that made me spot something peculiar, a mirror. For I have a mirror parallel to the window in my kitchen, with my back turned to the window I noticed a red dot, floating outside my window in the darkness, and a dark silhouette behind it, on the 4th floor.

The silhouette drifted in an out of view, and when it was visible it was barely so. I began to wonder if the silhouette was purely my imagination, for a moment cascading into a sea of depressing thoughts as I lost hope of these things meaning more than me being totally insane.

I pulled myself out of that with a simple realisation, the red dot was constant. It  was not a laser pointed from afar or a faraway light source of any kind, its source was just outside my window and there was a faint trail of red light leading into my apartment. I stood there, staring into the mirror, most people wouldn't notice the red dot I thought, in the dead of night. I began, to move, predictably. Acting how I would normally act, every so often glancing for a second to see if the light was still there. Sure enough, it was. 

Finally I thought I'd turn around, confront whatever this is, make it aware I knew it was there, I wasn't scared, I was finally going to get answers. This is the kind of moment I could only write about until now. I hastily turned around and peered straight towards the red dot. Instantly, it backed away, back into the darkness. But for half a second there, I definitely saw it, the silhouette outside my window on the 4th floor, I have my proof.

There is more beyond this life. I'm growing tired of living these worlds only through writing, I'm adamant there's something more for me, beyond.
Some people will label me stupid, as they have done all my life. But this time, I know they aren't right. They are cowards for not being able to make such a leap faith. I'm adamant there's something more for me, beyond death.

Goodbye to a world I never belonged in.

He chooses his victims throughout the centuries, and before he kills them, he forces them to tell his biography. All who ear the story are ones to die, and they too are forced to tell the story. His last known kill was in 1889. A woman's voice was heard over an early telephone. The conversation was transcribed, and the last words were ""He made me tell you."" both the woman and the man transcribing her story were murdered. In 1600, Abimor's biography was made into a play. The playwright was found dead, and the last line of the play he was working on was ""He doth forced me to share his tale."" In ancient Egypt, they found the first mention of him. He was described as immortal and narcissistic. The last hyroglyphic was an apology of sorts, but by then it was too degraded to be fully translate. His identity remains unknown to this day. But as sure as ther are people to victimize, he will be there.

Sorry for the shitty quality of my storytelling, as i am on my phoneMy friend told me this story a few days ago. He sent me a text yesterday apologizing for telling me the story. He was found murdered with his whole family today. My mind's all over the place, and I can barely think right now with the loss of my friend.

1327629187.0,27,self.creepypasta,oyhu4,Snuff Film,XanCrews,40,13,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/oyhu4/snuff_film/,"Of course nobody believes in Snuff films. It's just too sick to be real, right? Nobody in their right mind would actively produce evidence against them like that, let along make money off of it. Al Goldstein, publisher of Screw magazine, has a standing offer of one million American dollars for the one who can find a real, commercially sold Snuff movie. The offer has been in place for years and nobody has claimed it. And for good reason. I mean, you don't buy a carton of cigarettes and then sell it for half or a third of the price, do you?
Besides, as far as I know, nobody has ever taken one of these films home, seeing as they aren't sold as everybody thinks. That's too much of a risk. You pay to view a screening of it. Nobody ever held a copy of these films, except of course for the few people who make money off of them. As far as I know, there are only three, all male. Actually, the only females involved in these movies are the victims. Not all movies contain rape or sex of any kind, but it's not uncommon, especially with the few starring children as victims.

This all may sound a bit odd to a lot of you, but of course it does; it involves something that just can't exist, right? It is, though, very hard to get to attend one of these screenings. You need to be invited, and everyone who's ever been invited has been invited by personal mail, i.e. not via the postal office. The letters are apparently drenched in some chemical that makes the paper dissolve after a certain amount of time outside the envelope, possibly in contact with air or light - I don't know. All I know is that these people are clever and they take their measures. If they knew who I am, they'd surely kill me, maybe even make me into movie star. Then I'd be shown in their little cinema. It's quite a dark place, seeing as the only lights are candles situated around the screening room. The entrance to the Snuff cinema is that of a decrepit, old factory, reminiscent of a slaughter house. The letter would have short instructions as how to get to the screening room. The projector itself, apparently hooked to a recently bought DVD-player, is powered by a car battery. I've been told they used to use a small gas engine back in the 30s. The 'chairs' are the same old tables that were once used as slaughter benches. As soon as the screening is over, all the guests, maximum 10 or so, are threatened to leave immediately through 3 different exits with 30 minutes intervals. The exits are different from the entrance, as they lead to underground tunnels, probably old sewers, that lead to back alleys in different parts of the city. The crew, i.e. the people with the films, quickly vanish, probably through a fourth exit. If you manage to find the screening room after a screening, you wouldn't know it was ever used for anything like that. It just looks like a walk-in-freezer with white walls, meathooks still in the ceiling, and of course the tables, still with obvious marks of old, dried blood.

There are about 120 Snuff films to be viewed in just this one cinema (and there are probably more throughout the world), each categorized by victim, method of killing, whether sex is involved (and whether it takes place pre- or post-mortem) and by ""level of brutality."" At least one film is of young, blonde women being choked to death while performing an unwilling blowjob. Another of a young child being cut open while drugged just enough to not move, but enough to still audibly and visibly be awake. Yet another is of a man hung upside down on a meathook, then having his testicles removed with a machete and force-fed them before he dies from bloodloss.

I could go on and on about these movies as I've seen a good portion of them. Why not? I have the money for it. The goriest film I've seen was that of a middle aged dark haired woman having her hands, feet, arms and legs amputated while drugged, then sewn them crudely back on at the wrong extremeties. The next cut showed her wriggle in terror as she tried standing up on her arm-feet until she collapsed and vomited. A door behind her opens and a male figure swings an aluminum baseball bat at head. On impact, the head bent and she let out a gurgly cry before going limp and silent. The angle of the camera changed and the man hit her head again, this time bursting it open with debris of brainmatter. A crying child was then shown eating her eyes. It was the most satisfying movie I've ever made.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,black,True,t3_oyhu4,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/oyhu4/snuff_film/,

Well, I have a little idea of it. People die at all ages, and of all types of causes. Sometimes it's by injury, sometimes it's by disease. But sometimes, old men and women just die in their sleep.

Sometimes, old people just die without warning in their sleep. They were perfectly healthy, just old. There really is no explanation for why they die, but they just die. There was a little test done in the 1950's, to see if they could explain this. They took 10 test subjects who were at least 80 years old, and asked them if they would stay here, in this facility, until they died. These people were particularly aged; you could tell they didn't have long left.

As each one died, something peculiar happened. Just before their heart stopped, their brain readings became incredibly erratic. But, they still matched a certain pattern. They matched the pattern of a person having a nightmare. But, this was like nothing they've ever seen. These readings were like the readings of someone having the worst nightmare anyone had ever seen. Their faces stayed so perfectly calm, along with their bodies...but they were not calm.

But, one of the test subjects survived. He seemed like a very resilient man. He had the brain readings, same as the others, but his heart did not stop. Instead, he woke up with a scream, and jerked up violently. The scientists rushed to him, and asked what had happened in his mind. He said it was the most terrifying thing anyone could ever see. He said that it was the reason people die in their sleep. He said that dying in your sleep was not peaceful. He said it was the worst experience you could ever have. And as he was about to tell them...his eyes rolled back in his head, and he collapsed onto the bed. He had died from exhaustion. His heart collapsed completely.

The scientists were baffled. The project was stopped there. They refused to put any more people through this experience. The results were locked away, and the project was hidden away from the eyes of the world. It was lost in the government machine, for the public never to see. But, one of the scientists was not satisfied with this. Many years later, that same scientist was of the age where he could die in his sleep. He remembered the project years ago, and decided to find out what the old man was about to tell them. He spent quite some time preparing his old heart for anything that could come at it. He wanted to make sure he stayed alive through this. One night he went to sleep, same as always. But this dream was different. He was in the dark. But there was a small light emanating from what seemed to be a bathroom.

He seemed to be drawn towards it. He couldn't stop himself from walking towards it. He opened the door. There was one small flickering light, a dirty looking mirror, a broken down toilet and a shower, which seemed to be in the same condition. The floor was cold concrete. There was a sink. He felt himself forced to wash his face with the water. It seemed perfectly normal. He looked up from the sink into the mirror, and saw himself. He looked perfectly normal as well. He wiped his face off, and reopened his eyes, and saw his reflection again. But it was much, much different this time.

The person in the reflection seemed to be him...but it was different. It was as if someone had taken him out of the grave around 6 months later. The figure was decayed, but still retained some resemblance to him. The scientist was paralyzed with fear. But not paralyzed enough to stop from fulfilling an incredible urge to reach out towards it. He slowly moved his hand towards the mirror. But, instead of having his hand stopped by cold glass, it kept going towards the figure. He whipped his hand back with incredible shock and fear. The figure slowly started to speak. He said in a raspy, degraded version of the scientist's voice ""E-everyone h-h-has their time. Y-y-you were lucky enough to last this long. B-but your time has come....prepare y-yourself"" the figure moved towards him. He looked for any escape whatsoever. But the door had disappeared. He was trapped in that room. His fear completely froze him from any movement. It suddenly rushed at him, screaming with a more terrifying scream than you could have ever imagined in your entire lifetime. As soon as it made contact with him, he woke up. He sat up violently, heaving massive breaths.

The scientist realized immediately what he has just experienced. He quickly grabbed a piece of blank paper that was sitting on the desk next to him. He had prepared this beforehand, just in case. He scribbled out these words as quickly as he could, for he knew that his heart was about to collapse. The paper said ""DIE BEFORE YOU SLEEP"". He then threw the paper and pencil down, and expected to die right then. But he didn't. But he looked over to the exit from his room. Standing in that exit was the figure from his nightmare.

The figure whispered ""y-you didn't think you c-could get away that e-e-easily did you?"" The scientist's eyes widened with terrible fear. He managed to whisper ""what...what are you?"" The figure rushed towards the side of his bed, and whispered in his ear ""I am god"". And with those words, the scientist died.

The scientist was a lonely man. All of his family was dead, and he had but one friend. Nobody found the body for months. But, one day, his friend came to visit. He went to his house, and knocked on the door. No answer. After a few seconds, he smelled an incredibly horrid stench coming from the house. He walked around to the back, and looked in the bedroom window. Inside, it was dark. But he could make out the decaying figure of his friend, who had been in there, dead for months. The figure almost exactly matched the one that had caused him to die. He called the cops, and they picked up his body. The cause of death was simply labeled ""Old Age"". But they found the paper next to his bed. It was filed away in evidence, and there were a few local newspaper stories about it. And so everyone kept on believing that dying of old age was natural, and dying in your sleep was the most painless method to go by.

I walked along the small room in which my subjects were bound.  One man and two women stripped of their clothes.  It was quite a sight to see.

I turned the older man and women towards each other and removed their gags. They screamed “HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!”  It seemed like great fun so I joined in.

In the middle of all the yelling, I picked up a scalpel from the work table.  I walked over to the man and proceeded to stab his Adam’s apple until it was nothing more than a bloody pulp.  I watched the blood flow from his neck and hit the floor.  I was as though someone had left the faucet partly on.  The pool of blood spread quickly across the floor.  The woman stopped screaming and watched, horrified.  The man’s eyes fluttered closed.  I felt his chest.  Still beating.

I proceeded to make a shallow incision from his belly button to the middle of his chest.  I peeled away the skin and threw it on the woman watching.  I laughed as she violently tried to shake it off.  She wept bitter tears.  I walked over to her.  She spat on me

“Oh no no no.  You need to learn to play nice,” I said.  I replaced the scalpel with a bone saw.  I turned the table on which the woman was tied so that she could see herself in the overhead mirror.  I replaced her gag and put on my mask.  There would be an awful mess and lots of screaming.  I didn’t want to disturb my other patients.

I made quick work of that one, wasting no time in sawing off both of her legs while she screamed through her gag.  I ran my hands over her bloody stumps and proceeded to run them up her stomach, smiling.  “Refreshing?” I asked.  I slapped her in the face with all my might.  She squealed and began passing out.  I quickly grabbed a syringe containing adrenaline and administered it to her.  Her eyes lazily opened up again.  “I wouldn’t want you to miss the show,” I giggled.

Her arms were the next to go, falling to the ground from her chains with massive thuds.  I smiled as each one fell.   She cried ever so bitterly.  I walked over and grabbed a teddy bear from a nearby shelf.  “You have to be a strong girl now.  We wouldn’t want Teddy to be sad, now would we?”  I placed the bear next to her head.  She concentrated her gaze at the mirror.

I walked over and tore off her right ear.  I applied too much force and fell backwards.  I laughed as I threw her ear behind me and dusted myself off.  I threw away the saw and left her there whimpering with Teddy.

The third woman had seen the previous treatments the other two had undergone and became frantic as I looked at her.  I walked over slowly.  “Don’t worry,” I said.  “I’ll let you live.”  Her eyes glimmered with hope.  I took a butcher’s knife from the table and handed to her.  She looked puzzled.  “You have a choice,” I explained.  “You may end that miserable woman’s life over there, or I will perform the same surgery on you as well.”  She looked at the knife, then the woman, and then nodded to me.

I removed her foot binds first.  How can I trust a woman with a knife?  I removed the bound hand not in possession of the knife.  I walked over to the table the legless woman was on.  I pushed over the table and yelled at her. “GET THE FUCK UP YOU LAZY BITCH! Oh, right. My bad.”  I laughed at my own joke.  I was hysterical

I picked up the legless woman and sat her down on the table next to the woman with the knife.  “Well, you know what to do.”

The exchange of the final two victims always fascinates me.  A silent conversation in which the victim pleas with the potential killer to let them live and go after me.  It makes me blush and get all giddy when I think about it.

The woman with the knife gauged out the eyes of the woman with no limbs.  I watched her slump over, covered in her own blood protruding from her eye sockets.  I looked over at the woman with the knife.  I walked behind her, all the time congratulating her.  I took the arm holding the knife and snapped it as far back as it would go and then some.  I twisted her arm off and smacked her in the head with it.  I then took the knife and slit her throat as she fell out of consciousness.

I put the knife down and walked over to the stairs leading upstairs.  I looked back at the victims: my father, skinned, my mother, limbless, and my wife, slit throat missing one arm.  I’m just glad my kids, who were watching through the viewing glass got to see what fun daddy could have at work.

The body swings softly. The figure S piercing the legs' tendons, dull and grey, grates lightly, metal on metal, a body on a hook on a chain. He approaches again, knife in hand, and punctures the skin. Not sure if that's the right spot, he thinks, should have looked this up before, but he's started now so he'll finish. The knife slides in. It's not sharp enough for a clean cut, but at he works it back and forth the skin peels back like a blood orange. He smirks at the joke. It's quick work, especially for his first time. Soon he holds the skin in his hands, heavier than he thought. Thicker too. The body stares down with its mad eyes at its own blood splattered on the grate beneath it, its lipless teeth fixed in either a grin or a snarl. Hard to tell now. He mimics the expression as he lifts the head in his hands, cocks his own to better examine it, and lets it slump down again. He spreads the skin out flat on the table, leans in close, eyes to empty eyes. It rises to meet him, as if a hand were lifting it from below. Cold and clammy, it presses against his naked body. The skin shrinks beneath him. It curls and tightens, wrapping itself around his limbs, his back, his neck. So this is what it feels like. It seals the seam, almost seems to sigh as the dressing is completed. He lies there for a moment, savouring the feeling. Warmth returns to him, to his new face. He stands and goes to the mirror.

Our podcast is weekly and it's existed for a little over a year. We've obviously had time to cover quite the variety of topics. At one point, we had an episode completely dedicated to creepypasta. As a joke, we had said that we wanted something to happen to us that could be defined as creepypasta. We even said the words ""we want a crazed fan.""

Boy, did that happen.

**Hello, ymmas  noscut**
_____________________________

On January 1st, 2013 we received an email from the comment section of our website. The email was received with no subject, it came from someone that used the name *ymmas noscut.* (Sammy Tucson backwards. I'll be referring to him/her/it as that from here on out) Seeing as it didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary, I opened it. Inside was an mp3 attachment labeled ""Message1""

I listened to it and instantly knew we were in for quite the trip.

The attached file was a series of layered white noise loops with the phrase ""A hard winter is coming"" repeated over and over again.

You can listen to it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx-c4oehaDM

Jeff, Bill and I got a little rush out of the possible introduction of the crazed fan we always wanted, despite the fact that it almost felt like a threat. This was just the tip of the iceberg.

**The First Images Arrive**
_____________________________

The following day, we receive another email. This one had a subject line that read ""?gninetsil uoy erA."" Attached were three images. Each with a file name referring to one of us. They seemed to be kaleidoscope images of something. Was this a call for help? A plea for attention? Who knows, but at this point we were starting to kind of enjoy it.

**Sammy Tucson Likes Reddit, too!**
_____________________________

Some time had passed without much excitement from Sammy. Until one day, a post showed up on our subreddit.

http://www.reddit.com/r/PopularOutcasts/comments/17zlwt/winter/

This was the image that appeared in our kaleidoscoped images! It looks like the culprit is from where we're from, so we assumed it was probably a local, maybe a fan screwing with us? We weren't sure.

_____________________________
**Evolution**
_____________________________

The original Sammy Tucson files seemed almost primitive compared to what we received later in the game. After the basic kaleidoscope images, we began to get tarot cards every few days.

These began to concern us more than we had been used to.

We received two more messages from Sammy in our email. They can be heard here as well:

The phrases you hear are:
""We're going to be the best of friends, will you come play with me?""

""We want to show you that hell is a real place, and you will see it.""

**A Quick Wrap-Up**
_____________________________

Things continued to get stranger and stranger for us. To this date, we have no leads. It took us a while to mention Sammy Tucson to our listeners, but we got into it on a recent episode. Our fans are **loving** it. Everyone has turned into a super sleuth. Theories are pouring in and we've even had two copycats create some images. Or so we assume.

[Copycat Sammy Tucson Images](http://imgur.com/a/lRY9v)

The copycat posts weren't appreciated by the real Sammy. This was posted by Sammy quickly after:
http://i.imgur.com/gMF93XG.jpg

_____________________________
**Conclusion**
_____________________________

After rereading all of this, it all seems a bit muddy. This is fitting. We have no leads, there are fake Twitter accounts and Reddit accounts being made. We're starting to lose a grasp on what is actually Sammy and what isn't. Sammy has even contacted the fake accounts with this image. Maybe he's angry? Maybe she's going after the copycats now? Or maybe, just maybe, Sammy is one of us.

Even we don't know. I'll be sure to keep everyone updated if the interest is there.

**tl/dr: We have a crazed fan/stalker of our podcast. He/she/it sends us images and mp3s that creep the hell out of us. None of us know who is doing it.**

EDIT: As I mentioned, some of our fans are even getting into the mystery. Here's a huge theory as posted by lookitssupergus. Some of the names and events may be confusing, this was posted on our podcast's subreddit. It just goes to show how people are getting involved.

It was a nice day outside, especially just after a week-long storm. I had spent almost every Saturday in my local game shop, Slackers. The place was just local, I think; I hadn’t seen any other stores. The Shelves always had weekly stock, something new to check out. They even had music sections that I would occasionally browse. The owner of the store was pretty mice, at least 30 or so, pretty laid back. I had just gotten a Game Boy Color which was a bit after its release (2000) so I went, as usual to the game boy cartridge section.

There was an interesting cartridge on the very top shelf; I was only 12 so I couldn’t quite reach it. I found the stool that was kept around here somewhere and was finally able to reach it. The cartridge was hard to take off the shelf, almost stuck on there. After about 30 seconds of prying it finally broke off. The cartridge was still intact. The cartridge had no label, just simply whit ten in sharpie “free”. I basically just shrugged and asked the owner about it.

“Is this game free?” I said with a surprised look.

The owner took it from me and just shrugged as he saw the label

“I guess it is.” He then handed it back to me, and then went back to reading his magazine.

I put the cartridge in my pocket as I began my usual round of the new stock, all the usual stuff; Pokémon, Kirby…Stuff like that. After I realized I couldn’t buy anything anyhow, I went home. All the way home I was stangely intrigued by the blank cartage, I was ready for anything. When I got back to my room it was just as I had left it, typical 12 year olds room. Spiderman posters left and right, supplies ready for school on Monday, and my old clear Gameboy on the bed. I jumped into bed and popped the cartage in; while it was loading I was expecting some crappy game that never took off.

The Menu was what looked like an 8 bit field of grass; A setting sun in the distance. There was also no title, just in big bold letters “START”. I pressed start and almost instantly placed on a flat plain. The sun in the menu was now at the very top of the screen. My character had a hat and a t-shirts on, pretty pixelated. I began to walk forward with the arrow button and soon encountered a block. I touched the block and instantly died. I was taken back to the menu. The next game I played the sun seemed lower by about 1 pixel. I figured out that “A” was jump so I jumped over the first block that killed me. The same process happened for about a minute. Finding a block then jumping over it. I encountered a pit after a while, just 1 block wide. Seeing no challenge I jumped. I hit some sort of invisible wall and fell into the pit. I press the start button on the menu. The sun seemed about 3 or 4 pixels lower, nothing too odd; it just unnerved me a bit. I came to the pit, which seemed to have come earlier. I got over the pit this time, feeling a bit accomplished. After a bit of walking I came across a sign; the sign was very detailed for a GBC game. The game told me to press B to read the sign.

“Don’t let the sun set…”

The sun, by what I had noticed, had been setting more and more each game. I wondered what happened if you did let it set without completing the game. I just touched the block over and over again. Each time the sun setting more; the screen getting darker. My heart was racing, I felt so rebellious, which was a mistake. The sun finally set, the screen almost pitch black. I touched the block and died again. The next time I played it was broad daylight in game. I just began to walk, and walk…and walk. I seemed so into absolutely nothing. I felt myself getting absorbed into the game. I was just walking.

So one day the world blacked out. I was placed in a game store, and waited to be picked by a kid again. I was picked and played, interesting kid. So I was walking, then I ran into a block and died. The next kid suffered the same fate, but I felt a decade-long spell being lifted as he did so. I was free. So that made me wonder, am I nothing but some sick and twisted game, doomed to walk a plain for the rest of my life, doomed to pick up cartridges in game shops? Maybe it’s not so bad; taking a walk sounds nice, doesn’t it?",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_132nhm,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/132nhm/simple_game_first_oc/,

Jenny walked into her home at a slow trudging pace. Her dark eyes squinted against the morning light. Dropping her bags next to the entrance, she swiftly kicked her foot back against the door and lazily felt for the lock. Jenny heard the clicking of her dogs toenails on the hardwood floor in the upstairs hall. Shuffling a few more feet further, she flopped into the plush chair next to the stairway. She kicked off her flats and rubbed her feet over the living room carpet before propping them on the foot rest. Jenny closed her eyes and rubbed her temples while her dog raised a staccato beat in the hallway before finally coming down the stairs, only to yelp and rush back up the steps. Her eyes began to open at the worrying sound and she caught a glimpse of the white fur vanishing past the wall that blocked the steps. She rolled her eyes and closed them again, lacing her fingers together and resting her hands on top of her stomach. Trixie could be such a goof, especially when Jenny came home after working nights.



Trixie paced in the hallway upstairs over and over again much to Jenny's dismay. She felt too tired for this today.



""Trixie baby, do you have to go pee pee?""



The dog ran down the steps halfway. Jenny raised her hand in an effort to pet Trixie but fatigue won out and her arm flopped back down onto the armrest. Sitting there, she could feel the dog boring holes into her head.



""C'mon, let's go pee."" She mumbled turning her head, but Trixie raced back up the stairs before she could open her eyes. ""Alright, guess you're just hyper today.""



Jenny listened to her dog, no doubt scratching up the floor by the way she was pacing back and forth, for another minute or two before yelling out, ""Alright Trixie! Just go to bed, mommy will be up soon!""



To her relief she heard the dog run through the hallway and under her bed where Trixie usually liked to take refuge. Jenny let out a sigh of relief at the same time she heard a whimper come from next to her chair. Her eyes flew open and her brow knitted. Staring down in confusion, Jenny saw a trembling Trixie staring up in fear.

Adam heard these words while he was surfing the web going through everything scary he could find although at this point nothing could scare him.

He was strange to be a 14 year old boy. He was very insensitive. Adam knew what that call meant. Adam's mom had always worn glasses and was pretty much blind without them. Her name was Maria.

Maria had always used that exact phrase when she was looking through something and needed help seeing letters. Adam thought nothing of this usually and started to advance down the staircase to help his mom but that's when a feeling sprung up inside of him and made him rethink his decision.

""Mom, I'm doing something important I... I'm sorry, I can't help right now,"" faked Adam.

Adam didn't hear anything back for a few seconds until out of the eerie silence of the night he heard a horrible scream. Adam's first thought was that his mother was hurt so Adam sprinted down the stairs into his dear mother's room as quickly as he could and that's when he saw his mother just sitting in the rocking chair that was always in the corner of her room. Adam almost let out a scream because of the extremely horrifying look on his mother's face as if she was dead but still rocking back and forth. Adam felt that feeling that he felt earlier again, but stronger. The feeling kept burning inside of Adam and growing as he realized how scared he was.

""Did you need me, Mom?"" Adam cried with tears on the verge of shedding.

The thing in the chair just kept sitting there for about ten seconds until out of nowhere.

""Why, yes!"", it replied in a horrible, eerie, devious tone.""Yes I do.""

The thing in the chair sat got up quickly and lunged at Adam. Adam was suddenly on the ground with the creature on top of him. As Adam fought for his life, the thing stopped trying to kill him and stared him in the eye. Adam started to scream as loud as he could as its eyes fell out and it fell over on the floor. That's when Adam noticed something horrible. His mother's skinned body was stuck to the ceiling with her intestines hanging on by one rib. The last thing Adam hear was these words.

""i nee'D your Eyes A'Dam, can you please help me?""

It was early in the morning when the old man with the funny hat came by. I stayed close to mamma. He drove here in a large truck with a big canopy on the back. He leaped over the fence into our yard.He ran towards mamma and she ran far and fast but he kept chasing her! What was I to do? I was just a child! I could see in the distance the man with a rope around mammas neck keeping  her from running again. He gathered her into the back of his truck as I cried and screamed for mamma to come back and for him to let her go. But he kept walking. Mamma pulled away with all her might but didn't make a sound. He started making his way towards me and I froze up. I didn't know what to do. If running didn't save mom then it wouldn't save me! He pulled me into the truck too, and Pushed me up beside mom. I watched thorough the holes to see what he was to do next. The same thing. He went to everyone's yard and took them too. How did he make it so simple? Soon everyone I knew was stuffed in the back with mom and I. We all screamed in terror. We came to a town where there were many people. We screamed and screamed but everyone ignored us. A few times a man or woman would nod their heads at the strange man driving. What kind of sick town was this?! It became dark as the hours past. We eventually pulled to a stop. Everyone was settled down and talking to each other calmly by then. We soon heard a clinging sound coming from the door. It swing open. There he was once again, the strange man with the weird hat. He had ropes around everyones necks now. He grabbed two at a time and led them away into a large building. We waited. Mom and I were last. He shut the door behind us and took us into the building. Two men were there waiting for us. They grabbed the ropes from the strange man and took us separate  ways. I started screaming again. I cried. We kept walking though and I couldn't see mom anymore. He came to a stall and pushed me in. I could see mom on the other side of the building in an identical cell.  She was crying. Told me she loved me and shut her eyes. The men walked towards her. They Killed her. Right in front of my eyes. I stood in shock as my heart fell to the ground. They took her body to a large machine. Put her in it and let her get ground up. It was a horrible day. I was waiting for them to do the same to me when they came to my stall and said I was to young yet. ""put her with the others."" one man demanded. The other two followed his orders and led me to the truck again. There weren't very many left. All kids. That meant something. We were silent, knowing all our parents were dead. I sat and waited. There was no speaking until we got back home. We all agreed never to speak of this. We went on with our days. But none of us were ever the same. We grew older and had children. I knew the day would come again but I wouldn't be the one to come back home. I was right. It did. It was a younger man this time. I didn't struggle like mom did. I just went. My son was soon pushed up against me and the others were not talking. Only the children were screaming. We all knew the day would come. And here it is. The men were at the building again. They were much older now. I was put in the same stall that I was in when I was young. Where I watched my mother die. I cried again as I looked at my son who was in the stall my mother was in. Did my mother see her mom die too?  Will my son die later? I knew I would never know as the three men Slowly murdered me. It seemed it was no big deal to them. Just a murder.

It had been him, in the mask of course, the same who had taken young sweet April, Ben and Kathy too. He let them suffer, cutting deep enough, but shallow so they would slowly bleed it out, but not die right away. It was awful, him and his shiny pocketknife as he lured the young teens to him, then prepared the attack in lashes, and they tried to struggle, it couldn’t be helped, a curious bright girl, against a cold hearted killer. 

And, someone else, today, it would be the day. He watched, from the shadows, his face blank, white, expressionless, into a crouch as he simply adjusted his tie with a long, slender limb. When the killer was gone, it came out, a black suit perfectly fitting his skinny body, kneeling near the teen. Without eyes, he still saw her wither, choked upon her own suffering and pain, unable to mutter a word or even a screech. 

He pressed one of his thin fingers to her, many tentacle like objects grew upon his back, the life being ripped from the female, quickly, without pain, taken to perhaps better places, or perhaps to nothing at all but a peaceful darkness, but now, he new, she lay there, eyes rolled back into her skull, now, she was finally away from distress and misery. 

Swiping a hand across her face, her eyelids closed, getting up and peering around with his head of nothingness. He wanted that killer; to make him feel the aching.

The suited figure walked, sluggishly, as he would slay, but without regret. However, this person, this morbid human, would not die for a while, in which, this was not something he often did. Usually, he only take the lives of those who were left in the forest, and were suffering, to be taken away and have mercy.
But he deserved this. 

His walk turned to a run, as he spotted the executioner. 
“Who are you?” The muscular man growled, his rage pounding in his voice, drawing the knife towards the suited figure, although, his pupils small, as if fear had begun to flow through his veins as well.
The weaponless thing said nothing, however, waltzed to the life-taker, his tentacles wiggling from his back. “Stop! I-I’ll stab you!” He crept closer, just as much as the criminal stepped back.
A twig sprung to life, the trees grew faces, a thick mist formed around the battle, vines wrapped around the man, ripping at his jeans as they deep into his legs, the blood squirting onto the now wilting grass. “What the he-” He was interrupted, the skinny thing wrapping a hand around his throat, clutching as hard as he could, bursting the windpipe. 

Tempus mori.” The creature said gently, pressing the mask-like head against the slayers, “Et meum osculum mortis.” The voice was deep, sending a shiver down the killer’s spine, unable to respond in oral, as his vocal cords were now a bloody mess, pouring from his mouth. 

It was the last thing he had heard, slashes deep on his abdomen, tangled in the weeds, mangled and helpless. 
The Slender Man stood there, watching, as the man was now the one to suffer. To cry red tears, to be locked away as nobody could help. He had his own game now, planted onto his body.
The suited figure disappeared in the shadows, as the deaths of the young ones would now fade away from his deed. But he knew now, if spotted, they would think he did this, to the girls and boys, to the killer. He laid his blank face upon his chest, hidden in the darkness. 
Because things weren’t always as they seemed.

The Teetering Man doesn't know when his end will meet him, and neither do I, Everyday for about five minutes I shutdown all the power in the house, remove the spoon from his mouth and feed him. He doesn't know how himself. The Teetering Man is the product of a relationship I had with a woman long ago. Twenty years ago the Teetering Man was born. He last saw sunlight twenty years ago, when he killed my wife and left me with a life off loss, pain and suffering. So all he has ever known was pain and suffering. He will never see sunlight, he will never have friends of family, he will never know relief or comfort. All he will ever know, is pain, because when I die. he dies too.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1343313547.0,,,True,t3_x490x,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/x490x/the_teetering_man/,

1340572584.0,29,self.creepypasta,vjf75,The Reapers ,MrsPyramidHead,48,19,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vjf75/the_reapers/,"You’ve heard of Death, right? The Grim Reaper?  Of course you have. The creepy figure in a black cloak and scythe, looming over the sick and the dying. That’s how they want you to see him. A myth, a metaphor for death, nothing more.  I’m not supposed to tell you this. I’m really, really, not supposed to. It’s probably the worst thing I could do. Then why, you may be wondering, am I telling you at all? Because I believe that everyone deserves a fair warning. A fair chance to change their fate.

The first thing you should know is that death is not a single being, but many bodies acting as one. This is so that they can see all, at once.  They refer to themselves as “Reapers”, in tribute to the Grim Reaper persona. They judge a person on their character and behavior harshly and efficiently, having no mercy and no care for life. They are the ones who can send you to a peaceful afterlife, or to rot in hell.
 
Also, you may not be able to tell who, or what, is a reaper and who is not. Reapers usually begin to appear around children in middle school, though of course there are exceptions.  One reaper is assigned to maybe 100 or so children, so the child:reaper  ratio, if you will, is quite unbalanced, and I suppose that it a good thing. There are maybe 2 or 3 reapers a school class or grade, and in adulthood, maybe 1 or 2 in the office/workplace.

Now, this part is very important, so pay attention. Reapers are never the popular ones, or the rich ones, and are seldom nice to be around, and very quiet. They are the kids/adults people dislike, and the ones who people tease and ignore. The freaks, geeks, and loners.  The kids that no one really knows or cares to know where they are from, or who they are. Are there a few kids from your childhood sticking out in your mind yet? 

There are also physical things to look for, but have extreme caution while observing people that you think may be reapers, because if they are in fact reapers, and they notice too much attention from you, they can and will watch you much more closely. Firstly, their skin is slightly more pale than normal, not a sickly white like movies portray, but instead a shade lighter than everyone else’s. Their veins also sometimes are more visible under the skin that a healthy human’s should be, and their nails are barely purple, as if they are very sick. They also have a tendency to mutter things under their breath. The final and most obvious thing is that sometimes, rarely, you can see their eyes glaze over and turn a slight gray. This means that they have sealed a fate of someone in the room. Chosen when and how they will die, and where they will go after that. 

	Now what do you do with this information? I’ll tell you what you do. You start to figure out who the reapers are in your life, and start to shape up and be a model human being around them. Hell, suck up to them if you want. When it comes to eternal judgment, being a suckup is probably a smart choice. Don’t tell anyone you read this. Don’t trust anyone. If someone mentions this to you, say you’ve never heard of it. You never know when they could be testing you. How do I know all this? I cannot tell you. I wish I could, but I can’t. I’ve already said too much…",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_vjf75,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vjf75/the_reapers/,

Now you are standing outside the abandoned office building wearing a backpack with a flashlight, a pair of replacement batteries, and your brand new camcorder.  You are a little afraid but you rationalize your fear because tomorrow you will show your classmates footage of this building.  **Everyone says it’s the creepiest place in town.**

The first thing that hits you when you walk into the building is the musky smell.  The air is cool and damp and your footsteps echo loud in the building as if it were a cave.  You scan the room with the flashlight.  The crumbling walls are bare and the ground is littered with papers.  The rooms have no furnishings.  You take a deep breath and begin walking around the first floor.  The building is dead silent, except for the echoes of your footsteps.  The concrete walls and floor actually seem to amplify the sound as you go deeper into the building.  No matter how softly you move the sound of your footsteps fills the place.

You are filled with adventurous excitement.  Soon you have completely walked through the first floor and recorded every room with your camcorder.  Sunlight pours through the windows and illuminates many rooms.  All of the rooms are empty.

The last door on the floor doesn't open up to a room but instead to a concrete stairwell that descends into darkness.  You turn your flashlight on.  There is nothing down here.  Dread grips you as you take slow steps down, down, down.  Once at the bottom you survey the room.  Empty.  At the far end of the room is a doorway that leads into an even darker hallway.  You slowly walk towards the doorway accompanied only by the loud echoes of your footsteps.  Down here the only natural light dimly pours from the stairwell.  Before you enter the next room you spin around and check the room behind you.  Empty.

Surprisingly the next room is even darker.  As the narrow cone of light slowly scans the room you see a pile in the corner.  You pick up each object and film it.  It’s mostly old office supplies and you take the only interesting thing:  a half used pack of matches.  Unable to contain yourself, you strike a match. You let it burn to your fingertips before dropping it onto the floor.  Suddenly you are reminded where you are.  Anxiety grips your heart for just a moment.  Just before you turn off the camcorder you realize you only have enough battery for a few more minutes of filming.  **I’ll just film until I run out of batteries**.

Again the next room is darker than the last.  It isn't even really a room, its a long and empty hallway.  You step, step, down the hallway, chased by echoing footsteps.  At the very end of the hallway there is a second set of stairs that go down even deeper.  The floor down there is dirt, not concrete. 

You take a deep breath.  Each step down the stairs is quieter and quieter until the echo is completely muffled by the bare dirt floor.  You scan the room slowly from left to right and see a large collection of desks and chairs piled neatly.  You only have a minute or two left to film so walk into the room towards the desks.  After each step you check the stairs behind you.  Fear has you expecting to see some figure standing menacingly at the top of the steps.  Nothing.  Then you see it.  At first it was a glance out of the corner of your eye but it quickly draws your full gaze.  Far off at the end of the room is a lone white mannequin posing with its hands in front of his face as if the light from the flashlight was blinding.  Your heart drops and you want to run outside, you don’t want to be here anymore.  But you are compelled to stay and finish filming.  **This IS the creepiest place in town**.

You walk slowly towards the mannequin at the end of the room.  You are flanked on both sides by orderly office furniture that completely encloses the room.  The mannequin itself is surrounded by chairs knocked over on their sides.  You walk until you are a foot away from the figure.  You film the figure for a moment.  Up and down and left and right, zooming in on its ugly grey hat.  The camcorder shuts down. **I'm done.**  You check behind yourself again and unzip your backpack.  As soon as you put the camcorder in your backpack the flashlight goes out.  Your heart stops.         You quickly flip the switch, nothing.  You do it again and again and again, and it does not turn on.  The room is unimaginably dark.

**It’s not a big deal.  It’s fine.  It’s fine.**  You stick your hand in your backpack and feel around for replacement batteries.  Your hands are shaking so hard that it’s hard to screw the top back on.  You flip the switch.  Nothing.  Again, again, again, nothing, nothing, nothing.  **Maybe they are in backwards.**  You unscrew the top again but then you notice the footsteps.

Step.  Step.  Step.  You stop moving.  Your eyes widen.  You weren't hearing something.  There are definitely footsteps above you, someone is in the building.  You feel the blood draining from your face.  You know that no one goes here, no one knows you are here.  You go back to changing the batteries, the whole time steady footsteps echo above you.  You flip the switch.  Nothing.  **Fuck, fuck, fuck.**  You just sit there stunned.  Your eyes are wide and your hearing is focused on the footsteps above you.  You hit the flashlight against the ground desperately.  Nothing.

You pat yourself down in desperation for a source of light.  **Matches!**  It takes almost a minute of you fumbling in the dark to get the match to light.  The whole time the footsteps are echoing in your head.  The light is blinding at first but after a moment it lets you see the room again.  You quickly scan the room.  Nothing.  You quickly but quietly move towards the stairs.  Towards the footsteps.  You don’t want to go up but you cannot stay down here.  At the foot of the stairs your match goes faint.  You drop it and light another.  Initially the light blinds you but your eyes adjust quickly.  **Please don’t be standing at the top of the stairs.**  He isn't.  You check behind you.  The light is too faint to fully see but you see desks and chairs.  

**Okay.**  As you walk up the stairs you start to hear your own footsteps.  You try desperately to walk quietly but each time your foot hits the concrete the sound reverberates and amplifies off of the walls and fills the building.  You know whoever is down here hears you but you can’t stop it.  You want to call out, but your voice doesn't work.  It takes you forever to get up those stairs while you vainly try to quiet your steps.  Half way up the other footsteps stop.  You stop and listen closely, huddled close to the wall.  They definitely stopped.  Now the only sounds you hear are your own feet as you step, step up the stairs.  By the time you reach the last step the match has gone out.  You take the match pack out of your clenched fist and strike another.  The paper is damp with the sweat of your palm but it the match lights nonetheless.  You look around the room in front of you.  When you see the mannequin standing motionless in the corner you want to cry.  **This wasn't here last time.  Someone moved this.  Someone moved this.**

You sprint out of the room, as fast as match lets you.  The next room has a milky white mannequin in it too.  You can barely make out where the room ends but you can see the milky white skin of the mannequin contrasting against the consuming darkness.  Again the light goes out.  You take out another match.  Two left.  When the light comes back you make out the outline of the room and move towards the doorway.  It opens to another room with more fucking mannequins.  They are standing in terrifying poses, naked and white.  **What the FUCK?**

You don’t remember where your backpack and camcorder ended up, but you don’t care.  You only care about getting the fuck out of here.  As you turn the corner, you find another room and your light goes out.  As you strike the next match you are once again blinded and the room slowly becomes visible.  The most horrifying thing you see in this room is not the four mannequins huddled in a corner but the stairs.  Before faint light washed down the steps, now the steps lead to more darkness.  You run up them and trip.  The match goes out.

Your hands are violently shaking as you strike the last match.  You look back, you think the mannequins moved.  **No.**  The stairs lead to an unfamiliar hallway.  There is no light up here.  You sprint down the hallway.  You turn the corner; another empty hallway.  Then the last match goes out. 

Your heart is racing.  You can feel it beating in your head.  Time is lost in this panic.  You are feeling the cool wall with one hand and holding the other one in front of your face.  You realize that you have been crying.  You don’t remember when you started.  Then you hear those footsteps again.  You are screaming but you cannot hear yourself you can only hear the footsteps getting louder and louder and louder and closer.  You are basically sprinting right at least until you trip.  Your momentum launches you tumbling down the stairs.  Each step sends an echoing crash down the hall.  At the bottom your body falls onto the soft dirt floor.  It feels cool against your bare body.  You get up and knock over some chairs in a panic.  Then you hear it.  The FOOTSTEPS are at the top of the stairs.  They descend down slowly.  Step.  Step.  Step.

Your voice is trapped in your throat.  A bright light fills the room.  It is so intense that it burns your eyes and you have to protect your face.  You are too terrified to move.  The light is held by a terrifying figure who slowly approaches you.  It's wearing your clothes.  You don’t move an inch.  He gets within a foot of you and shines the light up and down your naked milky figure.  Then he takes his ugly grey hat off and puts it on your head.  “This is the creepiest place in town.”",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1cfwso,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1cfwso/footsteps/,

Or... It felt like I was strapped there, I really couldn't move my head more than a few centimeters in either direction to see what was holding me down. It’s starting to get harder to take each breath, it’s too much for me to handle... I’m exhaling in an attempt to scream for help but no sounds are coming out of my mouth that I can hear. I can feel my vocal chords ache as though I’ve screamed for hours. Maybe it’s been that long, I can’t really tell.

My eyes are adjusted to the darkness, the tubes and wires draped across the walls are dripping with condensation probably has a lot to do with the dank odor I’m smelling.

I move my lips and I can feel the air cross my aching throat but it’s no good...

I’m pretty sure I’m in a vehicle of some sort, the gentle purr of everything vibrating like an engine is running or something is actually kind of nice. It’s helping me sleep through this.

I had a breakthrough although not what I had hoped for. I managed to break something behind my head and move my head more than I had been able to prior. I have about 5 more inches of movement and when I move too far I feel like something is shocking the back of my neck. The pain is instantaneous and very excruciating.

Something is cutting into my right arm with large hypodermic needles coming out of a large tubular structure, I try to keep my imagination from running away from me but this thing looks like a 4 foot long caterpillar complete with a green body and continues from the table(?) where I’m located into the wall.

I saw a man in the corner of the room, and he managed to break himself off the table he was laying on. I was sickened at the sight of what I was sure was holding me down, there was something coming out of the table that was mounted in the back of his arms, calves, neck and head. He was very strong from what I could tell, he managed to break off all of the connections to the table and started to walk towards me. I can see his mouth move but I can’t hear him say anything to me, I’m sure I was screaming at him but again I couldn’t really hear anything. He took about 5 steps before realizing that the “caterpillar” was still attached to his arm and he didn’t have enough slack to make it to my table. He gently pulled away from the caterpillar tube and I can see the 30 or 40 hypodermic needs slide out of his arm. The look of abject horror on his face made me wince as I try to not get sick on myself... I haven’t eaten in so long, what would I get sick on myself with?

He had freed himself of all of his bonds. He staggered over to me looking disoriented, shaking his head like he’s dizzy and incoherent. He started to work on my connections freeing me, just as he finished on my arm and neck connector, he crumpled to to the floor into a fetal position. His bluish colored face and purple lips indicated suffocation. I frantically reached over and felt under my left arm to see what was holding me there. Jesus, was I next? Why am I not dead? I stared at the caterpillar tube for a moment, what am I breathing if it’s not oxygen? Not exactly a good situation if your scared of needles like I am.

After freeing my self from the table, careful not to touch or even look at the caterpillar tube, I swung my legs over the edge. Man that thing grosses me out. Sitting up and looking at the dried bloodstains where my head was on the table I know I did some damage back there, but let’s try not to think about that right now.

My stomach tightened up, I can feel my testicles start to draw up to my abdomen like I had a bad shit coming... I double over in disgust and pain as I start to come to terms with what’s in front of me. A dead man on the floor, strange surgical items laying next to my bed, I have strange things embedded in my flesh. Where the fuck am I!? I curled back up on the table like the dead guy on the floor and start to cry, dry heaves making it so hard to breath.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1288qv,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1288qv/an_interesting_nightmare_i_had_a_while_back/,

I heard this story once as a girl when I was at a slumber party. I have not heard this story told by anyone else before, I have even looked it up online several times and cannot find record of this ""urban legend"" anywhere. However, it is still to this day one of the only stories that will make my throat swell up and my eyes water. I wanted this story to not be forgotten, as good urban legends usually die out with time. This is my attempt to preserve it, and to add on some extra details to make this story feel more alive to the reader.

Not too terribly long ago there was an American businessman, we'll call him Mr. Brown. He was the CEO of a newly established investing firm. Due to his job having assets and partnerships in many places in Asia, Mr. Brown did quite a bit of traveling in the East with his company, and was recently spending quite a bit of time in Japan. His latest business deal had really taken off, and he was due to meet with another firm in Tokyo to buy some wealthy real estate with much potential. 

This last deal essentially fell into his lap, and Mr. Brown eagerly purchased the next available flight out to Tokyo to meet with his new business partners and discuss closing the deal and allocation of property, renovation, etc. He caught a cab to the airport and quickly checked through security, making it just in time to grab a cup of coffee and a magazine and breeze through to his first class seat. 

Everything was going smoothly until he was informed that his connecting flight was delayed due to maintenance issues, and he would have to wait at least another five hours before he could get back into the air again. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the meeting would have to be put on hold until Mr. Brown could arrive, as nothing could be done in his absence.

Finally, when he landed, red eyed and exhausted, he phoned the hotel he was supposed to be staying at to let them know to send a taxi. The woman on the other line informed him, ""I'm sorry Mr. Brown, but we have already assigned your room to someone else. It is very hard to secure a room here in Tokyo, you should have informed us hours ago. We tried calling you."" He had completely forgotten, in the midst of all the chaos and business planning, to inform his hotel that his flight was delayed...he missed his check in time. ""Well, where should I go then? I didn't plan for this, I'm exhausted, I just need a room."" The woman on the other line replied, ""Well, Mr. Brown, there is a hotel about two blocks down from us, the Jade Flower...it's not the nicest inn in Tokyo, and it will not have room service or any of the amenities like we do here. However, you may find they have at least one room available."" 

Without even thanking the woman on the other line, Mr. Brown hung up the phone and quickly searched for the number for the other hotel. He called to see if he could make a reservation for two nights, and thankfully, they had a room. 

He took a taxi to the Jade Flower Inn and immediately when he pulled up he could see the place was in dire need of repairs. The sign hung drearily from its post and the roof was damaged. It sat tight between what looked like a bakery and a small bookstore. However, it was an inn... and that meant there would be a bed...and that would have to do. 

Mr. Brown tipped his taxi driver and made his way inside. The inn was much nice than its outside appearance. The woodwork was lavish and ornate, with a dark oriental rug trailing all the way to the front desk. Mr. Brown dragged his suitcase along behind him and checked in with the drowsy looking old man behind the big wooden desk. He handed the man his identification and credit card, to which the old man nodded and pulled a pen out from behind his ear to scribble on some yellow paper. After a few quick grunts, the man handed Mr. Brown his key, labeled ROOM 12. Mr. Brown awkwardly smiled back at the man behind the desk and gave him a thankful but tired nod and turned to head up the steep staircase to his room. However, he suddenly paused when he thought he heard the old man about to say something. Mr. Brown turned to face him, ""I'm sorry I didn't hear you"". The old man returned his response with a rather solemn look on his face. He looked down at Mr. Brown's hand holding the key to his room, then back up at him. He then waved his hand at Mr. Brown, ""Nothing"" he said in broken English. Mr. Brown ascended the stairs towards his room, already feeling the warmth of his bed under his suit.

He fidgeted with the lock when he got to his room and clumsily swung open the door. There was something about the room that struck him as peculiar. It had all the decor of the lobby downstairs...but something didn't feel right. That's when he noticed it was the walls...they were made of rice paper! ""How strange,"" he said to himself, ""must be trying to keep with the 'vibe'"". He lightly dropped his suitcase down on the floor and turned his lights out except for a small lantern by his bed. He began to get undressed, fumbling with the buttons on his suit when he heard a soft ""click"". The light had gone on in the room next to him....and he could see the shadow of a figure faintly appear on the rice paper wall across the room. 

Mr. Brown froze for a moment, unsure if the stranger in the next room could see his figure too. His eyes lingered on the wall, as he kept his gaze on the shadow. It seemed to get closer and closer to the wall across from him until it formed a solid shape...the body of a woman. She was tall, very tall, and thin. She had long flowing hair that, even in the shadow, he could tell must have been black as night. The figure slowly sulked over to what appeared to be a vanity against the wall and sat there for what seemed like an eternity. Mr. Brown was scared to breathe, there was something about the woman that seemed...unsettling. 

He flinched when the woman finally moved, extending a long, spider-like arm across the table, reaching for a brush. She began to brush her waist-long hair. Over and over. Suddenly, Mr. Brown wasn't very tired anymore. He was curious, very curious. He could see her supple breasts jiggle in the dim light and she brushed.  Her hair, he could almost smell it. Mr. Brown's loneliness seemed to creep up on him in that moment. When was the last time he had felt the soft flesh of a woman against his own? He has been so busy working, trying to make a life for himself...but what life was this? He just wanted to know what she looked like...she didn't seem to notice him, standing there with his tie half undone and his mouth open like a buffoon. No one noticed him. 

So he crept up to the rice paper.

He made very sure to approach her shadow from an angle behind her, hopefully where she would not notice. He tested his insane idea first, and waved his hand in front of the paper...but she did not move. He lightly tapped the paper, a little closer to her figure this time, but still she did not flinch.

She just kept brushing her long, black hair.

Mr. Brown decided now was his chance, just one look. He licked the tip of his middle finger, and made a little transparent blot on the rice paper and attempted to peek through. 

But all he could see was red.

""Whatever,"" he thought, ""they must have some dye in the paper so creeps like me can't spy on beautiful women."" He then silently crept into bed, hoping the woman wouldn't hear him on the other side of the wall. He tucked himself in under the sheet, leaving the lantern on so as not to hint at his presence to the figure in the other room. 

He fell asleep to the sound of her brushing her long, black hair.

Mr. Brown awoke in a sweat, he had nightmares, terrible nightmares. His mouth was dry and his head hot, he was about to get up from the bed to get a glass of water until he heard a noise. A familiar noise. He shook his head to clear the fog, and looked over his shoulder at the room next to his...the woman was still sitting at her vanity. That's when he recognized the noise...she was still brushing her hair. It was nearly 4 in the morning and she was still brushing her hair. 

He slowly rolled back over and listened to the sound. This time it was not soothing...he slipped back into his nightmares.

Mr. Brown jolted awake to the sound of his alarm. He had overslept and was about to be late for his meeting. He rushed to get ready, throwing on his clothes and not even bothering to brush his teeth. He hailed the nearest taxi and flew to the office where he would be meeting his new partners. When he arrived everyone had been waiting on him. At first he panicked at the terrible first impression he must have made, but these men were young, no more than late twenties, early thirties...some even had sneakers on! They smiled and greeted him with handshakes, very different from the types of partners he had been meeting in other parts of Japan. They offered him a seat and hot coffee with pastries, they chatted a bit and then moved forward with the plan to excavate a large area of land and to use as a plot for several commercial buildings. 

Mr. Brown liked his new comrades, after sealing the deal and talking late into the night over sake, he had decided it was time to make his way back to the hotel. He and his new partners said their drunken goodbyes, and one of the men offered to drive him to his hotel. 

When they pulled up to the inn, Mr. Brown stretched over his seat to give his partner one final handshake goodbye and then slowly stumbled up to the door of the inn, silently laughing at himself and how successful the day had been. Mr. Brown briskly walked through the lobby, avoiding the judging stare of the old man behind the front desk, and clomped up the stairs to his room. 

He fumbled with the old lock again and opened the door, tossing his suit jacked onto the bed. Mr. Brown fell backwards onto the comforter, letting out a long sigh...when he heard it. The brushing.

He quickly looked over to the wall across the room, still stained with the tiny circle of spit he had left from the night before. He saw her...but this time she was different. She was maniacally brushing her hair, almost hitting herself over the head after every violent tug of the brush. Her body lurched over the vanity, he could hear her sobbing.

Mr. Brown trembled, his nostrils flared and his eyes began to water.

He was scared.

He watched the woman, wrenching her body in an almost unnatural way. Scraping her scalp with the bristles of the brush, tugging out clumps of her hair. Mr. Brown slowly and unsteadily approached the wall. He didn't know why he was doing this,  either drunken courage or sheer stupidity. But he had to know...he wanted to know what she looked like. This sick, sad, beautiful woman. Why was she doing this?

He approached a spot a little closer to her on the wall, waved his hand to see if she could see him but she only continued to brush her hair in rage. 

He licked his middle finger and made a tiny, transparent circle just like the one he did the day before...but all he could see was red.

At this moment Mr. Brown struggled for a flask he had left in his suit jacket and finished the remaining contents. He buried his head under his pillow and quietly hummed to himself. Anything to drown out that horrific sound. 

Mr. Brown awoke the next morning in a sleep deprived hangover. However, he didn't hear the woman in the next room. He breathed a sigh of relief and quickly got dressed and got his luggage together. Fervently trying to get out of the inn as quickly as possible. 

He grabbed his things and trotted down the stairs towards the lobby. The old man was at the front desk, huddled over a cup of dark liquid and a newspaper.

Mr. Brown cleared his throat. ""Excuse me, I need to check out."" The man looked up from his paper at Mr. Brown. ""Here, here's the key."" He tossed the key on the desk, in front of the old man. ROOM 12. 

Just as Mr. Brown started to leave, he turned to the old man...who appeared to still be staring down at the key that had just landed in front of him. ""I'm sorry,"" said Mr. Brown, ""I  have to ask you a question. You see, I was staying upstairs in Room 12, obviously, and I was wanting to know something."" The old man looked up from the desk. ""I don't know if you can tell me anything about this, or if you are allowed to...but there was a woman staying in the room next to me. In Room 11. From what I could tell, she was very tall and thin. She had long black hair. She seemed to be very beautiful. But she seemed troubled. She spent a lot of time brushing her hair."" The old man's eyes seemed to glaze over. ""I know this all sounds crazy,"" Mr. Brown continued, ""I just...I just want to know if you know anything...about her."" The old man slowly rose to his feet, picking up the key and rolling it over in his hands. He spoke in a slow, shaky voice, Mr. Brown strained to hear over his accent. ""No one stay room 11 in long time. One lady she stayed there, long time ago. She was Japanese kabuki actress. Very tall, yes, very thin. Had long black hair, down to here"" he motioned with his hand to his hip. ""She was killed in that room, in room 11."" Mr. Brown's mouth went dry. ""She killed in a bad way, by a man that follow her up there one night. He killed her and brush her hair after she die, brush it so hard it come out of her head, lots of blood."" Mr. Brown remembered the thrashing, the brushing.  ""That room, Room 11, not for guests no more, it's bad luck."" 

Mr. Brown shook his head forcefully and wiped his brow, ""No, I know what I saw. This jet lag and insomnia is playing tricks on me. This was a woman, a real woman!"" The old man leaned forward over his desk, ""You know, that woman...she was not famous because she was so beautiful, or her hair or how she was so tall."" Mr. Brown looked at the old man, puzzled. ""She had one thing no other kabuki actress had, no other woman in all of Japan.""

""What?"" asked Mr. Brown, becoming irritated now.

And in a low, hushed voice the man replied, ""She had red eyes.""",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1374687043.0,,,True,t3_1ixevk,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ixevk/room_11/,

This is my take on an old creepypasta I enjoy. I always wished there was more to the story so this is my effort at it. 

Clive walked down the dimly lit street in the French Quarter. Garbage was strewn threw the gutters and small, green puddles of water accumulated in the ancient paving. His worn shoes echoed off the uneven sidewalks and intensified the lonely feeling of deserted Ursulines Avenue. It was a few minutes before three in the morning and he could hear the faint noise from the bars on Bourbon a few blocks away. However, the echoing shouts and drunken jubilations of strangers no longer offered him a vague assurance of the existence of the outside world. He knew very well that he had crossed over into someplace else this evening. The veil separating the undulating crowds and himself had been drawn tight perforated. 

A gentle autumn breeze briefly made a halo of his cigarette smoke and whipped at his smartly cut, dark hair as it wound down the empty street. He drew the last of the life from his cigarette and flipped it into one of many questionable puddles accumulating in the gutter. It hissed softly when it landed. 

Finally, after six years of searching, he had found himself here. 

He took a right on Chartres and walked along the large concrete wall outlining the convent’s grounds. As he walked, he looked up to the large building that housed the convent of the Ursuline nuns decades ago. Not a single light was on. It was merely an office and museum now. 

Well, most of the time it was. On a certain night out of the year, a rare opportunity presented itself in the centuries-old convent. It had taken Clive the better part of a decade but he had finally claimed the knowledge that would allow him entry to the hidden gallery.

His gaze shifted to the closed shutters of the attic and the blessed nails keeping them shut. He thought of the fate of those poor women centuries ago as he walked deeper into the cool autumn night. 

As he passed the steps in front of old St. Mary’s, his nerves finally got the better of him. He paused for a moment to steel his will. This was no time for his courage to falter. He had read of the two girls in the 70s that had not known the proper steps of the ritual and had failed at the doorman. Their bodies were found drained of blood on the steps in front of the building. 

He approached the small wall between St. Mary’s and the next building and knocked sharply three times. His knocks were returned three times.

A voice questioned him, “What do you seek here?”

“The light of pure art,” Clive responded.

“Very well,” the voice responded dryly.

The wall squeaked and rumbled lightly. It was opened inward and Clive was allowed to pass. His inquirer was nowhere to be seen. 

The passage was dark and shadowed by the buildings on each side but a few feet down he saw a faint light streaming from underneath a door. Upon reaching it, he found the door unlocked. Once he entered, he found a worn, fully stocked bar complete with bartender and various other patrons obscured in the surrounding booths. 

He took the appropriate seat at the bar. 

“What shall you be partaking in this night?” the bartender asked warmly. He was a large, muscular fellow with dark, closely shorn hair and a handlebar moustache. His eyes sparkled warmly as he spoke.

“Absinthe,” Clive said nervously clearing his throat, “Absinthe, please.”

“What kind would you prefer, sir?” the bartender shot back.

“The stuff the Man himself could not bear to take,” Clive said slowly, making sure to get the words right.

 “Ah…” breathed the bartender, a look of solemnity washing over his face,

 “One moment then.” 

The bartender quickly ducked into a back room behind the bar. On his return, he was carrying an ancient looking green glass bottle. A thick layer of dust covered the bottle and its label had long since been reduced to shreds.

“Be sure you handle this drink with care,” the bartender warned as he poured the dark green liquid into a crystal glass with an ornate seven-sided rim, “For it is the best I have.”

When the bartender finished pouring half the drink, he placed an oddly shaped absinthe spoon on top of the glass and a sugar cube in the middle of the spoon. His job completed, the bartender placed a small glass of ice water on the bar next to Clive. As he looked closer at the spoon, he recognized the shape as a key. Good, Clive thought, I may yet survive the night.

Clive poured the ice water over the sugar slowly until the cube was no more and then stirred the glass gently with the key-shaped spoon. The liquid became cloudy. He removed the spoon key and placed it on the bar. After appreciating the beverage and glass for a few moments, he offered a nervous cheers to the bartender and downed the liquid closing his eyes to fully enjoy what could be his last drink. It was strong, herby and sweet, a premium absinthe. His knowledge of the ritual went no further than this. Whatever else that lay before him was from the whispers of madmen and facts had no place in their shadow.

Upon opening his eyes, he found utter darkness. He blinked. The darkness persisted. He thought maybe he was only supposed to have taken a small sip. Icy fingers of fear and doubt began to slip up and down his spine.

As the horrors of possibility ravaged his mind, he began to notice a faint green glow. At first he dismissed it as a trick of a brain deprived of visual stimulus but it steadily grew brighter.

Eventually, he could faintly see the bar again and noticed that he was alone. Green orbs of light flicked into existence and drew his attention to an old wooden door in the corner of the bar. The greenish light seemed to emanate from behind the door. 

Upon finding the spoon key again, he picked it up and slid off his barstool, making his way carefully to the door in the near darkness. Upon close examination of the keyhole located in the center of the door, it appeared his spoon key would fit. The door resounded with a loud mechanical snap as the key found its place in the lock. 

Clive tried to retrieve the key but it was stuck fast in the machinery of the lock now. The door slowly slid open to reveal the innards of a modern elevator and a beautiful woman bathed in the green glow. Clive stood stunned at her beauty.

“You’ve kept me waiting, English” she said slyly, winking a coy smile. He was bewitched and his nervousness intensified. She motioned him closer with a gesture of a finger.

Clive gulped, nodded and joined her in the elevator. She was tall and blonde with a slight frame covered up with a billowy, translucent dress. Holding the dress together at the waist was a thin green belt. She looks like a fashion designer’s wet dream of a fairy, Clive thought.
The elevator machinery clicked and whirred as the carriage began to rise upward. She smiled and it warmed him. Soon, they reached their destination. 

The elevator door slid open to a great marbled hall. Lamps lit with an unnatural flame cast a perfect light of clarity on the works that hung there. Clive was awestruck. Here was Beauchamp’s gallery. According to legend, this should be the attic of the convent yet it was so large that it couldn’t rationally occupy the same space.

I mean it hasn't happened to me before now but still. Okay here I go. It happened two weeks ago, you see I was walking to my shed to lay in Papasan chair and relax. Twenty minutes later I'm curled up in the chair covered in a wolf themed fleece blanket, when I hear a loud crashing noise outside startling me. How do I react? I jump, and fall out of the papasan chair my body rolling into the wood burning stove. Luckily for me it was a warm night and I didn't need to start a fire. I get up off the floor, and me being foolish I look out the small window to see a large white person submerged in the shadows. Think, about the teeth of a dentist a shiny white color. Eerie? Yes he was. His eyes were the crimson of freshly shed blood, and he was staring straight through the window looking me dead in the eye. I felt an intense pressure on my heart at that moment, it felt like it was being crushed within my chest. Every breath was getting harder, and more shallow. A pressure was building in my head, and I hear this raspy voice like nails being pounded into a gravestone, saying ""Let me in."", and at this point I am shaking I break eye contact, and run like a little child hopping into the chair and covering my head and body thinking it will protect me, attempting to block the words from this... this creature. ""I need to come in,"", it says the voice getting louder and more harsh. ""LET ME IN CHILD, I NEED TO COME IN."" This continued on for several hours his voice getting more malignant and distorted until I couldn't stand it and the pressure on my head and pressing against my chest was too much for my body and I passed out.

I have reached the gates of Hell. I entered without fear. I met the Lord of All Evil, and we made a deal. I got back to Earth, with a task.

I have to kill 665 people before I die. If I do so, I will spend eternity as a Demon King in Hell, with my own Legion to command. Of course, I’m very delighted by that prospect…

There is one condition, though: I cannot just kill random people. There is a trigger: if they hear one simple incantation involving my name, they are eligible to be my target. I managed to make my job easier, putting this spell into a book, a famous one, so that many people will probably hear it. I am very smart, indeed.

So, after you hear the deadly sentence, I will know you. And, when you are least expecting, you’ll see my shadow out the corner of your eyes. And when you turn your head to see what that was… it will be too late.

Coming home safe AND changed would be nice…but either way, I just want him home with me. I hope it’s soon.

It’s been too long without light.

I still remember the last time I saw him. He was so scared to leave me, so scared that he’d never come home because of his family’s “curse”…he didn’t want to die the same way his brother, father, and grandfather had died: shot in the side and drowned in their own blood. Maybe that’s why he hit me all the time…maybe that’s why the last time he had the gun…he was scared. Yes, that must be it…

I hated him when he hit me. I hated how it hurt. But most of all, I hated how I hoped he’d die, just like his father, grandfather and brother before him. I hoped he’d hurt when he died, hurt like he hurt me when he knocked me down and pressed the cold barrel of the gun to my temple, or my heart…or my eyes. My eyes…he loved them so, so much. He used to tell me all the time that they were beautiful…and oh, now he’s going to die because I wished it on him!

His mother always sits beside me when I’m quiet and thinking, blinded and hurting and grieving for him to come back. She says not to worry about him, or about the pain or the silence I offer her, because it will only make me worse. She tells me that he’s sent letters, and when I feel up to it I can read them. She tells me I’ll only get sicker, but how can I not worry? She did the same thing, she told me, and so did her daughter-in-law…they all worried. But they also wished for the deaths of their lovers…horrible because of the abuse. It saddens me to know that they all hit the women they loved. But we loved them back, nonetheless. ..I just wish I could read his letters. 
But how can you read with no eyes?

Aidan. I HATE you, you miserable bastard. Why’d you do it, why’d you take my eyes? Why did you shoot them out, put me in this miserable darkness, this “coma”? Why am I lifeless and you are alive? What is it that I did to you?


I hope you do get shot, you bastard. And I hope that you hear my voice, my cries and screams and wails from every time you hit me, and you hear me welcoming you into your own hell, Vietnam, and you relive the last time you saw me…when you shot my eyes out. And I hope that you can’t live with it, so you imagine a better scene of leaving, where you didn’t have to run from the room you put me in, bruised, bloody and lifeless with bandages over my face and the bloody, gaping holes where my eyes once were.

And I hope that you relive your death, over and over again, and each time you die you wake as if it were a dream, and you’re terrified. I hope I meet you in hell, Aidan Clark.

I call them Diamonds, the people that I watch. I call them that 

because they glitter. Something about them stands out to me, like a 

diamond among lesser stones. It may seem weird to use stones as an 

analogy for human beings, but I think its fairly easy to understand 

that like humans, most stones are pretty plain. The shape varies, the 

texture, I would imagine the taste probably differs for those who care 

to try. The point is just that, you can tell an ordinary piece of rock 

from a magnificent diamond. 


      I have had thousands of them, all hand-picked. There isn't a long 

drawn out process for how I determine eligibility. You either are one, 

or you aren't, and it's easy for me to see right away without even 

exchanging words. I should mention at this point before I freak anyone 

out, that I don't hurt anybody. Quite the contrary, I'm in love with my 

Diamonds. I simply watch from a distance as they live their lives. Kerri 

got married the other day, and although I wasn't invited to the 

wedding it was in fact beautiful. Scott fell off his bike this morning and 

he laid there on the road in agony for over ten minutes. I wanted so 

badly to go over and help him up, but I’m not allowed to make contact 

with them, only watch. It hurts me when they hurt and it makes me 

joyful when they are happy. Do I have favorites? Sure, if you asked a 

mother of three who her favorite child is, she'd respond by saying she

It was a part time job I would suppose, but I regret being that person. It was the end of the first semester. After leaving school, right at the bus stop, a fairly old looking man stopped me asking for a favour. I said “Alright,” and he showed me a brand new laptop. He offered it to me and said “I have a problem with my webcam, I have brought it to specialists but they don’t seem to know the problem.” In a rough voice. “I’ll pay you 500 dollars if you fix it,” he said quickly. I responded with an enthusiastic “Okay!” without thinking about how odd it was, an old man asking a high school student to fix a new laptop.

As I took it he said to me “Goodbye,” and rushed away. I found it odd in how much of a hurry he was in. Taking it home after completing my homework, I switched the computer on and started browsing. I hooked my webcam to it, everything seemed fine. It was easily taking photos of me, until I looked at them.

The photos of me had a mannequin slowly getting closer and closer behind me. I searched my entire house afterwards, my parents thinking I was insane, but nothing was there. After unhooking everything I was ready to turn off the monitor, when a pop-up came up, a link saying “Webcam”, nothing else. Clicking it mindlessly it took me to a deviant art page named ‘webcamman’. All of the photos were my webcam photos. Another pop-up opened saying “I am you”. Then suddenly all of the photos in his gallery didn’t have me in them, but me standing without emotion where the mannequin was. Scared, I rushed to tell my parents. When I got to their room, they were on the floor. They were emotionless mannequins.

Attempting to dial 911 I put the phone up to my ear, but there was such a loud burst in the phone, that my ears were ringing and I could barely hear for the next few minutes. Running back to my room, I had the idea to get on the computer the man gave me and try to contact someone via Facebook, as it was pitch black outside and I was in an isolated area. Turning on the computer and flipping the monitor up, I saw all applications in the computer were gone, but even worse. The desktop background was a picture of me on the computer right now at this very second, and the mannequin was right behind me.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1eps9r,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1eps9r/webcammanjpg/,

For the past 3 weeks, there has been a long streak of murders, totaling into the high 80’s. Nobody was ever alone in the home, with all the victims leaving one survivor behind. And every survivor has said the exact same thing.

“He had no defining features, except for his eyes. They glowed brightly, like two candles waiting for their souls to be drawn to them. He never smiled. He never showed anything. Just still, like a corpse. Except for his eyes.”

There was no clear description of the killer. Heights were different every time, features changed from incident to incident. The only constant was the eyes. And the fact that there was always one victim left behind.

You’ve been inundated with this topic everyday. The local news breaking into anything that had a national audience, your friends at work, the radio, your parents, Facebook. This “Jack O’ Lantern Slasher”, as some people have been calling him, has left every authority baffled. There has been no pattern to his killings, indiscriminate about sex, politics, social status, wealth, or even preferred sexual partners. In the past 3 weeks, this new killer has made Milton Ridge more famous than when there was an attempted military coup of the local political system back in 1975, when some White Supremacists attempted to form a “Whites Only government” to preserve the purity of the local populace. Thankfully, that lasted 3 minutes, when the gay lover of the group’s leader outed him. Everyone took to infighting, and then after a 1 minute brawl, the cops swarmed them and ended the affair.

There was some blood spilled at that uprising. But the Jack O’ Lantern Slasher has made that look like the stain of spilled grape juice by a five year old.

KPTV has been the worst about it, though. Every day, non-stop. Any opportunity they can get, they will shove a microphone in someone’s face. As the death toll mounts, more and more victims begin to emerge, mostly inadvertently with how Fox has been forcing their affiliate to put more screen time on the killings. But the more you are exposed to the body count, and the “public opinion”, the sicker you get with it each day. You just want it to stop, and for all of this to just go away. But with the numbers that tune in for the latest bit of information, you know that won’t happen for a long while.

Tonight was the worst of the media’s onslaught. Literally every channel you turned to had to deal with some aspect of death, or pain, or suffering. Every channel, tuned into Milton Ridge. Every viewer, forced to peer into your town and investigate every person that lives there. And you had the unfortunate response of threatening bodily harm on the report, demanding that you be left alone. You were neither victim, nor villain, and were not going to be portrayed as such. Too bad that the reporters cut into you during the 10:00 news broadcast. You turned off the TV, and angrily threw the remote across the room.

“DAMN IT!”, you screamed. “Those assholes invade my home, my privacy, and refuse to leave me alone, and yet I’M the one that deserves ridicule?! FUCK THEM!”

You turn your attention to the kitchen, and quickly shuffle to the fridge to grab a beer. You knew you were gonna have to do something. Slander, maybe? Defamation of character? You knew that you could probably get a settlement out of those bastards at the station. “And rightfully so!”, you think. You choose to put it out of your mind, and look out of the window by the sink in the kitchen.

Your home is small, but it’s yours. It rests on a half an acre, more than enough room for pretty much anything you could really want to do. It’s a good 10 minute drive to most areas in Milton Ridge, but a good distance away for your privacy. It’s cheap, which means you don’t have to scrape and save as much as most people you know, and utilities are rather cheap as well. The real reason you chose it, though, was the forests around the house. You recently decided you wanted to get a dog, and the woods would be perfect space for it to be happy. It’s solemn, but available, and more than enough to put you at ease. Well, as long as someone didn’t barge in and fuck up your day.

The light for the backyard drew your attention outside, and you realized that, angry as you are, it’s late, and that you needed to get some sleep. You were going to probably call a lawyer and press charges. So, you reach for the light switch, and deftly turn it off. As you proceed to pour the bottle into the sink, you reach over to turn off the kitchen light, too. Soon, you’re in darkness, and you rub your tired eyes. Sleep sounded like the perfect remedy to your day. You drop your hand, breathe in deeply, and then open your eyes.

Out in the woods, you could see them: two faint, white lights, deep in the woods outside the window. Whatever was out there was perfectly still, but within quick distance of your home. There is something… alluring about them. They seemed to dance, but refused to move. Whatever it was, it seemed like it was calling to you. It wanted your attention. It wanted YOU to come to it, for you to stare into it.

You quickly shake your head, and shove that thought out of your head. Somebody must have left something in a tree outside, and since it’s none of your concern, you throw the empty bottle away, and proceed to bed. You had to be ready for tomorrow. You were going to make sure that you weren’t made a joke.

As you make your way through the house, you turn off every light you come across. Ceiling fan lights above your couch? Off. Front porch lights? Darkened. The hallway light as you head to your room? On for the trek, and then off again. You even refuse to turn the lights on in your bedroom, choosing to change into your pajamas in the dark, instead of some more light that will antagonize the headache that’s been building in your head. You just want to get to sleep, and take care of your business tomorrow. But you know that your only really comfortable with some airflow in your room, so you turn to the window in your bedroom. You push aside the hanging curtains, and slide it open.

You close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The air is clean, and it begins to put your mind at ease, and you open your eyes again.

Deep in the woods are two white lights, this time stronger and brighter. They subtly dance, acting as a candle in the darkness. They burn in an attempt to entrance you. But this time, there’s a new detail: the outline of a man, darkened by the shadows of the woods, and standing perfectly still. You can’t tell what he looks like, but you know he stands transfixed on your home. You don’t know what he wants. Your home, valuables, or maybe you specifically, but you really don’t care. Those lights are calling to you. They want you. And they are near.

Your head begins to pound as the headache you were feeling begins to quickly transform into a migraine from Hell. So you shut the window, lock it, and close the curtains. No fucking lurker is gonna stop you from getting the rest you deserve. Your eyes grow tired, and you slip into sleep. Now is your time to experience eternity.

As you sleep, you find yourself in an empty room. You hover in that void, cold and absolute. You are unable to see anything, even your own hands in front of your face. You mold yourself into a ball, shivering and unable to fend off the feeling of abandonment. You know you serve no real purpose, except to live, to eat, to shit, and to die. You can feel no love, no hate, no emotion at all except fear and abandonment. Then off in the distance, you can spot a small light. A bright, white flame. So hot, it purifies that void you are surrounded by.

The more you stare at it, the larger it grows. And the larger it grows, the brighter it gets. But you can feel something from this flame: purpose. There’s an acceptance in its’ dance, and it calls out to you. “Embrace me. Take me into yourself. Make my heat your source of comfort and purpose. Give yourself to me, and allow me to use you as fuel for my purpose.” Its’ words eke out more and more of your sense of self, and you find your will slipping. You feel a heat in your hands, and you raise them in time to find yourself catching in flames. The same flames that now have you surrounded. You try to scream, but all air is sucked out of you. You grow blind with the bright light that now has you trapped.

Unable to breathe. Unable to cry. Unable to be yourself anymore. And you burn.

You wake with a start, sweating profusely. A dream of immolation. You close your eyes, and you try to bring your pulse down. You breathe in once, twice, and hold your breath, but your heart will not stop. And that’s when you can feel the cool air all around you. You think that your sweat from your nightmare has made you chilled, until you notice that the curtain by your bed has begun to flutter in the breeze, and a bright light shines from outside. A bright, white light that seems to make the shadows dance.

You spring from your bed, and rush to the window, flinging open the curtain, and stand transfixed by your view.

Outside your open window stands a priest, old and like stone. No emotions, no beliefs, nothing except the white fire from where his eyes are. He stands staring directly at you. Not, not at you. THROUGH YOU. You’re sure he can see something in you, but you’re not sure what or why. You just know that the fire within him has you entranced, and you cannot turn away.

The fire calls to you. “Give yourself to me. Serve a purpose, and give yourself to my flames.” You try and try, but you stare at the fire, unable to turn away. You can tell the priest has begun to move, as you feel his hand grab your arm, but you offer no resistance. The fire begins to grow brighter, as you feel a burst of heat from the priest’s hand. Intensity mounts, as the fire’s light matches the pain in your arm.

You begin to see visions of an ancient time. A Middle Eastern man strapped to a beam of wood, and another laughing at him, telling Him there would be no rest for Him. Darkened clouds, and an earthquake, and a torn cloth. A pillar of fire in front of the man, telling him that the man’s Father has cast judgement of eternal exile, helping others to find the rest that he will never get. To never find and comfort, and solace only once in any place that he might stay. Many dead people by his hand. A Samaritan passing that man, and offering him help. White fire jumping to the Samaritan, as that other man dies, and his eyes bursting into flames. Many dead people, over many centuries. Many different forms that the man has taken. Men at war, women at home, children in ascendance. Every one of them, taken over by white fire, and murdering those close to them.

You jump back to the priest, as the pain in your arm becomes unbearable. You see smoke begin to rise from his head, as his skin begins to blister and peel. And the intensity of the white flames grows ever brighter, BRIGHTER, BRIGHTER…

And that’s why you were on the floor. You cannot remember it, so I remembered it for you. You now serve MY purpose, young one. And your body shall burn when I am done using you to continue my Heavenly duty. No Man shall turn you down, and you shall be the instrument through which I will enact Heaven’s accord. So onward, Christian soldier. I cannot stay here anymore. We have more people to give their due reward.

(Transcript from breaking news on KPTV, Portland, Oregon’s Fox affiliate)

Local: It’s senseless. No one should die so horribly. Especially children…

Carl Stanton: Good morning, I’m Carl Stanton, and we’ve got some late breaking news. The Jack O’ Lantern Slasher, as many have been dubbing him, has struck again, officially propelling his numbers to over 100 last night in a brutal killing spree. Live in the field is Christine Winthropp with the latest information. Christine?

Christine Winthropp: Yes, Carl. I’m here on the outskirts of Milwaukee, where the Jack O’ Lantern Slasher made his last stop, before seemingly disappearing again. It seemed that the murders began in Milton Ridge just 5 miles away, but in what authorities deem to be about 2 hours, he made short work to outlying Milwaukee, where the Tahlmud family was the last batch of victims in his path.

Carl Stanton: And there has been word that the daughter of the Tahlmud family has apparently gone missing. Am I correct, Christine?

Christine Winthropp: Yes, that’s correct. 6 year old Lori Tahlmud has apparently gone missing from the house entirely. They’re not sure if the killer has abducted her or if she’s run away, but authorities are officially fearing the worst for her.

Carl Stanton: And there was a bit of evidence that alters the current investigation as well, Christine?

Christine Winthropp: That is correct, Carl. It seems that there was a cremated body in the middle of Lori’s bedroom. Given the size, it would appear to be the body of an adult human. But due to the thoroughness of the cremation, authorities are not sure of the gender or age of the supposed victim. Forensic experts are baffled to how the body could be burned so thoroughly in what they purport to be the span of a few minutes at most, and leave behind little to no evidence. Never the less, they will continue to sift through the remains, in hopes of finding the additional victim found in the Tahlmud’s home.

Carl Stanton: This is just an absolute nightmare for all of those involved. I pray that Lori Tahlmud is found safe and sound.

1365473871.0,25,self.creepypasta,1byo61,Strobes,GLKnight,34,9,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1byo61/strobes/,"    Loneliness is a crippling dilemma. Especially for an insomniac. Many years ago, when my brother was getting married, he told me how, during a long period of insomnia, he learned from a man a technique to find out the one being with whom he was meant to be with. We had some drinks with a few of our friends, and when everyone else had passed out in the middle of the night, he told me exactly what to do.

He said it should be done on the darkest night of the year, in the darkest, quietest room of a house. So maybe blacking out windows, and muffling noises might be in order. In order to prepare for the event, you have to have been awake for at least 4 or more days in a row, no sleep, no rest, almost no food. Rest yourself on a bed or a couch when you’re ready, and turn on a very soft, very weak source of light. Then stare at the ceiling. He said the ceiling was best because it was “the way all things look”, as he was taught.

As you stare at the ceiling, the light will slowly start to ripple, like a strobe. First, a vague outline takes shape, humanoid in appearance, but clearly present. Don’t blink or turn away, he said, for that prevents you from making things take shape. As the rippling effect picks up speed, the figure will become more detailed. By this point, your eyes should be starting to ache, but you have to resist the sensation until you complete filling in the details. Certain details like eyes, nose, mouth and ears should begin to take shape and color, as well as the type of build they would have. By this point, your eyes should be in serious pain, for you are breaking a semblance of time and space for this knowledge. DO NOT turn your eyes away or blink. Or it will be for naught.

Then, he said, the figure of the person before you will be able to see you. It’s not uncommon for it to reach out to you, to try and touch you. DO NOT DO THIS. If you do, you’re bridging your time and space with theirs, and by that point, you will vanish from reality altogether. Continue staring at the figure, until it looks exactly like a person is in the room with you. By this point, your eyes will be beyond the normal threshold, and will try to close themselves on you. RESIST DOING THIS, for you have one more thing to do. If you can resist, you will then be able to ask this form 3 questions.

Who are you?

Where will we meet?

When will we be together for all eternity?

Ask any other questions than these, and there will be a flash so bright, your sight will be taken, and a clap so loud, you shall no longer be able to hear a thing. And worst of all, this one chance at connection will be lost for all eternity. But if you are successful, the bridge shall be completed, and the figure shall slowly fade from above you. And you will be able to go on with your life, with the comfort of knowing your destined meeting.

But he also warned me about something else. The process only really works because of what lies in your heart. Lust, anger, greed, hatred, jealousy, or any other form of wickedness, and the effect will prove disastrous. “Love can only be truly attained with a pure heart,” he pleaded, “and any other desire outside of the pure will call something other than what you intended. If this does happen, then look away before it fully takes shape. If it takes form, then you will belong to it, and it can claim you. It’s for THAT REASON ALONE that I ask you to not do what I did.”

“I was lucky”, he said. “Very, VERY few are.”

Like I said, it’s been many years since he said that. My last girlfriend dumped my a year and a half ago, and the loneliness has been gnawing at me since then. So I’m going through with it. It took me a week or two to prepare, but I’m ready now. As I’m writing this, the bottle of Scotch to get me ready for this is almost empty, and if I fail, then I’m going to kill myself immediately afterwards. If I’m going to be alone, then I’m going OUT alone as well. No point in wasting time, huh?

Pray that I succeed. I’m… I’m just so SCARED of being alone.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1byo61,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1byo61/strobes/,

That feeling of seeing something barely in the corner of your eye, catching a glimpse of movement in the darkness. ''Must be my mind playing tricks!'' you think, and lull yourself into a false secuirity. As your heart calms and you return to your book, your video game, or just go to sleep, you hear a sudden sound. Almost like someone taking a careful step, making itself known, to see if you are still paying attention to it's presense. You turn your head, slowly or swift, it doesn't matter; you won't see anything there but the shadows. And that's all there ever was, the shadows. Watching, listening. They've been there always. Even as a child you felt them there. Just as you switched the light on, you could sense something passing by, retreating into the dark. You could almost see it. And some people can see them, staring back from the darkness. These people are insane, of course. Branded so by the society which is unwilling to admit the existance of such entities. 

I learned this when my grandfather was taken away for treatment. Every now and then, he calls me and asks if the shadows are still here. I tell him no. I deny their existance, as I can never tell anyone I see them aswell. But I do. I've seen them ever since my grandfather told me about them. I didn't believe him, but he pointed his finger to the far corner of the room, and as my eyes followed, a chill crawled down my spine. There stood a man. Barely visible, and yet I could not unsee him. He was looking at my grandfather, but turned his gaze to me before I could say a word. 

I leave you a word of warning: The picture below was taken at the same room where I saw them the first time. One of them is presented in the picture, so if you wish not to see them, close this page and don't return. Once you have seen one, they will be in the corner of your eye forever, untill you forget them. It seems the more you know about them, the easier they are to see, so if you do not wish this burden, forget everything I've told you.

You try to make a decision, and it pipes up again. It feels like a second person inside your head. I was 15 years old, out with my friends. Us younglings were being idiots like we all do when we’re young, and someone had convinced us to go bungee jumping. That's when it started.
I had all the gear on, safety harness and all. It was the 16th of May, on Insert Bridge and not the best day to go outside. Not cold or rainy, just eerie. The mist shrouded the mountains around the bridge. And there was the voice. Out of nowhere. “Go on, Tom. Jump. Go on.” It was faint, it was almost like it wasn’t me talking, some sort of being taking control.

“You’re so slow, Thomas. We’re waiting for you!” cried Andrew. “Stop your whining, Whingy.” “Shut up! Let’s just go, Joel.”


That’s when I spoke up. “Hey guys, I… Uhh… I might not do this.” There was the voice again. “What are you doing? You know you want to jump.” “Hey Tom!” I look around to Joel, he stares at me for a second blankly. “Nnnnnnnncluck! Cluck, cluck! Buq buq buq!” Andrew joined in. Their cruel cries tortured me, if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s being called weak. The voice started laughing. “Fine. Let’s go.”


I get into my harness and stand at the edge of Insert Bridge. “You go first, Tom. We want to see you fall” said Joel. The instructor steps up behind me. “3! 2! 1!” The voice starts to laugh. “Jump!” I fall off the bridge, and I hear a snap.

My vision was blurry and absolutely everything hurt. I could make out was that I was at the mouth of some sort of cavern or cave. I could see the river underneath Insert Bridge and it was absolutely pouring. I was soaked to the bone. I attempted to get up but was soon followed by a sharp, searing pain shooting up my right leg, starting from my ankle and ending at my knee. Something wasn’t right. I lay there for a while more, just thinking about what happened, I had completely forgotten about the voice. And there it was. It felt like something was watching me, something in my presence. I turned around and saw nothing, turned back around and a flicker at the corner of my eye.


By now I had established that there was something else here, whether it was an animal or a human, or neither, it was alive. I was immediately aware, my body rejected all the pain and pushed it away. My senses came back to life and I could feel everything. I tried to look around but my neck locked in place, the muscles denied the input from my brain. Everything around me turned cold and lifeless and I felt something coming up behind me. I began to lose consciousness but not from pain or injury, even though my injuries were great. It felt like everything was shifting away to the back of my mind, and something was taking over. It had replaced me. I could still hear everything. I could still acknowledge everything that happened to and around me. I just couldn't control my body. I didn't know what it was, it seemed dark and evil so I was too scared to try and communicate. My body rises, shaking and jittering and my face forms a grin. ""Tom! Tom!"" I could hear sirens. Flashing lights and everything around me was dark, penetrating my mind. ""You're alive! Guys, Tom's alive!"" Joel began to cry and smile at the exact same time. ""You stupid, STUPID kid! You had me worried sick! I, I thought you died!"" The crying had taken over. He came up to me, slammed his fists on my chest and proceeded to hug me with the force of a million bears. Mind you, I still hadn't said anything yet. In the midst of the happiness I was feeling, I forgot my fears of this being that had infected my mind and attempted to talk. What I thought came out of my mouth. ""Oh my God, Joel! I can't believe I'm still alive! The craziest thing happened! I fell in a cave and then there was this thing and the-"" I stopped. I wasn't speaking. By this time I was in the back of the ambulance with all the guys, the nurse had gone on and on about how I'm lucky to be alive.

A few moments later, my friends realised I'd stopped talking. Well, it wasn't exactly me, guess it was my body, but I had no way to tell them, but- Never mind. It took the nurses a while to diagnose what was wrong. At first they thought it was a coma but they realised that I was still reacting and moving, so they ruled that out. Apparently I'm mute from shock and unable to talk for a while. I'm not going to lie, I'm angry. This thing inside my head is still here, still there, still planted, and you know what? That's exactly what's going to happen. I think it's like a seed, and it will grow. I don't know what it will grow on, but it will. If I can figure that out, then I might be able to get rid of it.

The doctor treated all kinds of diseases of the body, and of the mind aswell. He was liked and respected, and people came to share all sorts of problems with him. One day, one of the people living in the village completely isolated himself, never leaving his house. The people of the village asked the doctor to try and find out what's wrong with the man. They talked to eachother for a while, and eventually the man came outside. The villagers were happy that the doctor had succeeded in helping the man, and no one noticed the pale look on the doctor's face while he walked back into his house.

Everything was normal for a few days. Then, something happened. The doctor was dead. The villagers had found him on the floor of his house, with eyes spread wide and an expression of pure horror on his face. There were no signs of struggle and his body was without injury. It was like his soul had been torn out of his body. Everyone was shocked, except one person. The one who knew this would happen. The villagers buried the doctor and closed off the house. But while they were carrying out his body, one of them found his diary. He had written all about his patients in that diary. On the last few pages, he had written about that man, the one who had isolated himself in his house. The villagers decided to read it at a ceremony, to let everyone hear the fine doctor's last thoughts. This is what was written:

*The man speaks of a curse, one that kills it's victim in a matter of days. There is only one way to get rid of it, he says. The curse bearer must pass on the curse by telling someone else  about it. If the curse isn't passed on, it will claim your soul and stop spreading. The man apologised, and opened his door. He was crying, but seemed relieved. He said that the curse is now after me. I must say, this gave me quite the fright, even though I don't believe in this sort of lunacy. I doubt the curse is real, but if it is, I'd rather take it with me to the grave than pass it on.*

The village was dead in four days, save for one survivor. The one that didn't attend the ceremony. The one who passed on the curse in the first place.

Ok. So. A few nights ago (I’m lazy and just now felt like posting this) I went to bed around 11:30 and watched a couple episodes of King of the Hill like I do every night. It got to be 3 in the morning before I decided I needed to get to sleep. I turned everything off and laid in bed for an hour or so before falling asleep. When I finally did, I didn’t even realize it. I started dreaming but the dream felt so realistic. Part of the reason why it felt so real was probably because I was still in bed in my dream. I was in my room with everything looking exactly the same. The bed sheets, the walls, the stuff on the floor, I was even wearing only my boxers like I do every night when I go to bed. My dream starts off with me just lying there while I hear my parents in living room talking. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but it slowly starts getting closer and closer. They get to my door still talking and come in, where I close my eyes and pretend to be asleep. As soon as they walk in, they stop all conversation, even though they were mid-sentence a second ago. They just start walking around the room not talking to each other. After a minute of this, my dad says something than walks out leaving only my mom in the room with me. I heard her say bye to him from behind me, but I can see a figure standing directly in front of me even though she did not move after saying bye. All signs of my mom are gone at this point and the figure stays right there staring at me. I’m too scared to open my eyes so I lie there, staying perfectly still. This goes on for a couple of minutes, no sound and no movement from either of us. Finally, I get so fed up with this thing standing there that I decide to open my eyers and see what it is. I open them and there’s nothing there, but my door’s wide open and I see something out of the corner of my eye. Lying on the floor at the head of my bed is what looks like my little brother, except he was completely bald. I could only see the top of his head poking out from the ground. At seeing him, I attempted to say “Matthew go to bed”, but I couldn’t speak. I kept trying to say that, but nothing was coming out no matter how hard I tried. I remember the feeling of being paralyzed in my dream. Like I said before, it felt so real that I honestly had no idea I was even dreaming. It felt almost like I was too tired to say anything. My body was just so drained of energy that I couldn’t even make out that simple sentence. I tried to move just to see if I could but nothing happened. I was totally paralyzed. Matthew suddenly started giggling and wiggling around on the ground. I laid there trying as hard as I could to say something but still nothing. Matthew started laughing harder and harder, almost as if he was laughing at me trying to do anything. After what felt like forever trying to say anything, I finally manage to mumble out something that somewhat resembled “Matthew go to bed”. Matthew stopped laughing from the floor. Everything became dead silent and I said it again, this time a little clearer “Matthew go to bed”. A few seconds went by, and nothing. I could still see the top of his head though, so I tried as hard as I could to push my pillow out from under me so it would hit him and he would leave. Once again, this simple task took what felt like forever to do and when I finally struggled enough to get it out from under me, it fell off onto his legs. He was still silent, but he stood up and punched me in the head and went back to the floor. I laid there thinking “what the fuck Matthew?!?”, but I still couldn’t move to do anything. I started reaching my hand out for something, I don’t remember what, but when I finally managed to get my hand up a bit, I woke up. My hand was still mid air in the exact same position it was in my dream. I immediately sat up and looked at the spot where Matthew was in my room but there was nothing. Everything was exactly the same as in my dream except my door was closed.

*Now here comes the weird part.*

I woke up the next morning and talked to my mom about my dream. Turns out she was up around the time I fell asleep. She came into my room to check on me, but my dad wasn’t with her when she did. Not only was she up, but she told me that Matthew was actually sleep walking that night. She found him in the kitchen getting a drink and he was totally asleep. In addition to this, the day before she gave him a really short haircut. I didn’t see it though because I was at work almost all that day and he was asleep when I came home so I never even knew that he had a haircut.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1337611980.0,,,True,t3_tx63m,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/tx63m/this_may_not_technically_be_creepy_pasta_but_this/,

Here's the story of the Copycat.",Philopilo,35,12,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1juona/im_not_really_a_believer_buti_wasnt_the_only_one/,"My Junior year of college, I was living in a frat house.  It's a smaller college in a small town and the people who join Greek Life tend to just be the ones who want to have any kind of social life with a few fratty douches mixed in.  
My room mate, Tony, was not one of the aforementioned, he was cool and kind of nerdy, spent a lot of time just sitting on his bed with his laptop and cracking jokes.  
Anyway, one night in the middle of the week I was in the library until one in the morning.  When I walked back to the house I cleaned up, walked down the hallway and into my room where I promptly jumped face-first into my bed.  
The rooms are just large enough to have a small carpet and two beds on either side of the room.  Oddly enough my room mate was sitting up on his bed just like he would if he was on his computer, only he was just sitting there like he was pretending to surf the net.  Jokingly with my head in the pillow I said ""Tony it's a school night, get to bed.""  He didn't respond.  I waited for him to throw something or make some snarky remark...but the only thing I heard out of the dark on his side was him starting to quietly snore from his pillow.  Whatever it was that was sitting on Tony's bed was still there, just...sitting.  The worst part was that I could feel it watch me from his bed, so I looked up and tried to get a good picture of the creature.  We watched each other for a few seconds, then it stood up and for lack of a better description melted through the floor.
I fell asleep that night, eventually, after I convinced myself that sleep deprivation and a night of business law had me hallucinating.  I mean I had never seen much proof of the supernatural anyways, so convincing myself wasn't so hard.  
I woke up the next morning and looked over to Tony's bed to see him sitting up on his computer.  Laughing to myself about how stupid last night had been I jokingly said ""You should probably move, there was a ghost there last night.""
He laughed back and said ""how would you know, you were asleep before I was.""
I stopped laughing and told him I got in at one in the morning and he was sleeping soundly, which is when he told me that when he came back to a dark room where I was meditating on my bed at 11.  He tried talking to me and when I wouldn't respond, so he figured I had fallen asleep sitting up and he just went to bed.  The copycat had been in my room all night.
Terrified and intrigued I found the room's old inhabitants, one was my pledge brother so it wasn't hard to find him, and I asked if he had noticed anything odd while living there.  The only thing he could say was that his room mate had drunkenly walked in one weekend and punched a hole in the wall, saying he thought he had seen someone.
The house had been built in 1994 and I would have known if someone had died in the house, no one was tortured there, so I was stumped.  We were fine for a few weeks, then I saw the Copycat again, standing by his closet the same night he saw it sitting on my bed again.  This continued on and off throughout the semester, sometimes only one of us would see the Copycat and sometimes both of us would.  
This continued until the night Tony and I stole our friends Batman mask and hung it up on the wall by our door.  That night Tony reported seeing the Copycat staring at the mask like it was angry that we would put it there.  I found it on the ground the next morning several feet away from where it was hung like something had knocked it away.  The next night I walked into the room at two in the morning to see the Copycat standing over Tony's bed staring at him while he slept. That was when I learned what my room mate meant when he said it seemed angry.  The black outline of the Copycat was more solid, bigger than usual and shorter.  It was craned over Tony and you could feel the seething anger coming from the Copycat and most disturbing it was rocking back and forth like it was ready for something to happen, waiting.  I slept elsewhere that night.
A month or so later things had calmed down some, Tony showed no signs of demonic possession and the Copycat had stopped coming around to my knowledge.  But during finals I had to stay up extra late, the 1:00 nights were more like 3:00 now and Tony was doing something of the same.  That Thursday I walked into my dark room and crawled into bed, lay my head down.  Just as I was closing my eyes I heard a breath drawn inches away from my face and a woman's voice whispered my name in my ear.  I shot up just in time to see the Copycat walking into my closet.  
That was the last I have seen of her, to this day I don't know why she was watching us what she wanted or even the real name for this thing.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1juona,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1juona/im_not_really_a_believer_buti_wasnt_the_only_one/,

My great-great grandfather was devastated beyond belief, as she was his one true love and they had been married over 50 years. They were married so long it seemed as if they knew each other's innermost thoughts.

After the doctor pronounced her dead, my great-great grandfather insisted that she was not. They had to literally pry him away from his wife's body so they could ready her for burial.

Now, back in those days they had backyard burial plots and did not drain the body of its fluids. They simply prepared a proper coffin and committed the body (in its coffin) to its permanent resting place. Throughout this process, my great-great grandfather protested so fiercely that he had to be sedated and put to bed. His wife was buried and that was that.

That night he woke to a horrific vision of his wife hysterically trying to scratch her way out of the coffin. He phoned the doctor immediately and begged to have his wife's body exhumed. The doctor refused, but my great-great grandfather had this nightmare every night for a week, each time frantically begging to have his wife removed from the grave.

Finally the doctor gave in and, together with local authorities, exhumed the body.

My wife and I knew it was an important birthday. Next year our little Mikey will go to school, so this is sort of an end of an era, however short. After a lot of debating we decided on a clown for the entertainment. I was against it.

I was one of the many people who were afraid of clown. As a kid I trembled, shook and started hyper-ventilating at the site of one on television. But our son was not. Ever since Laura bought him some sort of computer game starring a clown he loved them. As a father I knew I had to do what make my little boy the happiest. And if that meant ordering a clown I would order a clown. Besides, I’m a grown-up they don’t scare me anymore. Or so I hoped.

The kids were playing in the yard, stuffing their face with cake and snacks and enjoying the world in the innocent way only kids can. Laura and I waited for the clown in the living room. He was already 30 minutes late. But you can’t expect clown to be punctual. Finally he arrived, carrying a large pink bag.

He introduced himself as “Bonko” and sat on our couch. He really was your classic clown. White make-up, colorful puffy costume, big shoes, big red nose, an orange wig, the works. Laura asked if she can bring him anything. He declined. He sat in our living room for something like 15 minutes, smoking and tapping his shoe on the floor. He seemed nervous and I could swear I could see him drinking out of a flask. “Is this your first time?” I asked. He chuckled and without looking at me, said “It always is…”. I did not understand what he meant.

After finishing his smoke he put on a happy clown grin, grabbed his bag, and stood up. He gave me a tap on the back. I thought maybe he sensed my childhood fear, and tried to relax me.

Bonko went outside and started the show. He juggled, told jokes, sprayed water around, did some classic slapstick. Even I had to admit he was good. And the kids were just entranced.

“And now for the big finish” he declared. He took out three colorful boxes from his bag. They looked like birthday presents. “Pick one, birthday boy!”.

Mikey thought to himself. He looked so cute, like he was pretending to be an adult. Laura snapped a picture. He finally picked the middle one. Bonko sighed and grabbed it.

“Oh boy! Good choice!” He said in a cartoony voice. Though I swore I could hear some sadness in there. Bonko opened the box and took out a knife.

Laura and I were shocked, and before we could do anything. Bonko started cutting his own face. Bits of make-up covered skin fell to the ground, the children were screaming. Our little Mikey was covered in the clown’s blood and crying. I ran to stop Bonko but he collapsed to the ground. The paramedics declared him dead.

I looked inside the other boxes. In one was a small rifle and in the other a can of lighter fluid and a box of matches.


All the kids, including our little Mikey, had to go to therapy. We told the police, and they just looked to the floor ignoring us. I decided I can’t let this blow over. I tracked down the company that sent the clown.

It was in a small two story building. I expected a run down, scary old place but it was quite neat and modern. I marched to the manager’s office not letting anyone stop me.

I looked around. In his office were blown-up pictures of clowns with their faces cut off, heads cut off, bullet holes in their foreheads, faces burnet off, it was terrible. And every picture had poor, young children crying.
The manager was a skinny man in a tie. He looked to be in his late 40′s and had big bulging eyes. “Why do you this?” I yelled. He didn’t answer, just laughed in my face. Two big guys came from behind me and dragged me out.

“I will find someone who will make you pay! I will not be silent!”. He smiled at me and motioned his goons to hold me in place. “Do you love your family?” he asked. “Of course” I said “That’s why I’m here!”. ” “You made a mistake, sir” he said “Enjoy the rest of your life”.
It has been 43 days since then. I am still very afraid.

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g8aqz/menagerie_part_2/)

The Captain and the Flight Attendant make their way down a dark stairwell to the ground floor.  They rush to the front desk.  Nobody is there.  The staff has vanished.  She slaps on a service bell repeatedly.

“Hello??”

“Who was the guy who checked us in earlier?  I can’t even remember what he looked like.”

“Somebody, help!  Who’s running this hotel??”

The Captain jumps the desk and roots through drawers.  Finds a flashlight.  Grabs a stack of key cards.

● ● ●

The Mother tears through the dark hotel halls, floor by floor.  The Businessman at her heels.  Both of them calling out her Daughter’s name.

They suddenly arrive at a floor where all the lights are on.  They squint as their eyes adjust to the light.  This floor is clearly undergoing some renovation...

Long hallways stretch out before them, faded blue carpeting torn up in patches to reveal dirty metal grates.  Floral-patterned wallpaper peels down to reveal rust-covered metal walls.  A thin skin of paper, paint and carpeting seems to separate this entire hotel from a stark raving house of horrors.

The door to every room on this floor is wide open.

They burst into room after room.  Each one nearly identical.  Each one completely vacant.  No signs of life.
Out of nowhere, the faint sound of children’s laughter echoes through the halls.  Is it actual laughter or does it just sound like that?  There is something about it that seems artificial when you listen carefully.

They exit a room and find a maid standing down the hallway with a cleaning cart.  The stocky maid’s face is obscured in shadow.  She seems to stare at them through the cover of mop handles.  Stock-still.

The Mother and the Businessman look back at her.  Uncertain.

The Mother calls out, “Hello...?”

The maid does not move.  Does not respond.

The Businessman takes a step toward her.  “Excuse me, we’re looking for a—“

The maid suddenly starts pushing her cart toward them.  Moving faster and faster as she advances.  A sense of determination in her movement.  She pulls a steel tool out of the cart that resembles a cross between a butcher cleaver and a corkscrew.

The Mother and the Businessman duck into another room and slam the door.

In the room, the Businessman wedges a chair against the door handle.  The handle twists frantically as the maid tries to enter, ramming her stocky frame against the door.  The Businessman reaches into his jacket – pulls out a gun.

The maid abruptly stops banging on the door.

The Mother looks at his pistol.  “Why do you have a gun...?”

The Businessman is at a loss.  “I...”

She starts to back away from him.  “Thought you said you were a businessman.”

He approaches her.  “I am...  I-I just keep this for protection--”

“Don’t come near me.”

She suddenly notices there’s a small figure lying in the bed here, covered in sheets...

● ● ●

The Captain and the Flight Attendant make their way through the darkness of the second floor with the flashlight.  A hotel staff member quietly stalks them from a distance, cropped slightly by the edges of surveillance camera frames; his uniform indicates that he works at the front desk.  He slouches through the shadows with an awkward gait.

The Captain starts opening doors with key cards.

Empty rooms.

Empty bathrooms.

Empty closets.

Every so often, they nearly catch sight of the front desk clerk who pursues them, but he always manages to stay just outside their field of light.

They turn a corner in a hall and see someone standing at the far end.

It’s the Younger Flight Attendant.  Facing away from them.  Just standing there, in the middle of the hallway, in a bathrobe.  She seems to be dripping wet.  It’s not from the shower.

● ● ●

“Becky...?”

The Mother rips the sheet from the bed...

... revealing an old, wooden mannequin.  Its arms torn off.

She picks up the mannequin and throws it against the wall.  “What’s going on here?!”

The Businessman approaches her, gun still in his hand.

She turns on him:  “I told you, Don’t come near me.”

The Businessman slips the gun back into his jacket.  “Listen, occasionally, I have to work in situations where--”

“I don’t want to hear it.  I’m not in the habit of accepting drinks from strange men who carry concealed weapons.”

“Would you rather be with someone who was unarmed right now?  You have to trust me.”

“I don’t have to do anything except find my daughter and leave.”

The Mother looks around the room.  Checks under the bed.  Opens up the closet.  Runs into the bathroom and pulls aside the opaque shower curtain.

There’s no one here.

She leans against the sink.

The surveillance camera behind the mirror zooms in on her face as she goes through a range of emotions.  Panic.  Frustration.  Anger.  Fear.  The camera adjusts and makes a whirring sound which she seems to notice.

She stares through the mirror, directly into the camera.  She sees it.

She picks up a plunger and bashes the wooden handle against the mirror.  The mirror cracks.  Shatters.  The camera zooms out to a fixed wide-shot.  She reaches forward and takes the surveillance camera in her hands, looking straight into the lens.

“I want my daughter back, do you hear me??”

She yanks the camera out – the feed goes black.

● ● ●

In the darkness, the Older Flight Attendant approaches the figure of the Younger... quickly at first and then with more caution as she gets a better view.

The Younger stands there with her back turned, swaying lightly on her feet as if she were in a trance.  She is covered in a liquid that is slightly viscous.

The Captain calls out from a distance: “Don’t touch her...”

The Older ignores this and turns the Younger toward her.  Her eyes are wide open, pupils dilated.  She whispers something indecipherable before she collapses into the Older Flight Attendant’s arms.  Davis runs to them.

“What is she covered with?”  He checks her vitals.  She seems to be normal.

All the lights on the floor suddenly blink on, along with all the televisions in the rooms.  A distorted cacophony of different channels blares out at full volume from every open door.

● ● ●

The Mother combs through the bedroom, searching out all the hidden surveillance cameras and breaking them.  The Businessman looks at her curiously.

“What are you doing?”

“They’re watching us.  They’ve got cameras planted all over this place.”

“Who are ‘they’?”

“Whoever they are, whatever they are, they want us to panic.  They’re toying with us.  Conducting some twisted psychological experiment.  I think they want us to put on a show.  I’m taking their show off the air!”

As soon as she destroys a camera, another hidden surveillance camera blinks on and whirs to focus from another hidden perspective until our view of the room is completely turned around.

The final camera frames a clearer view of the locked door.  Before she can destroy the camera, the chair falls away from the door and the door clicks lightly open...

The Businessman draws his gun.  They both tentatively step out into the hallway.

It’s empty.  No sign of the maid.

Somewhere further down the hall, the Daughter’s voice calls: “Mom...”

● ● ●

The Captain and the Older carry the Younger out of the elevator and through the ground floor lobby.  Lights and electricity have returned but the place is still deserted.

“We’ll get her checked out at a hospital,” he says.

“We should try the landlines again, maybe they’re working now.”

“We just need to get out of here...”

● ● ●

The Mother and the Businessman head down the stairwell, following the sound of the Daughter’s voice calling her, “Mom...”  There is something slightly off about it.  Like the children’s laughter earlier.  Something synthetic.

“Becky?  We’re coming for you, sweetie, where are you...?”

Further down the stairwell, we see another hotel staff member descending the steps.  His uniform indicates a hotel manager.  We get a clearer look at his face: it is slightly misshapen, like a crooked mask.  Nothing that would raise alarms at first glance.  Something that seems more wrong the longer and closer you look at it.  He calls out with the Daughter’s voice, “Mom...,” luring them further down...

It was my first ever creepypasta but it was linked to from some random website. I wanted to show it to my little bro today but I can't for the life of me remember what is was called or any of the characters' names! All I can remember is the general storyline:
Basically there are two friends and one of them finds a bag of videos in his cellar/basement and they watch the vids together- the videos have no talking and are just of some guy watching people from bushes etc, and of him killing small animals or something equally weird and unsettling like that. They try and find out who this guy is- two old women are involved. The two friends visit these old women to see if they knew who the guy was and they women lie. The friends find out they were lying and find out the video guy used to live with the old women. Some more stuff happens and I think someone dies? (Not sure, maybe a dog?) Then one of the friends is like, ""we shouldn't look for this guy anymore because that's what he wants us to do""- so he goes back to his house, then comes back to visit his friend and it turns out his friend has become obsessed with this video weirdo guy and has gone a bit mental. At some point it's found out that the video guy was living in the obsessed friend's shed. I think the shed is then burned down? Not sure... I think the moral of the story was that this video guy spreads his evil weirdness by people watching his videos and talking about him- the more you talk about him, the more likely he is to come visit you.

If anyone knows what this story is, please share! It's killing me slowly!! Any help is muchos appreciated :P xxxxxx",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_16hyts,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16hyts/help_with_finding_the_first_creepypasta_i_ever/,

He lived a few blocks away, and there weren’t many streetlights in our neighborhood. It was dark, but I had my flashlight out, and it was lighting my way. 

After a few minutes of walking, I passed an abandoned lot where there were only woods. I shined my flashlight into the woods, and saw a dark figure move in the distance. Being a smart person who isn’t in a horror film, I decided to keep walking home and not investigate. 

I shrugged off the figure as just a cat, and made it home safely. Or so I thought. 

A few hours later, I was getting ready for bed. I closed my blinds, and took a peek outside. A similar figure appeared in the distance, and I decided that I needed to go to sleep. 

Hours later, I was in a deep sleep. I had a dream where I woke up and took a walk outside to find the figure I encountered earlier. 

I walked down by the woods, and decided to start looking there. I took out my flashlight, and began searching. 

I looked for what seemed like hours, and finally found the figure.

A man-like figure, standing in the distance. It was facing away from me. The figure was very tall, and appeared to be wearing a suit. 

I yelled out: Hello?

My mistake. 

The figure slowly turned around, and I noticed there was no face. It noticed me, and I got a very strong headache when I felt it look at me. 

I woke up the next morning back in my bed, and noticed that I was fully clothed. I examined my flashlight, and noticed that the batteries were dead. It must have been on all night. I swapped out the batteries with new ones, and continued on with my day.

That night, I had a very similar dream. I went back to the woods, and saw the figure again. But this time, I didn’t say anything. I quietly turned around, and began to go back home. I felt that something was following me.

I was right.

I turned around and saw the figure in the distance. My pace quickened, and I started to run. It seemed like everytime I turned around, the figure was always right behind me. 
By the time I got home, I was exhausted. I jumped into bed, and immediately woke up.

It was night time. I wasn’t in my bed.

I was at the entrance to the woods. I reached into my pocket, and got out my flashlight. I turned it on, and scanned the area. No sign of the figure. Good. I carefully started to walk home. As I was about to open the door to my house, I turned around one last time. There was nothing there. I breathed a sigh of relief. I opened the door, and got inside. I thought I was safe. 

I was wrong. 

I sensed that something wasn’t right. I walked down the hallway into my bedroom, and jumped into bed. As I began to close my eyes, I saw the figure. 

It was in my room. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_123jy8,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/123jy8/a_trip_to_the_woods_and_back/,

Yes, I had this dream many times. Also sorry for my bad english as it is not my main language. Also the story has been changed a little bit to fit the needs of a story.

It was a hot summer day, I was driving with my one friend and his parents. We stopped in the middle of the country right outside of a house made mostly of wood. 
""We are here"" Said Conner's mom.
""Can't wait"" I mumbled on the fact that my parents have forced me to go with them. We take a step inside the house taking a look around. Two floors with a kitchen, a bathroom, 3 bedrooms, No basement, and long hallways leading to each room. 

Skip ahead one week, Our day was like this: Get up, Eat, Explore the forest nearby, eat, sleep. Not exactly the ideal summer spent but it was okay with me since my life was dull as is. The worst part though was for some reason each night. Conner would wake me up because of the bone chilling cold there was each night.

This stayed the same way another week until I got woken up again. But not by Conner, it was by the cold that was a lot worse than any other night. I check over to see Conner surprised he didn't wake me up from the cold, He wasn't there.

I walked downstairs into the kitchen to see Conner warming himself near the heater.
""Feeling cold"" I blurted out
""Screw off""
""I can't believe you didn't wake me up"" I said back
""How about you stop being a dick and go to bed?"" He said back with a small yell.
""Whats your problem?"" I asked
Before saying anything else he came up to me and held me by my shirt. But before he could say anything else the floorboards beneath us gave away into a hole about 5 feet wide and 4 feet in length that had a lot of smooth curves, the pit also curved to the right where you couldn't see from the top. The most startling part was that the pit walls. They were made out of icy snow. 

I fell down about ten feet while Conner fell about three, we both caught our footing on the big curves of the pit. He climbed out of the pit leaving me staring down at the dark endless bottom. He stared at me at the top shocked and then I screamed out
""Help me out of here!""
""Why should I?"" He said back with a smile.
""What?! Why would you want to leave me here?"" I said back.

Conner didn't say anything back, He covered the pit with a rug and than I'm guessing went back to bed. I wanted to scream, But I couldn't because Conner could easily throw a object down here making me fall. I have no idea what is wrong with Conner. 

The next morning I hear his father coming towards the kitchen in a kind of ""Just woke up"" Walk I picked up from my own father. I then heard him making coffee, I than heard Conner asking him to come here so he started taking a few steps. But he got no further because the rug gave away under him. 

Having hot coffee splashed in my face distorted the image, But what I think I saw was his father in his morning robe falling down. Breaking his neck off of a large bump in the wall just 4 feet beneath where I was clinging onto the corner. I hear Conner walk away laughing, why would he get us both killed. But I remember I am still alive but just a small thread away from death.

What I believe is half an hour later I hear Conner stepping into the kitchen. I see him walk across the edge of the pit holding a small metal crowbar. After standing on the other side where I can't see I hear him call out for his mom. Shortly after his mom arrives asking what he wants. Conner says nothing. 
""What is this hole?!"" She asks right before looking over the pit

Conner's mom gasps after seeing me there, Conner swings with his crowbar right above her head. She falls into the pit. Forcing me a few more feet into the pit. 

Goodbye Conner says to his mother.
""You are sick! Why would you do this?""
""Because I don't want to live like how I am, I would much rather be a murder than a guy living how I was. His words make me pity him, A lot. But I remember how sick and twisted that was. 

The next thing I remember is him throwing down a chair making me fall. As I start falling, I remember my past. My mother being by my side since the day my father died. All the bad and good times I had. And, The time. My father gave me a pocket knife. I never let go of it. 

I come back to reality and whip out the pocket knife and stab the wall. It stick in and catches my fall, by this time Conner has walked away. I slowly use the knife to climb back up by stabbing the wall, going up, then stabbing again. 

I finally reach the top of the pit, I climb out to see Conner running at me with the crowbar. I duck out of his way and stab him in the back. He falls steeply into the pit but catches onto the edge.
""Pull me out!"" He yells with pain at me.
I reach out my hand, and so does he. I stomp on his other hand and tug out the knife from his back. Throwing him down the pit. Then endless. Dark pit. Made of snow and ice in the middle of summer. Endless. Pit. I think that it would be better than killing him up here. Because even though he killed them, he still should die with his parents.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_x0xjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/x0xjv/the_hole_in_the_ground/,

The one about some bridge or some location, usually in a valley and almost always near water, where something horrible supposedly happened to a mother and her baby, and at night if you are quiet you can hear a baby crying or a woman calling for her child? Yeah, that one. It’s a great excuse to take your girlfriend out to a dark secluded location, get her all scared and have her jump in your lap. When she feels all safe and secure, the panties come right off, right? Scary places always landed me the choice ass back in the day. Know what I mean bro?
Yeah well, I know what really happened, and I know the place where it occurred. You see, there’s this old bridge down in a valley that crosses a small river. It’s not far from here, If you want I can take you out there. Yeah, we can go tonight.
The legend usually says a mother was rushing her sick baby to the hospital and ran her car off the bridge. The story also goes that the mother got out of the car, but drowned after repeatedly trying to find her baby in the dark water. The next morning the police found the car and the two bodies after a farmer called the wreck in. Years later teenagers used to hang out in the fields on the north side of the bridge, and they told stories of hearing a woman screaming “Oh god MY BABY SOMEONE PLEASE HELP OH GOD MY BABY”. There are variations, but this is usually the gist of the tale. Well, the truth is, the valley was haunted a long time before anything like that ever happened, and it wasn’t haunted by some woman screaming for her lost baby. Not then at least.
You see, out in the country here, there’s things that never see the light of day. Things not meant for mortal eyes. They wander the countryside looking for food. They feed on humans you see. They wear the skin of their kills, look just like us. Once it’s on them you can’t tell them apart from us. What they look like under the skin, nobody alive now knows.
The woman in the story, she WAS rushing her baby to the hospital, and she did wreck, but she didn’t run off the bridge. She came close though, and she seemed to be in luck, as a truck came along just minutes after she ran off the road and smacked a tree. Her lights were still on, and the driver of the truck spotted her waving in the middle of the road. What happens next, well… it’s pretty horrible. You see the driver of the truck, well, he was one of those things, and he was wearing the previous owner’s skin. He pulls over, offers to help. The mother is on the verge of passin’ out, so he helps her get the baby out of the car. He found it impossible to resist the tender, sweet flesh of one so young. The smell of it’s innocence was too much, and its appetite overtook it. He ate the baby right there in front of the mother. Jaws split like some sort of horrible giant snake, bit it right in half, swallowed it in two bites. Right in front of that poor woman. That’s where the screams come from you see. Right before he ate her too. Of course, she didn’t die so quick, being a much bigger meal than a little baby.
The real horror of these things is, once they eat you, your soul or whatever, it doesn’t move on like it does after a normal death. It lingers, you see. How do I know all of this? Well, I grew up around here. My grandfather told me all about it. He was one of the cops that found the car, you see. He ran across one of those things here in town once. Said it looked like a person, just didn’t seem to move right. His grandmother was an old Indian wise woman, she told him stories of the skinwalkers when he was a child. Said he’d know when he met one.
So you want to see the place? It’s just a few miles from here. Yeah, hop in the truck, I’ll take you out there. She’s a beaut ain’t she? Belonged to my grandpa too, she’s a 55 Chevy. Restored it myself. Finish your drink, we’ll head out there.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_vt7f4,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vt7f4/you_know_that_old_urban_legend/,

Parents gone, running the house, doing whatever you want. I thought so. That's why I was so excited when my parents told me they'd be spending the night away and I'd get to stay alone in the house. Now, my parents are pretty strict, and this is the first time that I've been allowed to do this, so I was pretty psyched. They left this afternoon, and from the moment I saw the car disappear past the curve in the road, I knew I was home free. I did the regular stuff: Pumped up the music, made a tv dinner, and sat down to play video games for awhile. I lost track of time, and the next time my eyes left the screen, it was around midnight. The only reason I'd been distracted was that the dog was barking. She obviously needed to go out, and, being the only person home, the duty fell on me. Grudgingly, I put on my shoes and leashed her up. As I stepped into the crisp air, I shivered involuntarily. It was partly because of the cold, and partially, something...else. The moon was full, shining coldly through its coat of clouds, and it illuminated my path well. As I walked toward the patch of trees where the dog does her business, I got a strange feeling. Cliche, right? I shrugged it off, blaming it on too many video games and not enough sleep. Boy, was I wrong. As my eyes wandered around the yard, I suddenly caught sight of something. Across the yard, about 50 feet away, there was someone standing, stock still, in the middle of the road. I froze. This wasn't like when you think you see something out of the corner of your eye, and when you look closely, it's gone. He was there. I know that now. After a few seconds, he was gone. No flash of smoke, no sound at all, he was just there one moment, and the next, he was gone. I stood where I was, unable to move, trying desperately to tell myself that I'd hallucinated that. After awhile, I stumbled inside and locked the door. It was just a neighbor, out for a walk. It had to be. Or maybe it wasn't real at all! Maybe it was just my imagination, fueled on soda and violent games. It had to be. I had to believe it was that, and not something else. After double-checking that all of the doors were locked, I sat down to resume my game. The adrenaline had left my body, and I was starting to believe myself and calm down. It was just nerves and excitement from being alone for the first time. Alone. At that point, I was calmed down sufficiently and back into my game. I laughed at myself for being such a wimp and being scared by something that wasn't there. I actually laughed out loud. As the night progressed, I made real progress in my game. But another thing happened. I started hearing things. A scratch that sounded like it was coming from the downstairs door. A thud that sounded like it was coming from the stairs. A faint hiss...

Now I'm in an upstairs closet. The sounds are getting closer, and I'm scared out of my mind. I think it's reached the top of the stairs. How could I have been so foolish? I can hear it outside in the hall. I can't believe I brushed off what I had seen. The doorknob is turning, I can hear it creak. How could I have thought that I was alone? I am most certainly not alone anymore.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_tf8gw,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/tf8gw/home_alone/,

James said as he took the the keycard from the receptionist. *She's young, 22...23* he thought to himself as his eyes again drifted down to the tiny glimpse of her bra that was peaking out from her blouse every time she leaned across the countertop. He looked up at her face just as her eyes moved up to meet his, narrowly averting being caught. 

""Just let us know if you need anything. Sorry we didn't have anything available up front, we're hardly ever this full."" She said with a polite smile, before turning away towards her computer. 

James lingered for moment, his eyes taking in her figure in a well fitting skirt that complimented her blouse. *Classy as shit for a Ranala Inn* he thought to himself as he turned and exited the lobby area to his car. James had been driving from San Diego to Nashville. Somewhere past Vegas he had hit a wall and decided to shut it down for the night. Luckily he had found a decent looking roadside motel just a few miles from where he caught himself nodding off behind the wheel. It was an older style, single floor motel, but the outside looked clean, and the lobby and check in staff in particular, appealed to him on some level he couldn't put his finger on. James got into his truck and pulled around to the rear of the building where she had told him that he could find his room. A variety of cars with a larger selection of state license plates sat quietly along the building. He found a spot several doors down from 60 and pulled in. 

After the satisfying beep and the flashing green light lit up on the keypad, he pushed open the door and stood for a moment. A powerful smell of rotten meat and sour bile nearly doubled him over. He blew out the initial breath and instinctly covered his mouth and nose. 

""WHAT THE FU..."" he started to say loudly as he took another breath in. Nothing. No smell offended his senses. He breathed in through his nose cautiously at first. A slight smell of musty curtains and generous amounts of lemon cleaner were all he could detect. He moved around the room carefully, peeking behind the bed, into the bathroom, behind the tv, sniffing as he went, nothing. *that's some weird shit right there*.

James pulled his luggage from the doorway into room and tossed it onto the corner of the bed. He turned the television on and flipped through several channels, settling on an HBO movie. He walked into the bathroom and relieved himself, he had been holding a piss for the last hour. He turned on the faucet and began washing his hands. The bathroom was angled so that he could see a sliver of the room behind him. He saw a slight movement and heard and watched as his suitcase slid off the corner of the bed on thumped onto the floor. He walked out and looked over the room. The security bar was firmly in place. James walked over to the bed and leaned down, pulling the comforter up and looking underneath. It was an old fashioned bed, one without the box underneath to prevent items from being stored or pushed underneath. The carpet underneath was mostly clean, with only a few specks of lint underneath. Up near the head James saw a larger white object that looked somewhat shiny, but it was far enough back that it wasn't worth the effort to try and fish it out. James walked over and lifted his suitcase on top of the dresser next to the TV. He stripped off his shirt and pants, kicked his shoes next to the bed, and fell into the mattress face first. He halfheartedly watched TV for a few minutes, before sliding around underneath the sheet and blanket. He reached over and flicked the switch next to the bed, plunging the room into darkness. He closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of trucks passing by on the nearby interstate. James had almost drifted off to sleep when he heard a slight sucking noise in the room. Immediately he snapped awake and reached for the switch to turn the lamp back on. He felt the lower sheet cling to his arm and shoulder for a brief moment. He looked around the room and saw nothing. *dude's getting sucked off next door or something*

He snapped the lamp back off and laid back down. Several quiet minutes passed and he was drifting back off to sleep when he realized that he felt warm. *Warm but not hot* He mentally struggled with staying conscious and evaluating his current comfort. His back started to feel warmer and warmer, but not painful. He shifted and felt his back slick with sweat, but it didn't feel like he was hot enough to sweat. Just warm and numb. By sheer force of will he managed to roll one eyelid open. The room was bathed in a soft orange light the creeped in around the window drapes from the parking lot light. He rolled his head to the left and felt the same warming numbness creep onto his ear and his face. He looked at the reflection on the now dark television screen. He could see the covers and the mattress shifting and bulging all around him. He felt a twinge of panic that seemed to fade away in the numbness that filled his entire body now. Lazily he lifted his left arm in front of his face. He saw the dark smears on the sheets and saw globs of his dissolving flesh dripping down from the bone of his upper arm. *so warm* he thought to himself and he lowered his arm and fell asleep. 

Rosa opened the door to Room 60. Standing outside for just a moment to let the festering meat smell pass before she entered. None of the maids liked cleaning the room, which usually wasn't a problem because the hotel only filled up once every several years, and Room 60 was last to be rented. She looked around the room, Nothing was left behind and it did not appear to have even been used. The guests NEVER checked out of Room 60. They always just disappeared sometime before the cleaning staff arrived at 4am. Nothing was ever left, and the room looked as pristine as how they left it. Rosa leaned underneath the bed. Using a broom she swept the pile of shiny white rocks towards her. She swept them into dustpan and looked at them. *Every time, teeth.* The staff and the owners of the Ramala Inn didn't talk about the strange occurances in Room 60. Numerous detectives and private investigators had come to their hotel over the years asking questions about missing persons. But there was never anything to be found. No cars, no bodies, no leads. Just a pile of teeth under the bed in an otherwise pristine room. Rosa stripped the comforter off along with the top sheet. Nothing marred the crisp whitness of the fitted sheet below. Never a hair or a sock or any of the usual things maids find in the bed. She billowed out the sheet and put it back into place, fitting the comforter back onto the bed. Rosa felt a slight tingle in her pocket and reached in to retrieve her phone. She sat down on the corner of the bed and started reading a text message from her brother. She felt herself overcome with an overpowering urge to *just lay down, just rest* Her legs felt tingling and warm. She could just...

""You taking a nap in here, Rosa?"" Marcela said as she poked her head around the corner from the outside. Rosa snapped alert and stood up, smoothing out her dress as she did. She grabbed the trashbag of teeth and walked outside, closing the door behind her. 

Marcela gasped and poked Rosa in the butt. ""Aw sweetheart, did you burn your uniform?"" Rosa looked over her shoulder and could see the threadbare holes that suddenly appeared on the butt of her faded blue uniform. The back of her legs felt like they had suffered a bad sunburn. ""Let's just clock out."" Rosa finally answered. ""I'm not going to let Ms. Helen see this, she'll take it out of my paycheck.""

Inside the room, the creature shifted the blanket back into a position that suited it better. Its roots went deep into the earth, and it had a vague knowing of being in existence for a long, long time, burrowing up from the dark places. It knew how to hide, to wait, and take the things of its prey and move them down. 

It hated the teeth that it could not grow itself. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1j4xp9,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j4xp9/room_60/,

     Her lips feathered along his bare chest, stroking him with one hand as she purred, ""Come on baby, it'll be fun."" 
His body trembled with pleasure at her kisses and touch, and the way he pulsed in her grip told her that she had 
him. Still, he refused to answer yes or no. So she quickened her movements on him, bringing her lips and tongue 
to his neck. ""I promise I won't be rough."" She bit him firmly where his neck and shoulder met, grinning then 
releasing with a whisper. ""At least, not too rough."" Her lips pressed over the bite, sucking firmly and massaging 
his skin with her tongue.

     He moaned and brought her lips to his, trying to keep himself from shuddering beneath her. After their lips had 
melded together in several hot, passionate kisses, he mumbled, ""Okay, fine. You can cuff me to the bed if you 
really want to so badly."" He pressed his lips back to hers more firmly than before, raising his arms so his wrists 
were at equal height to the bases of the bed posts.

     With a mischievous smile she returned his kisses, blond hair falling over both their faces. She rolled her hips, 
rubbing her wetness over his stomach, the leather of her boots grazing his thighs as she deftly fastened the 
cuffs to the bedposts and his wrists. Her lips withdrew from his and she looked into his eyes. ""Tell me how badly 
you want me, make me believe it."" She shifted her hips to run her slick slit along his pulsing shaft over and over, 
the friction on her pleasure nub drawing moans from her.

     For a few moments, he tugged at his restraints as he rolled his hips with her, trying to maneuver into her to 
ease his throbbing want. When she masterfully evaded each time he looked up into her eyes letting her see his 
frustration. ""Totally not fair! You can feel how badly I want you far better than any words I can say, and you 
know you're irresistible!"" He let his gaze wander to her swaying, voluptuous breasts, licking his lips as he 
watched, fascinated.

     ""True, true and true."" She grinned, orange eyes mirroring the flames of the surrounding candles. With a 
teasing smile she allowed her entrance to pass over his tip, hips keeping herself out of his reach as he strained to 
enter her. One hand pressed on his chest, supporting her weight, and she traced a single long fingernail down his 
chest. ""But I want you to beg. Beg me for your pleasure. You are completely at my mercy, and unless you plead 
you'll get nothing."" She pulled away, looking down her body at him, dragging her nail more firmly until she drew 
tiny beads of blood and moans from him.

     Still he held his tongue from shaping words, out of naught but stubbornness. He gazed back up into her 
blazing eyes, starting to sweat from the effort to not beg. He watched her lips as she formed more words. ""Beg, 
now! We've already had enough sex for me to sleep peacefully, and I swear I'll leave you cuffed for the night if 
you don't."" He bit his bottom lip as her face set into a stern expression, and she lifted off of him completely, 
dripping on his manhood.

     After several hot drops of her desire he could take no more and tugged at his bonds, wanting to pull her hard 
and deep over him. He murmured, voice breathless, ""Please ride me until my body ceases to move any longer?""

     A grin of dark desire and a flash of secret knowing crossed her face as she slammed down hard and fast upon 
him, impaling herself on his pulsing length. They writhed together in a fit of passion and desire. She kissed his 
straining arms several times, breasts hanging and swaying close enough for him to kiss and lick. Several moments 
later she pulled away and leaned back, hands on her calves, angled so his length pressed against her front wall 
just right to give her the most pleasure she could get.

     Before long he spasmed inside her uncontrollably, relinquishing his pleasure to her. She kept up her pace, 
relentless even after his pleasure came to fruition. She began to rub her sensitive, throbbing nub quickly, making 
herself tremble and sending waves of heat washing over his pulsing length. As her pleasure heightened, her skin 
began to darken from ivory to crimson. His yelps of pleasure-pain stopped, and he looked at her with confusion 
and growing fright.

     It wasn't until the leathery black wings emerged from her back that he screamed. As her teeth elongated and 
became a line of jagged points, making her grin horrid and sinister, he pulled and tugged at the cuffs, their own 
teeth shredding his wrists. Her moans became more ecstatic ash she relished his pain and fear, her hot walls 
starting to crush his pulsing member within her as her pleasure mounted greater heights. Her juices felt like lava 
on his flesh as they coursed from her in rivers.

     At the strongest climax to wrack her body, she splayed a hand over his heart and leaned down, a tongue as 
sharp as a surgeon's scalpel plunging into his heart again and again. She gulped down the spurts of blood that his 
heart pumped out generously, even as his shrieks faded into gurgling, then a drawn-out death rattle.

     She kept licking his body as she relaxed, loving how her tongue flayed his flesh. He was fun, but the lust of a 
succubus is never sated for long.

                              Written by Evan Bennett

The bitter wind blew in through her window, winding along her bare shoulders. Danielle rose from her chair and walked overt to the window, slamming it shut. She peered into the blackness outside. Her house, being in and out of the way the road, had no street lights near it. And the only light in the forest, came from within her home for the heavy clouds covered the moon. She sighed and walked back to her computer. She leaned her head against her left hand and began browsing the web. She soon came to a website devoted to scary stories. She wasn't a big fan of scary stories but she was bored out of her mind and figured a good scare might liven up the night. So she came across a story about the Slenderman. She read the story and the ending sent shivers down her spine but not as much as the picture that accompanied it. The tall man in the picture peered at her with it's pale blank face. She felt, somewhat uncomfortable, as if the man was actually watching her. Soon enough, she forgot about the tall man ans continued browsing the web until she came to a site, the site seemed to be a gallery of men dressed in fireman outfits and the like. More modeling, showing off their chests and what not. She began feeling quite, excited. Her parents were gone for the night and the house was to herself, she figured she might as well take advantage of the situation and enjoy herself. After ten minutes, she finished up and slid down into her chair feeling satisfied. Then she heard a knock at her window. She turned somewhat startled to see a tree branch swaying in the wind, lightly tapping her window. She hauled on her nightgown, then walked over. She didn't remember having a tree this close to her window and noticed the tree seemed to be more dark than any other. It's branches were black as night, and she reached over to feel it. She could feel heat radiating off of it. She snapped her head back and continued gazing at the tree until she closed her window again and began walking backwards into her room towards her computer. She turned to see her computer had turned off and now the room was completely black. She looked again to the window as she made her way to the light switch, and saw the tree was gone. Startled she frantically felt around the room until she felt something, a soft article of clothing. As she lay her hand against it she could feel the heat like she had from the tree. She was very scared and could not say a word. She reached over to the wall with her other hand and found the light switch. The light illuminated the room revealing that her hand was leaning against the crotch of a tall man's pants. She gasped as she drew her hand back and she saw it was the Slenderman who was looking down at her, a two foot difference between them. ""No!"" she jumped back and winged an empty glass bottle of coke at the Slenderman. The bottle struck it in the head and it swung it's long lanky arms up to grab in pain. He fell against her bed holding his head and sobbing. ""Oh, I'm sorry you just scared me, that's all"" she said with a sympathetic tone in her voice. She could not help but feel bad for the guy, his sobbing hit her heart with pity. The same pity you feel when you're in an argument with someone and you make them cry and then instantly feel bad and apologize profusely. he looked up at her, a large red bump on his pale head where he had been hit. Regardless of his lack of face, she still felt she could could make out a miserable expression on it. Danielle sat on the bed and he leaned his head against her shoulder still sobbing. She patted his head and slowly began shushing, trying to calm him down. He looked into her eyes and she into his face. She felt such pity before but suddenly, she was incredibly aroused. She slowly leaned her head close to his and began kissing where his lips would be. He hauled off her white nightgown to reveal black lingerie. She pushed him on to his back and crawled over him, hauling off his black suit until nothing remained on his pale body besides a black pair of boxers and his black tie.  He swung his long arms around and placed his hands on her ass, she yelled energetically as he gave a cheek a quick slap. Then unbuckled her bra and threw it across the room, her breasts swayed and hypnotised him. They continued making out until he stretched his arms across the room and into his pants pocket. He pulled out a small package, on it was a lgo which simply had a circle with an X going through it. He peeled it open and revealed a small condom. He then pulled off his boxers and what was within sent fear down Danielle's spine, Slenderman saw the fear in her eyes and he grabbed it with one hand,""It's so, massive!"" she said while staring wide eyed. Her jaw hung low in disbelief, then suddenly he spoke for the first time that night ""ANAL"". 
A loud scream could be heard from within the house, followed to the sounds akin to a house being raided by the police as glass shattered, tables where knocked over, things were slammed against the door and the legs of the bed where being snapped under the pressure. 

She awoke the next morning, the bright sun shining through the window and onto her face. The window was open and black smudge left along the panes. She stood up and limped over to the computer. A black tie hung off the corner of her monitor and a small note left by the keyboard. It simply said ""I'd get checked out if I were you"" signed Slim Slendy.

I am always on the internet really late, screwing around. But then something strange happened. It was about 2:25 in the morning, and I had just woken up. ""What the hell? Why'd I fall asleep so early?"" I thought to myself. I went to reach for my laptop on the dresser when I heard something. A low breathing sound. It sounded raspy, and almost intermixed with a chuckle. I looked at the other wall and didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I decided I should just go to sleep instead. But I heard that chuckle-like breathing again. It was pitch black in my room, but I thought I could see a face looking at me. I figured it was my imagination. I turned over and fell asleep.

The next day I couldn't get the thought out of my head. What the hell was that sound? So I came up with a plan. I took my old video camera and installed it in the corner of my ceiling, just to put my mind at ease. That night, I didn't go on the computer at all. I went straight to sleep. I was anxious to see what the camera would find, although I felt stupid for thinking there was anything.

I woke up that morning, groggy and still half asleep. But I got up anyway took down the camera. But when I looked at it, it was destroyed. It looked as though something had been shoved straight into the lens. I was terrified now. What the fuck is watching me? What did this? I had to find out. So I went downstairs and got my gun out of the shelf and put it under my pillow. What ever this thing is, I will fuck it up. That day was full of anxiety and nervousness.

I stayed up all night that night. Not like I could sleep anyway. I lay on my pillow, pretending to be asleep. I checked the clock, 1:55. Then I heard my door open. I didn't dare look, not yet. I lay frozen for half an hour, waiting for it to approach me. But it didn't. It just chuckled that raspy chuckle. I couldn't take it anymore, I sat up and looked at whatever it was. And what I saw has kept me awake since. This... thing... it was tall, at least 8 feet. It looked naked, beige, leathery wrinkled skin. It's face though. It had no eyes, just two deep pitch black holes, staring into me. I pointed my gun at it and yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?!"". And it just stared. But then it's face contorted. Where a mouth would be, the flesh ripped away, not bleeding a drop of blood. It's ""mouth"" was connected top to bottom still by unbroken skin. And It chuckled. And then it spoke.
""I am the beast under your bed""
""I am the monster in your closet""
""I am the tapping on your window""
""I am the face in the dark""
""I have been with you since you were born. I will be with you until you die. I am here because, no matter how much you deny my existence, you created me.""
""I am a part of you""
""I. AM. FEAR.""
It suddenly lunged at me. That's when I blacked out.

I woke up that morning. I looked at my body, not a scratch. I looked at my walls. Etched across the ceiling, floor, walls, it was written in some dark, unknown substance:

Jacky, my wife, and I had a terrible fight one morning. I knew it was bad, because when I got home from work that afternoon she was still crying. Jacky kept on getting a lot of phone calls that night and since our house doesn't get good reception, she was continually going outside to take them. It gave us no time to talk and reconcile and before long I was ready for bed. She came to bed, still upset, refusing to even acknowledge me when I tried to hold her.

The next morning I was passing by the comic shop and I had an idea. Jacky and I love watching the Walking Dead together. I had been in there recently and they had these zombie plush dolls. Even though she was scared witless by the zombies, I hoped it would get enough of a laugh to break the tension between us. She wasn’t home when I got there after work so I left it on the front doorstep to give her a bit of a fright, hoping she would just laugh it off and all would be right in the world. As I watched from the lounge she pulled up in the front yard, took one look at the doll. No laugh. Not even a smile. She stormed in and threw it on the couch in frustration, going out side, probably to ring up her parents and bitch about me. Fine if she was going to be this difficult, two could play at this game.

For the next few days Jacky wasn’t home much so I would constantly hide the doll around the house, getting a few shouts of fright. Each time she would just throw it to the floor. Damn women still wouldn’t smile. I knew if I could just get even the slightest curl of that lip, everything would go back to normal.
I was ready to give up. After a week of not talking I knew I had to do something. I stormed into the lounge room holding the doll, ready to rip into her about the childish way she has been acting. She was just sitting on the couch holding one of the photos from the mantle and crying. “I just wish you would come back home” So it was probably a photo of her nan that had passed just over a year ago. I knew what I was about to say was insensitive but I let rip any way. I told her that I was sick of her ignoring me. I was sick of her ringing up her family and friends and bitching about me in the back yard. Then she put the photo down and I realised it was our wedding photo. I placed the doll on the couch and went to go pick up the photo. As I did Jacky screamed. “Why the hell does this doll keep popping up everywhere!” She ran straight outside, threw it in the bin and got on the phone to her parents. I finally went outside to try and talk to her again and heard her talking to her parents. “This doll popped up on my doorstep a week ago and now everywhere I go, it keeps showing up. It’s like my friends are playing a prank on me. How can someone do this, especially with Dave’s funeral on Friday”. I was was so angry by this point I was only half paying attention as I grabbed the doll from the bin. It was an expensive doll and if she wasn't going to appreciate it then I was still going to keep it. After I got inside I threw it in the wash. She followed moments later, took one look at it and screamed. She just got in the car and drove away.

It’s been two days since. I just wish she would come back home.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1362036126.0,,,True,t3_19dpnt,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/19dpnt/the_plush_doll/,

______________________


“No,” I said. “It's Friday; why would I want to spend all night hanging out with you at work?”


“Because,” Jeannie said, flashing me her man-eater grin, “the motherfucker's haunted.”


Which settled that.


I tucked my keys into my pocket around nine and left the dorm, hauling ass downtown just in time to meet Jeannie for her nightly break. We stood on the sidewalk outside the hotel, passing a clove cigarette back and forth, the sweet smoke whirling away into the September air.


“It's not exactly The Overlook,” I deadpanned, and I was right. The White Inn was a local landmark, built back at the turn of the century, but it lacked the beauty and character of most old buildings. Living up to its name and not an inch more, it was a three-story cube with a pillared porch. Even from the sidewalk, even in the dim glow of the streetlight, I could see the many layers of once-white paint chipping away, sometimes pulling away from the structure in long scabby strips.


Jeannie passed me the cigarette, blew a smoke ring. She had started working the night shift at the inn a couple of nights a week solely to keep herself in cigarettes, peach schnapps, and the occasional joint. “Nah, it sucks. Some decent stories though. If any of them are true.”


I took the last drag, pocketed the butt, and followed Jeannie inside.


“Parlor,” she said, gesturing to the left. “Sitting room, front desk, obviously. Dining room over here, and kitchen past that.”


I wandered through the first floor, rapidly losing patience. The motherfucker was many things, but haunted wasn't one of them. Jeez, Jeannie should have known that. One of our earliest roommate bonding experiences had been realizing we each got the same spinal frisson while working stage crew at the school's oldest theater where a long-dead actress was rumored to move props and pinch sopranos. Ghosts were palpable, we'd always agreed, and spiritual energy could be tasted on the back of the tongue, like batteries or bad wine.


Not that it wasn't spooky in there, all alone, at night. Even the soft rubber of my sneakers echoed on the hardwood floors. The parlor was full of mirrors that threw my face at me from every direction, and with only the check-in desk lamp to light the whole first floor, the effect was eerie. The sitting room boasted furniture that was worn and used enough to give off a musty smell, but not old or pristine enough to qualify as antique. There were too many pieces crowded into the room and shadows swam around my shoulders.


The White Inn got just enough business to stay open year after year, and once Alumni Weekend rolled around, it would be fair bursting with guests. But there were stretches of emptiness, and this was one of them.


“No guests at all?” I asked, propping my elbows on the front desk.


“Nope,” Jeannie confirmed. She was behind the desk, collecting a heavy key ring from a drawer. She held up the keys triumphantly. “That's why I can give you the grand tour.”


She led me upstairs, and then, only then, did I realize why she had brought me here.


At the first landing, I felt it: the tingle started in my neck and worked down my spine till it felt like all the tiny bones were encased in an icy-hot sleeve. The frisson from the old theater; the pressure, the shift in the air, the hint of electricity, the undeniable feeling that all was not well.


She glanced at me, the wicked grin gone. “Did you feel that?” we said in unison. It would have been funny, a real Scooby-Doo moment, if either of us had possessed enough extra breath to laugh. All the oxygen had gone out of the air, as though it was Everest we were climbing instead of a set of creaking stairs in a small-town hotel.


The second and third floors were all guest rooms, and as such, they were illuminated twenty-four-seven by overhead fluorescents. Jeannie's olive complexion went sallow as we reached the top of the steps and ducked into second floor corridor, the light bleaching her away, flattening the gloss of her black Velma Kelly bob. I looked one direction, then the other. The hallway to the left was short, holding only four doors; the righthand hallway stretched further and featured a sharp corner halfway down.


“Guess someone died here,” Jeannie said, gesturing to the first door on the left. “Can't remember how, it'll come to me.”


She was speaking in the hushed tones usually reserved for libraries and funerals. “The really good one is the other way. A guy stabbed his boyfriend and left him in the bathtub. He was halfway to Tucson before they caught up with him. Roger says he knows a guy who can lead a séance, but since I don't think Roger can even spell 'unquiet dead'...”


She trailed off, watching me stare down the lefthand hallway. There was nothing there. Four doors. Fluorescent lights. Non-descript brown carpet, the better to hide stains. Boring daisy wallpaper. I stared. The tingle in my spine faded, leaving me with a run-of-the-mill adrenaline spike and shaky hands.


Finally, she bonked my shoulder. “Come on. The best one's this way.”


She went right. I followed behind her, trailing my hand along the daisy wallpaper.


Jeannie disappeared around the corner. I paused, and in the instant I did, I heard the gasp. A sharp intake of breath, nearly covered by the shuffle of our feet along the brown carpet, but unmistakable. A gasp. Not from ahead. From behind.


Just as there is nothing so terrifying as sounds behind a closed door, there is also nothing quite so disheartening as really not wanting to turn around and knowing that you must.


I whirled, staring wildly down the short lefthand hallway. Fluorescent lights. Four closed doors. Brown. Daisies. The normalcy of the scene stabbed at me, the silence pounding against my eardrums. It wasn't right, there was something there, my brain insisted, but my senses told me no, actually, there wasn't, and the argument between reason and panic made my breath come short and fast.


I heard it, I thought, trying to look everywhere at once, certain I had missed something, certain that any minute the gasping thing would peel itself into view and reach a wasting arm for me... My spine throbbed. I know I heard it.


I gaped blankly at the mundane scene before me. There wasn't even a wrongness of angles, a trick of light that I could blame my fear upon. The hallway looked like any hallway in any not-quite-The-Overlook in any town in America. But the gasp echoed in my ears, the high, sharp inhalation of breath, and the plain hallway seemed unspeakably sinister for its lack of monstrosity.


And then, my eyes twitched, and refocused before I even realized what they were seeing. The hallway shifted into blurs and my gaze tightened on the thing an inch from my face.


A spider. White.


Hanging from the ceiling on a nearly invisible filament was a white spider. It was level with my nose; another step and I'd have swallowed it, but it didn't swing in the wake of my heaving breath, didn't busily work its little white spider legs. It hung there, not even a half inch from leg to leg.


It had been there the whole time, I realized, and my unease on finding the hallway empty had been justified; I'd been so close to the white spider my eyes hadn't been able to focus on it, but they must have registered its presence on some level. Nearsightedness had always been a minor inconvenience, but this time, it had scared me half to death.


The spider hung motionless, an opal pendulum. Its back legs clung to its webbing, but the rest hung down, slack and loose. Its eyes were either absent or so white that they couldn't be distinguished from its pearlescent little back.


I stared at the white spider, not daring to jerk away. Spiders don't gasp, but God doesn't play dice either, and I had no idea what it meant to find this-


“Are you coming or what? Christ!”


Jeannie poked her head around the corner in the righthand hallway. Either I was in too much shock to show it, or she assumed the fluorescent lights had worked their unflattering magic on me, because she didn't seem to realize anything was wrong.


I looked back, not even a little surprised to see that the spider was gone.


“Yeah, I'm coming.”


Jeannie showed me the righthand hallway's sights, opening up a suite at the end where two men had entered and only one had left. We wandered through the third floor, then took a trembling, rattling elevator (devoid of blood, thank you very much) down to the lobby. We drank sodas from the machine at the front desk and Jeannie regaled me with rumor after rumor.


“The boyfriends are a sure thing, and so was Mrs. White,” Jeannie said. “George showed me the newspaper clippings from those. But all the rest might be crap. You know how certain places get a rep. Like every movie theater, every stage, every hotel, must be crawling with ghosts if you believe all the stories. Just sells more tickets and beds, I guess.”


I was flicking the tab back and forth on my pop can, but I looked up, something sticking in my mind like a fly in a web. “The boyfriends.”


“Yeah, the murdering gay guys? True fact. Want another cigarette? I'm ready for some air.”


I put my hand on her arm to stop her from getting up. “You said something else. The boyfriends and who?”


“Oh! Mrs. White,” she said, waggling her eyebrows. “That's the one I couldn't remember before.”


“True fact?” I asked, my mind winding up the stairs, into the hall, turning to the left...


“Legit. Not the owner's sister, but maybe her sister-in-law? I can't remember,” Jeannie said. She blew her bangs out of her eyes, thinking. The wisps floated back down like spider silk. “Cousin, maybe. She killed herself while she was visiting. Anyway, that was on the second floor, too. Top of the stairs.


“Damn,” she said, slapping the desk. “I should have opened that one up too. Want to go back?”


My hands fell away from the poptop and I gripped the desk. “What happened to her?”


“Are you okay?” Jeannie looked me over. “Did you see something?”


“Just-” I licked my lips. I was staring at Jeannie, but not really seeing her. Instead, I knew there something just out of my focus, an answer I could not yet see. “Just tell me what happened.”


“I told you. She killed herself. It's not a great story, though, because no one really knows why. Just one night while she was staying here, visiting her sister or sister-in-law or whatever, she went up to bed and then... next day, they found her.”


“Where? How?” I whispered, a tiny gasp of air that I barely heard myself. Jeannie answered-


“Just outside the first room on the left. There's a pipe in the ceiling under the particle board.”


-but I found that my sight had shifted and I already knew-

Do you know that feeling, that voice at the back of your head, always there but not always active. You try to make a decision, and it pipes up again. It feels like a second person inside your head.

I was 15 years old, out with my friends. Us younglings were being idiots like we all do when we’re young, and someone had convinced us to go bungee jumping. That's when it started.

I had all the gear on, safety harness and all. That’s when it started. It was the 16th of May, on Insert Bridge and not the best day to go outside. Not cold or rainy, just eerie. The mist shrouded the mountains around the bridge. And there was the voice. Out of nowhere. “Go on, Tom. Jump. Go on.” It was faint, it was almost like it wasn’t me talking, some sort of being taking control.


“You’re so slow, Thomas. We’re waiting for you!” cried Andrew.


“Stop your whining, Whingy.”


“Shut up! Let’s just go, Joel.”


That’s when I spoke up. “Hey guys, I… Uhh… I might not do this.” There was the voice again. “What are you doing? You know you want to jump.”


“Hey Tom!” I look around to Joel, he stares at me for a second blankly. “Nnnnnnnncluck! Cluck, cluck! Buq buq buq!” Andrew joined in. Their cruel cries tortured me, if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s being called weak. The voice started laughing. “Fine. Let’s go.” I get into my harness and stand at the edge of Insert Bridge. “You go first, Tom. We want to see you fall” said Joel. The instructor steps up behind me. “3! 2! 1!” The voice starts to laugh. “Jump!” I fall off the bridge, and I hear a snap.


My vision was blurry and absolutely everything hurt. I could make out was that I was at the mouth of some sort of cavern or cave. I could see the river underneath Insert Bridge and it was absolutely pouring. I was soaked to the bone. I attempted to get up but was soon followed by a sharp, searing pain shooting up my right leg, starting from my ankle and ending at my knee. Something wasn’t right. I lay there for a while more, just thinking about what happened, I had completely forgotten about the voice. And there it was. It felt like something was watching me, something in my presence. I turned around and saw nothing, turned back around and a flicker at the corner of my eye.


By now I had established that there was something else here, whether it was an animal or a human, or neither, it was alive. I was immediately aware, my body rejected all the pain and pushed it away. My senses came back to life and I could feel everything. I tried to look around but my neck locked in place, the muscles denied the input from my brain. Everything around me turned cold and lifeless and I felt something coming up behind me. I began to lose consciousness but not from pain or injury, even though my injuries were great. It felt like everything was shifting away to the back of my mind, and something was taking over. It had replaced me. I could still hear everything. I could still acknowledge everything that happened to and around me. I just couldn't control my body. I didn't know what it was, it seemed dark and evil so I was too scared to try and communicate. My body rises, shaking and jittering and my face forms a grin.


""Tom! Tom!"" I could hear sirens. Flashing lights and everything around me was dark, penetrating my mind. ""You're alive! Guys, Tom's alive!"" Joel began to cry and smile at the exact same time. ""You stupid, STUPID kid! You had me worried sick! I, I thought you died!"" The crying had taken over. He came up to me, slammed his fists on my chest and proceeded to hug me with the force of a million bears. Mind you, I still hadn't said anything yet. In the midst of the happiness I was feeling, I forgot my fears of this being that had infected my mind and attempted to talk. What I thought came out of my mouth. ""Oh my God, Joel! I can't believe I'm still alive! The craziest thing happened! I fell in a cave and then there was this thing and the-"" I stopped. I wasn't speaking.


By this time I was in the back of the ambulance with all the guys, the nurse had gone on and on about how I'm lucky to be alive. A few moments later, my friends realised I'd stopped talking. Well, it wasn't exactly me, guess it was my body, but I had no way to tell them, but- Never mind. It took the nurses a while to diagnose what was wrong. At first they thought it was a coma but they realised that I was still reacting and moving, so they ruled that out. Apparently I'm mute from shock and unable to talk for a while. I'm not going to lie, I'm angry. This thing inside my head is still here, still there, still planted, and you know what? That's exactly what's going to happen. I think it's like a seed, and it will grow. I don't know what it will grow on, but it will. If I can figure that out, then I might be able to get rid of it. Well, that's what the voice at the back of my head tells me.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_v7rih,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/v7rih/the_voice_at_the_back_of_your_head/,

The house is noisy again. It has been quiet for so long, the silence deafening to me. I never quite got used to being alone here, but that is all over now. You are here to stay.



**March 9th**

You have been here a day, and I have not yet seen you. The house is large, I hope you come to this room soon.



**March 10th**

I can see the activity outside the window from here, a large carriage moving all of your belongings, but none of the people I've seen so far have been you. They dress in one-piece suits, so I think they are just servants. You must be very important to have this many people doing your work for you. I really cannot wait to meet you now.



**March 11th**

You have finally shown yourself. I had imagined someone taller, more well dressed. The garments you clad yourself in are strange to me. Why must you break away parts of the room? You are causing ruckus which does not belong here. 



**March 12th**

I have been listening to you as you tear down my room. What are you doing? Why are you doing it? It is my room, not yours. You speak to someone who is not there. As if you have madness in your mind. You have begun basting the walls of my room with pink. I think I understand what you are doing now. Very well; I can wait.



**March 13th**

You have finished with this room, you have made it as new. You speak with the voices in your head more and more. Is something going to happen to you? It cannot. Not yet. You must set back what you have done.



**March 19th**

Everything has been quiet again here for the last few days. You left and did not come back. I thought you had abandoned this place. It is good to see you have returned. I could not have imagined, in my wildest fantasy, a better outcome than this. You have brought with you a woman and a small life. You have brought with you a small life and placed it in my room. 



**March 20th**

I watch the small life as it sleeps. I watch over it, waiting for the right time. When you are not here, I communicate with it. My repeated attempts to communicate with you failed, but the little life has a supple mind which I am able to reach. I have learned much by observing this ""toddler"".



**March 21st**

I have watched you as you sit in this room observing the little life. You cannot see me, can you? You wonder out loud if the little life is vain, and smile and laugh as it touches the glass. You have no idea. You watch as I play with it. Each time our hands meet on the glass, a little bit more of myself is transferred to that side, and a little bit more of it is transferred to this side. It is a strange feeling, sharing two bodies. I am still unable to exact control on the other side. I can wait.



**March 22nd**

It is complete. I sit on the bed, looking out of the window. The sun feels warm. I had forgotten. Today I feigned tears, and screamed and cried when you tried to show me that the mirror shows only my reflection. As we left that room for the last time, I looked back at her. She was crying. But you did not notice. I like my new room. It's just as I remember.

This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly of the internet. I’ve seen quite a few things I don’t care to admit to, but one thing that I’ll always remember is a site called “normalpornfornormalpeople.com”.

The first strange thing about the site, was that I didn’t find it by actually looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn’t know. The e-mail was as follows:

    “Hi there 

    found this site is very nice thought u might like 

    normalpornfornormalpeople.com 

    pass it on, for the good of mankind” 

Pretty standard issue chain letter, although the url and the last remark really piqued my curiosity. I was having a very boring day when I got this, so I made sure my anti-virus was working and then I clicked on it.

It was a very average, very generic looking site. It gave the impression that the creators just BARELY gave a shit about making it look professional. The author seemed to have a very tenuous grasp on English, and on the front page was a long, boring, and incoherent rant that I don’t remember or have saved.

The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven’t figured out the meaning of), which was;

    “Normal Porn for Normal People, A Website Dedicated To The Eradication of Abnormal Sexuality” 

And from the sound of that, I wasn’t sure whether I was here to watch porn or if I had stumbled onto some kind of eugenics program. But I was here now, and I was very, very curious to see what “Normal People” get their rocks off to. So I scrolled down through the rant and…nothing. The page didn’t seem to link to anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was it’s own hyperlink. So I clicked one of them, and was sent to a white page with very long list of links in the form of:

    “normalpornfornormalpeople.com/ (random letters)” 

So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will rape my computer. I figured I’d just try it for maybe 5 minutes, just to see if anything came up. I clicked one of the links, and was sent to another page. This page apparently had totally different urls than the last one.

I was just about to say “Fuck this” when I clicked on the 3rd link, and a video download came up. It was called “peanut.avi”. It was a 30 minute video of a man, a woman and a dog in a kitchen. The woman would make a peanut butter sandwich, and the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for 30 minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of it.

I know what you’re thinking: “What the hell does that have to do with porn?” I have no clue. I’ve seen a little over two dozen videos from this site, and the majority had no sexual activity at all.

After watching peanut.avi, I went on a certain image board I frequent to play online show and tell, like I always do with weird shit like this. But someone had already made a thread about it, some guy who had received the same chain letter I did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig through the site, and that’s how I saw other videos.

Most of those two dozen videos where very uneventful, and consisted of people talking to the cameraman in a room with nothing in it but a desk and a few chairs. I mean literally nothing on the walls, or in terms of furniture. The whole room had a very cold, sterile feel to it.

The conversations where just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people where filming or what the site was about, but of course, nothing. You would never know these videos had anything to do with porn if you saw it out of context. I will say one thing though, the people who appeared in these videos where quite attractive.

However, the other videos that actually did feature content which I suppose could be called “sexual” is where things got weird.

I’ll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos, if you’re really eaten up with curiosity you can try to hunt them down on a torrent site.

lickedclean.avi     A 10 minute video filmed by a hidden camera in which we see a repairman working on a washing machine for the first 2 minutes. When it’s fixed, the repairman talks to the owner briefly, and then leaves. The owner checks to make sure the repairman is gone, and he begins to lick all over the top of the washing machine. This goes on for 7 minutes. 

jimbo.avi

    A 5 minute video of a obese mime performing his act. It was actually pretty funny, particularly one part where he pretends to pull up a chair, then pretends that it breaks because of his weight. In the last 30 seconds of the video, the camera cuts to static briefly and cuts back to the man sobbing quietly, still wearing mime outfit and makeup. Some kind of obscure fetish? 

dianna.avi

    4 minute video in which the camerman talks to a woman in a room different than the “interview room”. This room looks like one you’d find in a normal person’s house. Exactly where they are is never specified, as Dianna only talks about her violin playing. She obviously plays her violin, but she keeps getting distracted by something. 

    I didn’t notice this until someone on the image board thread pointed it out, but if you look at a mirror in the background, you can see a fat man in a chicken mask masturbating. 

jessica.avi

    Another 4 minute cameraman video. This time he’s outside a house, talking to another young woman. They talk about canoe rides. The camera zooms out to reveal the city streets behind them occasionally. 

    The strange thing is: No one so far has been able to identify where this street is. Guesses have ranged everywhere from Europe to Australia to The Philippines, but there’s yet to be a match for the street shown in the video. 

tounguetied.avi

    10 minute video. The first 5 minutes consist of an elderly woman making out with a mannequin. The video cuts out like it did in jimbo.avi halfway through, and the scene is now a group of mannequins huddled together in a circle around the camera. The lights have been dimmed, and the elderly woman is nowhere to be seen. From this point on, there is no sound. stumps.avi

    5 minute long video where a man with no legs is attempting to breakdance on a DDR mat in what looks like the kitchen from peanut.avi, but much dirtier. There’s a radio playing music unseen in the background, but it stops at the 4 minute mark when the man collapses on the mat in exhaustion. 

    He breathes heavily and pleads with someone off-screen to let him rest. This off-screen person becomes terrifyingly enraged and yells at him to keep dancing, which he does. You can hear this off-screen person begin to scream as the video ends abruptly. 

privacy.avi

    The woman from dianna.avi is masturbating on a mattress in the “interview room”, while the man from stumps.avi walks around on his hands while wearing some kind of goblin mask. 

    The door in this room was always closed in other videos, but it’s now open. In this video the only light is in the room, and the hallway is dark. Near the end of the video, you can see an animal quickly run through the hallway. 

And finally the last video we uncovered: useless.avi

    In this 18 minute video, a blond woman from one of the previous interview videos is tied down to a mattress in the interview room. She attempts to scream but her mouth is taped over. After 7 minutes, a man in a black suit and mask opens the door, but he does not enter. 

    He holds the door open for the animal that was running in the hall in the previous video. It’s revealed to be an adult chimpanzee, it’s hair shaved and it’s entire body painted red. It seemed to be starved and abused, with several wounds along it’s shoulders and back.     When the chimp enters the room, the masked man closes the door behind it. The chimpanzee sniffs the air for a moment (it may have been blind), and notices the woman tied to the mattress. It goes into a frenzy, and begins to maul her. 

    The assault goes on for a grueling 7 minutes, until the woman finally dies. The chimp eats flesh from her corpse for 4 minutes as the video ends. 


The thread exploded with activity after this video was uncovered, and people discussed it long into the night. When I came back to the image board the next day I found that the thread was deleted. I tried to start another one, and they banned me. I tried e-mailing the guy who sent me the chain letter with the site’s url, sent him 5 messages and never got a response.

I have tried to discuss this website on various places, and I got banned frequently. The site itself was also deleted about 3 days after useless.avi was uncovered, likely because someone contacted the authorities about it.

The only proof that normalpornfornormalpeople.com ever existed was a few screencaps people took, and videos from the site that people saved and uploaded on torrents. The most popular of which being useless.avi, which found it’s way onto a few gore sites.

Wherever you upload them to, all of the videos from normalpornfornormalpeople.com get deleted after a while.

A mother and daughter walk into a hotel lobby, dragging their entire lives in a pair of suitcases behind them.  The Daughter is about 13 years old; a carrier bag slung over her shoulder with a lap dog inside; she looks like she’s been crying for hours.  The Mother is in her mid- to late-30s; she quietly carries her own burdens that make her look over her shoulder with extra caution.  They both wear that tired, haunted expression of people who have been driving all day under the worst imaginable circumstances.  They have hit a wall of exhaustion and this nameless, unexceptional airport hotel is the closest thing they can find to respite.

In the background, a few people are checking out of the hotel.  Dropping off key cards, settling bills, dragging suitcases.  Although they seem rested, they wear their own dull, dazed expressions.  This hotel is a way station in the middle of nowhere.  No one stays here for longer than one night and a stay here invariably means you’re still a long way from your final destination.

The Daughter gravitates toward an old, circus-themed pinball machine in a corner of the lobby.  She slaps the flipper buttons a few times before realizing that the machine is dead; the dust caked on the glass suggests it’s probably been sitting in disrepair for a small eternity.  Disappointed, she sits on her suitcase and has a staring contest with her dog as her Mother checks them in at the front desk.

They make their way to the elevator banks where an airline pilot and two flight attendants are waiting with their luggage.  They look like they’ve been through their own harrowing evening but manage to smile sympathetically at the weary-looking mother and child.  The Older Flight Attendant crouches toward the Daughter and admires her dog.

“What’s his name?”

“She’s a girl.  Her name’s Diablo.”

“Pretty name.  She’s lucky to have you.”

The slight frown on the Daughter’s face doesn’t budge.  The elevator arrives: an antiquated deathtrap with a claustrophobic cab.  Parts of this hotel are clearly overdue for renovations.  The aircrew lets the Mother and Daughter take it.

The elevator lifts off with a heavy, ominous churning sound.  The Mother places her arm around her Daughter.  The Daughter pulls away.  They’ve reached a point in their trip where words are meaningless.

They arrive at their floor and drag their suitcases down the carpeted hallway.  The Mother scans the numbers on the identical doors.  They pass by a middle-aged man in a gray suit and glasses, carrying his suitcase into his room; the Businessman nods hello at them but they are in their own world.

The Mother stops at a door and tries her key card.  The door won’t open.  She tries a few more times, getting flustered.  The Daughter sits down on the floor and hugs the carrier bag to her chest, absently noticing a patch of floral-patterned wallpaper peeling off the wall.  The exposed corner of wall is covered in rust.

The Businessman approaches them, offers to assist.  He flips the key card around and slips it into the slot:  *green light*.  The door opens easily.  He helps carry their suitcases into their room.

“Thanks,” says the Mother, as an apology and as a polite invitation for him to leave.  “We’ve had a long day.”

“I’m right next door, if you need anything,” he offers, lingering a little longer than comfortable before he lets himself out.

In the hallway, the Businessman returns to his room as the aircrew passes by him.  They head further down the hall, to the two adjacent rooms they’ve secured.  The Flight Attendants in one room with the Captain on his own.

The Captain pauses at his door.  “If either of you ladies are looking to forget the flight we just endured, I’ll be in my room dismantling the mini bar.”

● ● ●

The Captain steps into his room.  Drops his suitcase in a corner.  Heads straight for the mini-fridge beside the television.

● ● ●

The Flight Attendants walk into their room.  The Older flops on her bed as the Younger begins to unbutton her uniform.

● ● ●

The Businessman sits in the dark on the edge of his bed, numbly flipping through channels.  Weather.  Static.  Pay-Per-View Porn.  Static.  Local news.  His unblinking eyes glaze beneath the sieve of his pristine glasses.  The warm glow of television light reflecting off his lenses, flickering to darkness each time he changes the station, creating a strobe effect.  A private ritual he’s done a hundred times in a hundred different hotel rooms over the years.  Watch him for a moment and he just looks sad; watch him for a few moments longer and he looks downright insane.

● ● ●

The Mother leans against a dresser with a thousand-yard stare.  The Daughter sits on the bed and lets her dog out of its carrier.  The dog scampers about the hotel room and pisses in a corner.  Mother and Daughter are both too numb to react.

The Mother breaks the silence:  “You know, we’re going to be fine, right?”

“Where are we going?”

“Somewhere far.  Far enough to be safe.”

“We’re not safe now?”

The Mother lets out a deep sigh that seems to relieve tension pent up in her body.  “Sure we are.  No one’s going to hurt us here.  We’re just in the middle of nowhere.  We’ll find someplace new to settle down.  Start over.”

“Does that mean we can never go back home?”

This seems to sting the Mother more than she’d care to let on.

“I don’t think we want to go back, sweetie.”

The Daughter tears up.  “You didn’t let me say goodbye to any of my friends.  Not even Jenny.”

“I know you must think I’m some kind of monster but I’m doing the best I can.  We’re on our own now.  I promise we’ll find someplace really nice and you’ll meet new friends—”

“How do you know that?  You don’t even know where we’re going!  You think it’s easy making new friends?  I could be miserable...”

“Becky, stop it.  You just have to trust me.”

The dog leaps up onto the bed.  The Daughter grabs her into her lap and strokes her as she sulks.  The Mother walks over and sits down on the bed, at a loss for words.  She picks up a laminated menu on the nightstand, sets it down before the Daughter.  “You must be starved.  I’m starved.  Order us something to eat while I wash up.”

The Mother heads to the bathroom, flicks on the aging fluorescents: a modest, inviting bathroom filled with single-use items.  She closes the door.  Turns on the faucets.  Blasts the shower.  Under the cover of running water, she slumps down in a corner far away from the door and has a nervous breakdown.

Out in the bedroom, the Daughter can hear the sounds of crying through the door.  She tunes the television to a dead channel to drown out the sound.  Looks over the laminated menu.  Reaches for the phone.
In the next room, the Businessman listens to the sound of crying leak from the vent in his bathroom.

● ● ●

The Older Flight Attendant lets her hair down as she sorts through her suitcase.  The Younger stands by in a bathrobe, looking more shaken.  “How often does something like that happen?”

The Older brushes this off.  “Every so often,” she lies.  “When you do this long enough, you’ll wish for nights like tonight, just to break up the monotony.”

“What do you mean by ‘monotony’?”

“The boredom, hon.”

“Why didn’t you just say ‘boredom’?”

“Look, the skies can be unpredictable.  Davis is the best in the business.  He’s been flying longer than I’ve been walking the aisles.  We hit a rough patch of air up there, that’s all.  Passengers get on edge when they think they might die.”

“Was he drunk?”

“He’s strictly an off-hours drunk.  He was stone-cold sober tonight.”

“How do you know?”

“Because we’re alive and not being covered by the evening news.  Take a shower, Erica.  Rinse off the flight.  You’ll feel better.”

The Younger heads to the bathroom.  Runs the shower: calcium deposits in the shower head skew the stream and it blasts her face.  She shrieks with surprise and adjusts the angle.  Drops her bathrobe.  Steps in.  Steams rises up.  She lathers shampoo into her hair.  The surveillance camera in the room suddenly zooms in and we get a closer appraisal of her anatomy...

● ● ●

Elsewhere, a security camera is fixed upon a figure watching the surveillance camera feeds.  The Watcher sits silhouetted against the light of HD screens.  His attention currently focused upon the feed of the Younger Flight Attendant taking a shower.  He remotely controls the camera as he quietly observes her.

● ● ●

The Captain opens the door and lets the Older Flight Attendant into his room.

The bed is littered with empty little bottles of booze.  The Captain cracks the seal on a fresh bottle.

“Close to killing the mini.  May have to graduate to the hotel bar in the lobby.”

“Were you drunk up there tonight?”

“Have a drink, Heather, you’re way too sober.”

“I want to know what was going on in that cockpit.”

“I’m going to need you to drink a lot more before I start opening up about what happened up there.”

● ● ●

The Mother steps out of the bathroom.  The Daughter has fallen asleep on the bed.  The dog is barking as someone raps lightly on the door.  The Mother opens the door and lets a service attendant push a food cart into the room.

“How much do I—?”

The attendant leaves without making eye contact, without saying a word.

She removes the cover from a plate, revealing a burger and fries.  She chews on a fry as she takes a long look at her sleeping daughter.  Completely at peace.  The dog runs to the food cart and starts yapping at it.

The Mother pulls some covers over her Daughter.  The Daughter instinctively clutches onto the sheets as she settles in.

The Mother grabs her purse and quietly heads out the door.

A moment passes after she leaves...

... and then a fine, white gas billows out from beneath the food cart... the small dog’s barking begins to slow... as if he were a wind-up toy winding down...

All rightly rights belong to the righty rightful right owners.
Warning: Has gore and what not, get over it.




My avid interest in the human body began as a young teen, but it was so subtle. It began with tiny things, taking apart mechanical things—Remotes, electronics, even a bed. I was so curious; I just wanted to know what made up these things. What made them move, come alive, do what they do. It was such a fantastic mystery, pulling apart a computer to find millions of parts that hum and vibrate. The only problem is that I could never put the mess of bolts and bits back together. Eventually my parents got sick of me destroying things in the house so they would buy me books to try and quell my unrestrained desire to pull apart objects. Sadly that only subdued me for so long. After being hit, beaten, and screamed at by my parents I stopped, until I started learning about the anatomy of animals.


I think we’ve all squished spiders and killed ants…whatever the reason may have been, it happened. I did this as a kid, but I never thought about cutting them open and taking a look inside them. It was a summer day, and I was relaxing outside. Our dog, Alex, brought me a present, a rat. I remember ripping it from Alex’s grasp, feeling the rat, which was still alive, squirm and struggle. I would have thrown it away and forgotten about it but I felt something. A pulse, a single heart beat. I had felt my own before, but never thought much of it. Now I had something that shared a piece of me. I was so curious and ecstatic to find out what made it beat and move. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and went on the back patio. I held the rat down on the little table we had out there and began to saw my way into the rat’s body. I only got so far till I hit the ribs, so at that point I dug my finger nails into the incisions I had made and began to pull apart the skin. I dug further into the rat and pulled apart the ribs, snapping them and tossing them in the trash behind me. I had pulled apart almost all of its ribs, so I had a clear view of the rat’s heart. I was amazed, but disappointed. In my haste, I had forgotten that I was killing it. The heart was still and broken, and I frowned. What point was looking at it now? In my anger I began slicing at random, tearing the rat to shreds and covering the table in guts and blood. After I could cut no longer, my anger ceased. I looked down at the bloody mess on the table and my hands. I heard car on gravel, and knew my parents had come home. I quickly washed off the blood and tossed the bones and guts in the woods.



As I grew older, it grew to other things. I occasionally cut open a mole or squirrel but I was always so careful. All I wanted is to see the heart beat, but every time I got that deep the animal would die. I would grow frustrated and mutilate what was left of it. I had to be sure my parents never found out and what I did was a secret. The closest I ever came to getting caught was in high school. We were in biology, and we were learning about the anatomy of animals. Specifically, the frog…And I had been waiting so long for the day we would get to dissect it. It came painfully slow, and when it did come I was so joyful and ecstatic I was shaking. Frogs didn’t usually hang around my house, so this was a first time experience. We were working in pairs and I hadn’t even noticed who my partner was. My face lit up when my teach set down a small metal tray with 2 frogs neatly taped to it. We were separated into sections with small walls in-between each section, giving everyone privacy. Each section had a small trashcan under the table to dispose of the frogs. I sat down next to my partner and took the scalpel and my partner began to talk about what we to do…I completely ignored him. I began cutting away; inspecting and savoring each thing I cut out. It went from a slow and steady pace to a rampage. I simply cut and cut, feeling a growing sense of bliss. My partner stared with complete disbelief at me, but I continued. Soon there was nothing left on the tray except the other frog and a pile of unrecognizable guts and pieces. I calmly dumped my bits into the trashcan, walked up to the teacher and told her I had to go to the nurse. My partner never spoke to me ever again.



But now…I can’t contain it anymore. I went to medical school to try and become and surgeon but I can’t wait. This morning I called the cable company complaining about my TV acting up, and they sent a mechanic over. I told him that my TV was in the basement. I followed him down the stairs and before he could ask where the TV was, I took a metal baseball bat and hit him over the head. I tied him to the bed and began to sharpen my butcher knife. When he came to his senses I had just finished sharpening the knife. He struggled against his leather restraints as I brought the knife near his hand. Turning the knife sideways I began to slowly peel the skin away. I had given him pain killers but the look on his face was of pure terror. He tried to scream out loud but I had gagged him. I dug the knife into his raw hand just half an inch, and began to peel away little bits of muscle and skin. I had reached the tendons, and one by one I began to pluck them out. Each pluck sent a shock through his body, and finally I undid his hand strap. He tried to move his hand, but it hung limply. He was barley conscious now, so I gave him more painkillers. I then began to work at his legs, repeating the process I did with his hands. Now his legs were raw and both his hands and his legs were bleeding freely. Before I could finish his legs he passed out, and his legs stopped struggling. I got angry, and fell into my old habits. I slashed and stabbed his legs, ripping them to shreds until I reached bone. I sharpened my knife again and began to cut his fingers off, one by one. He died as soon as I began this process. I got so frustrated; I didn’t even begin his head or torso. I began sawing away at his face, ripping out chunks of flesh. I cut a laceration from ear to ear, ripping open his mouth. I cut his throat near the top and pulled his tongue through. I finished by completely ripping his vocal cords out and cutting all along his neck.


I got too curious, so frustrated that everything died before I could finish. I had a wild idea, what about me? I smiled and brought the knife to the upper left part of my torso, where the heart was. I took as many painkillers as I could and began to cut and cut. Looking down at my bloody torso I felt pure and utter joy, and then it happened. I pulled out a small red object, and it gave a single beat.


...One slow and utter beat, and then it stopped.

Whether you believe it or not is entirely up to you. I know it happened. I was there, I saw it all. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll start at the beginning.

It was August 27th, 2012. I was on my way home from work, and I was very excited. At midnight tonight, Guild Wars 2 would launch, and I had an entire night planned playing with my friends. I worked the late shift, so I got off at around 10:30, immediately headed to the store to buy it. My friends and I waited in line for an eternity. I had pre-ordered the limited edition, and was eager to get my hands on it. I had never been one to play MMOs. WoW had never interested me, and the only thing close to one that I had played had been Runescape. But that had been years ago. My friends recommended Guild Wars to me, and I had fallen in love with the story and the fact that it was free to play. So, needless to say, waiting in line was becomming increasingly difficult.

Finally getting my hands on the copy, I rushed home, swinging by the grocery to pick up a few cases of soda as well as some snacks and prepared myself for a long night of gaming.

Arriving back at my apartment, I quickly unboxed the game, putting the collectable stuff on my shelves to display them proudly. The Charr figure snarled down at me from his perch atop the bookcase, and I simply grinned. Rushing to my desktop and cracking open a soda, I set to work on installing the game.

I had never been a fan of the Charr as a playable character, and I knew there would be a new race in this installment, but for some reason I chose to be human. I took time making my character, and once I was in Queensdale, I took a deep breath and fully appreciated how much work was put into the game. I quickly snapped a screenshot and uploaded it to my Facebook. Then I dove head first into the game.

I spent the next few weeks, between work and class of course, playing the game. I had made it to level 30 rather quickly. I was surprised at how well I was moving along. There were a few hiccups in the game and servers every once in a while, but other than that nothing too major to report on. 

After about the third week from launch, my aunt passed away suddenly. I put the game down for a while after that. I wasn't in the mood for video games after she passed. She had been young, only in her 40s, in relatively good health. It was a shock to everyone. 

It was three months before I picked the game up again. I don't really know why I did; what could have lead me to do it. But for some reason seeing the copy sitting on the shelf collecting dust struck me as unjust, and I began again.

The first night was normal. My friends and I had created a guild on launch and it was easy to track them. They seemed surprised to see me, but accepted me back nonetheless. We spent the majority of the night questing and leveling. 

There were a few things I noticed as....off? I guess that would be the word. But I dismissed them easily. It had been months since I had played the game, and It had taken ages to update it. So, I simply assumed that the game had a few new additions. 

The first thing I noticed were the monsters. When you killed one, a transparent figure lifted itself from the body, and drifted away. Upon searching the inventory, I found nothing other than maybe a few copper pieces and an item I had never heard of. It was called a Deathbell. I wondered if it was some sort of new crafting item so I checked the stats. There was nothing in the description. Just question marks. There wasn't even anythign indicating if It was soul/account bound. Upon trying to sell it I recieved quite a few errors and eventually gave up. I tried searching for it online and in the Black Lion, but nothing. I simply destroyed it and moved on. I never commented on the transparent figures to my friends. I figured they already knew and were used to it. I prefered to skip the talk of being demoted to n00b status again.

Other than that single occurance, the first night went normally. It wasn't until the second night that I realized the few small things that had seemed off were more than just programming errors or new features.

I logged in the next night, ready for more play. I arrived in Lion's Arch, eager to begin again. But something was strange. The Map Chat was empty, where it would normally be flooding with other users asking about events and other things. But this time, it was empty. And Lion's Arch was devoid of players. Only NPCs stood around. Thinking I had just gotten a weird world, I tried switching. The same thing over and over again. I tried about 10 different ones before finally giving up.

I even tried restarting the game, and that didn't help either.

I don't know what possessed me to keep playing after that, but I pressed on. Maybe it was curiosity. I pulled up my contacts tab and was shocked to see it empty. Everything was empty. My guild tab, my inbox, everything. But I froze as I got to my inventory. The night before I had collected about 15 deathbells before finding out they were worthless and destroying them. Now the slots they had been in had been filled with a new item: ""Wilted Deathbell"". Again, no stats, simply question marks. But I couldn't detroy them. It didn't give me the option. The only option it gave me was to use it, and I decided that might not be a good idea right now.

Finding it a little unnerving to be running around in an MMO devoid of players with and inventory full of wilted flowers, I decided I'd had enough for the night. But my logout button was grayed. I decided it was a bug and simply shut down my computer. I got in bed and tried to sleep. My sleep was restless, and I woke with a start as my room was suddenly filled with the opening screen music for Guild Wars 2, blasting at full volume in my bedroom, echoing off the walls and making me jump from my bed and lunge for the speakers. 

My heart was pounding as I turned the volume down. I'm not sure if it was the being scared awake that was making it nearly pound through my chest, or if it was the fact that I knew for sure that I shut the computer down before I went to bed. I don't have animals, and I live alone. There's no way this could be possible. I quickly ran for the lights because, well, isn't that what you do when you wake up scared? Turn the lights on like it's going to deter some murderer who was intent on killing you anyway?

I fumbled for my phone amongst the heap of things on my desk, and dialed my friend's number. No answer. I tried a few more people before giving up and shutting the computer down once more, removing the power plug from the wall. Feeling much better thinking that would do it, I headed to the kitchen to make myself a drink.

As I returned to my room, I lost grip on the glass in my hand and it tumbled to the floor. The desktop sat there, unplugged, but the screen was lit and the game was on. Over it was a text box, almost like an error message, that simply said, ""PLAY"".

Someone had to be screwing with me, but for some reason I doubted it. My curiosity got the better of me again and I was once more at my computer desk. 

The game was still empty, but this time there were no NPCs either. I had a constant chill running the length of my spine. But I kept playing.

You can only imagine how lonely it is to play a massive community game with no one in it. I searched every area of Tyria that I had discovered. I even went to new places. Nothing. No one. Not even a peep from an NPC. The game was eerily silent.

Unnerved I found my way back to Queensdale, killed a few monsters on my way and headed down to Godlost Swamp. Once there, I arrived where the Shadow Behemoth would spawn and looked around. Nothing but creatures. None of the friendlies were there. Like fireflies or frogs. Just the Shades and such. 

That's when it happened.

I hadn't looked at my chatbox in a while, and I finally looked down. In blue text, like party chat, there was a single word, ""Hello"".

I looked up to remind myself that I wasn't in a party. Cautiously, I typed back. I'll post the full conversation. It didn't last very long.

???: Hello
Me: Hello..?
???: What level?
Me: 40...
???: Good.
Me: Who are you?
-No response-
Me: What happened to all the players?
-No response-
Me: Answer me! 
-No response for about 10 minutes, then this:
???: Pinh ouin vaync eh dra aoac uv taydr. Pinhehk dra fayg ihtan dra taydr pamm vmufan.
After that, no matter how much I tried, I didn't get another response. I didn't know what to make of it. 

That's when I spotted a symbol on my minimap. It was the familiar blue symbol of a downed player. I quickly exited the swamp and made my way to it.

As I neared it, the game fell from day to night in a flash. Genuinely creeped, I moved closer and inpected the body. There was no name when I targeted it, and it didn't give me an option to revive. I couldn't really make out the features, but something wasn't right. The character's animation was twitchy, and it kept flashing. I tried looking for anything I could do with it, then where the revive option would be changed to ""bury"".

I had never seen this option before, so I clicked it and the character disappeared. Where it had been was now a growth of wilted deathbells, just like the ones in my inventory. It gave me an option to harvest, but every time I tried it gave me the same game message in my chat panel: ""Pinhehk dra fayg ihtan dra taydr pamm vmufan.""

Still not knowing what it meant, I shuddered physically and waypointed to another area. That's when I saw a flash of movement off in the distace. It looked like another person. Excited, thinking that I wasn't truly alone in this game, I ran toward it, trailing it and arriving in an area I had never been before. 

Hopelessly lost, I tried to waypoint back to a familiar area, but all the waypoints that I had discovered were now grayed out. I couldn't get back unless I walked, and there were no markers for Asura Gates or anything on my minimap. Not even Vista markers or Point of Interest markers. Just a map, and the arrow that indicated the placement of my character.

I took this moment to take in my surroundings. It was a large forest, a lot like the one in Queensdale. But it was dark and fog had settled near to the earth and hung around the trees in eerie clouds. Shivering, I pressed on, desperate to find my way out.

Keep in mind that so far I have stuck to areas I know. This place, I had no idea where this was. On my map it was just brush strokes, like the way it looks before you discover an area. I found a path through the forest and followed it. 

At the end, there was a large garden, filled to the brim with deathbells. There was a sudden message in my party chat again:

???: You know what to do.

For some reason, I didn't feel the need to answer, and opened my inventory. It was almost like something was guiding my hand as it moved the mouse to the deathbells and clicked ""USE"". 

Almost instantly, my utility and skill bar went empty other than my basic attack. And a huge monster, unlike any I had seen before, sprung forth from the deathbells. It was like the Shadow Behemoth, only it was engulfed in flame. My health was slowly draining, but my instincts were to fight it. 

No matter how many times I tried to attack, it's HP never drained. Eventually, my character was defeated, and went down. There was no way I was going to rally. My health was draining too fast. 

As the last percentage of my health drained, the screen cut to black. It stayed that way for a few long minutes before coming back up and cutting to my character. The cam was zoomed in, and there was a player standing next to me, kneeling beside me. I couldn't waypoint. My character was dead. 

In the chat box, there came one final message: ""Pinhehk dra fayg ihtan dra taydr pamm vmufan.""

Then the character did something, and my body was enveloped in flame. Once the fire had died, where my character's body had been was now a patch of wilted deathbells. The cam froze there. Nothing moving except the other player, whose face turned toward it, and there was an eerie, evil smile on its face before the screen went black for a moment and then exited to my desktop.

I tried to relaunch the game, but the file had been corrupted obviously. I kept getting an error.

I uninstalled it and stepped away from the computer. I didn't know what to do, what to think. My heart was racing. I had NEVER seen guild wars like that. This was not normal. I looked up on my shelf and noticed that the Charr figure was now on the floor, broken into two pieces.

I don't know what possessed me to do it, but the next day, I burned the computer, game, and statue. Everything. I refused to play it anymore.

I tried to tell my friends about it, but none of them believed me. That's why I'm posting this here. Maybe some of you can help me figure out what this means or if someone has had the same experience. 

I never want to play the game again. That much is certain.

I think its an evolved trait of humanity. Our mind blocks out horrible things. Victims of molestation forget, people in car accidents with amnesia. I think this is like that, except our brains are hardwired to just, blank them out, beforehand. While its happening. Nope, mind doesn't see anything. 

They exist in the gaps. Those crevices and holes and nooks that light never gets to. They've always existed there. Before man their worlds were the deep caves, the rotting hollow logs that the witless mouse climbs into, and never comes out. Hate, death, anti-life maybe is better. Things that despise light and life and air. Because of us, there are so many now. So many new places to hide.

That space in the corner of your room between the wall and the dresser. Behind the crack in the foundation in your basement. All the dark places that we've created.

That gap between the elevator door and your floor that we look at but immediately look away from and block out of our mind. You think to yourself, ""I don't want to look down there. I'm really high up."" The thought crosses your mind to bring a flashlight with you one day, shine it down that gap. But you always forget, don't you? You never do it because your brain knows and doesn't want to see. 

One day maybe you're like me. I'm an athiest. I don't believe in those things. Maybe religion, religion was like a stopper that we created. I always thought it was for stupid fools, but I wish I had a God to pray to now. Maybe we created religion so our minds could excuse our obvious ignorance. That way there are things that we don't look at too closely because, evil, you know? And that's ok because Heaven is where I'm going. I think Heaven is a place with no dark places. I want to believe in it now. But I don't think it works when you know. Faith is faith because you don't know. You no longer get to choose to believe in God if you meet a demon first.

One day you do what I do. You look. Not just glance, but lean in REAL close. Put your nose up to that old hole in the wall where the faucet used to be and smell and listen and peer into the darkness that light just drowns in. You look.

And you smell, the damp, moldy, acidic bile. You hear the slimy tentacles rubbing over the rotting leather and the clicking legs of rigid exoskeletons. You see...

Oh god you see.

And then you never stop seeing....or smelling...or hearing...

At the back of your sock drawer a purple spider leg disappears beneath the folded cotton lumps when you open it. That smell drifts out from under your bathroom sink while you listen to something that sounds like a scaly walrus trying to come through the hole in the bottom of your toilet. 

The yellow eye with two blood red pupils looks back at you from behind the grate over the vent in your living room.

And then you wake up one night in a panic and flip the light switch on because you feel a cold rope wrapping around and around your chest...and you taste death in your mouth. And suddenly you have faith. You believe with all your heart that one day soon your going to stand too close to a cracked door to an empty room, or the opening to a storm drain alongside a street, and something will come out of that dark place. Something with pinkish white skin that sizzles in the light that wraps itself around your legs and suddenly your ribs are snapping one by one like toothpicks while blood gushes out of your mouth and you desperately claw at the curb and you feel your legs being melted off by acid and chewed on at the same time. And then your gone from light forever, and the real pain begins.

 A few years back, I was an active member of creepypasta.com's Monolith forums.  This was, I believe, in the 2007-2010 timespan.  In that time, many of the members were using the forum to post their work.  One of the better-written stories, titled Missing: Last Posts, was posted about a month before the site went down, and was never posted to the main site, because of the site's owner going through some issues which lead to the forums being shut down.  

The end result was that all the work posted there was lost, except the few pieces that were deemed good enough to be posted on the main site, which the story in question was not, sadly - either because the owner didn't think it was good enough or because she didn't get around to it before the forums went down.  One way or another, the story was lost, and after remembering it recently, I wanted to share it with the internet again.  This was a problem, given that the story in question no longer existed, so I decided to recreate the story to the best of my ability.  I hope I haven't done too shabby of a job at spooking your bones, Reddit.



On April 4th, 2007, 13 year old Samuel Higgs went missing from his parents' farm in rural Missouri.  The subsequent investigation showed no signs of foul play, and initially, it was believed that Sam had run away from home.  The doors were all securely locked.  No windows had been broken.  The family dogs were undisturbed and unharmed.  In the absence of any evidence, the case was going nowhere.

 After no further developments in the case for almost a month, the case was closed; Samuel Higgs' name vanished, just another entry in the seemingly endless stream of unresolved missing persons cases the US goes through every year.  

However, one month after Sam's disappearance and about two weeks after the case had been officially marked as unresolved, one of Sam's online friends sent his parents an email, which was passed on to the Police by Mrs and Mr. Higgs.  In it, Sam's friend explained that he had come across several posts Sam had made on a forum he frequented, with the first being posted several hours before Sam's parents returned home to find him missing.  The posts were in a thread titled ""What scares you?"" 

In response to a post about dolls, Sam's first post said, 

""lol i know wat u mean.... i am currently home alone on my parents farm and its creepy here! :(  it is always creepy at night, but i have the dogs in the room w. me so i am okay.  but my parents just got this new scarecrow and put it outside and it is really creepy!  it is set up facing the fields but i can see it from the livingroom window and it is really spooky.  i guess it will keep the crows away though!""

About an hour passed.  During this time, Sam made several random, innocuous posts in response to others on the thread, until one user, FireRings221, asked him to describe the scarecrow after noticing his first post, to which Sam replied,

""well its kinda tall i guess, and it has a hat and stuff on.  i think it is from the store but it looks like my mom put our old cloths on it so it would look more scary to the birds.  i can see its face from here and it has a scary face too! its at the head of the driveway looking out over the fields.""

In response, the user posted ""scary! Its coming to get youuu!""  Sam replied, saying, ""ohnoooo!  yeah it is very scary! im glad im inside.  silly scarecrow, u cant get me, ur stuck at the driveway!  

hahah thats funny i thought it was facing the fields.""

Half an hour passed before Sam posted again.  His next post read:

""okay guys im actually kind of creeped out right now!!! the scarecrow is closer to my window i think, i am sure it moved.  when i wasnt looking it moved!  D: the dogs arent scared though so maybe it is just my imagination playing tricks on me! :o""  

Sam's next post seemed to be typed far more quickly than the others had been.  ""ok guys just a update on the evil scarecrow it was really starting to freak me out.  im sure it was at the head of the driveway but now it is on 

the side of it, on the same side as the window.. i am scared but the dogs rnt barking, what should i do guys?""  Sam went on to post a few more times, in response to others in the thread as normal, before falling silent for almost an entire hour.  Sam then uploaded his third-from-last post, which read ""ok something is rlly wrong here, i went to the living room to get a drink becaus the scarecrow didnt move but when i came back it was at the window, right up against it, i dont know what 2 do, and my parents arnt answering the phone, nd i cant find the dogs.  i am going to my room""

Four minutes passed.  

Sam uploaded his second final post.  ""the scarecrow is in the livingroom""

Another two minutes passed. 

Sam uploaded his final post.

""its ifnfr of m i cnt blink icnt lk at the scren its in thr oom pls clal the police my adress is 1800 whetn rd pls hry""


Sam's account does not show any further activity whatsoever after this post.

In the wake of this discovery, the case on Samuel Higgs has been re-opened.  Police now believe that someone was on the premise, deliberately trying to scare Sam.  Unanswered questions, however, include why there were no signs of forced entry to the residence, why the dogs were not disturbed by the intruder, and why Sam described the scarecrow as being in the house with him in his last posts.  Police have since suspected that the culprit may be someone the family knows, who has access to the house keys; however, Mr and Mrs. Higgs have stated that no one but Sam and themselves possessed a copy of the key.  

In addition, Mr. and Mrs. Higgs have stated that they do not recall purchasing a scarecrow.

The Peripheral vision one. You ignore your active imagination and get into the shower, letting the warm water soak you. Through the translucent shower curtain, you notice the door is now open. You think that you must have left it open when you got in. Now slightly paranoid, you get angry at yourself for reading such things while you were alone. As the paranoia begins to reach it's full extent, you start peeking outside the shower at the door, thinking you see something that isn't there. You look to your right, through the curtain to see what you think is a head, tilted horizontally at the bottom of the door. You fling the shower curtain open, to find the empty doorway. This goes on three times, until you think to yourself that if it exists, why doesn't it just come in and get me? You fill yourself with false security. You peek through the doorway one last time, to find an empty doorway, yet again. Thinking of what you previously thought, you begin to not want to turn back around. You're certain that something is inside. But you close your eyes and step back into the now cold shower. You keep your eyes closed, in fear of what might be waiting for you when you open them. You then begin to feel a breeze, lightly brushing your face. You reach for the window to your left, to find it closed. The breeze is heavier now, but it doesn't feel like a breeze anymore. You don't know what it feels like, but you are certain you have felt it before. You then realize what is brushing your face. Breath. You begin to feel terrified. You've seen the movies. Maybe if you stop paying attention to it, it will go away. Right? You keep your eyes closed and back into the wall of the shower. The breeze keeps steady on your face as you back away. The water stopped. No. The water has been turned off. You begin to shrink into the corner of the shower, into what seems to be the only security left.  You start telling yourself to try and open your eyes, that there is nothing there. You open your eyes. You scream. What lies before you is a horrible mix of flesh and blood, with unseeing eyes inches away from your face. You claw at the shower curtain trying to run away.

I my old school I had a door that would open up to a very crude drywall dead end. The funny thing about it is that when I would hold my hand up the cracks in the drywall it felt extremely cold. I knew that there was a janitorial closet on the next aisle over. I just figured that there was an air conditioning unit behind the wall.

In my junior year I got involved in a student employment program. I helped the janitor with certain tasks early in the morning before school started. I was given a key to the janitorial closet. The first time I was in the closet I was being observed by the school janitor. I was was very anxious to see what was on the other side of that false door, but I was disappointed to see that the adjacent wall in the closet was covered with empty toilet paper boxes.

The next day I was allowed to do my work without observation. When I in the process of grabbing the dry mop early that morning I eagerly ""cleaned out the empty boxes from the closet. I was disappointed to find nothing back there but a few small pipes and one large one that looked it was an old fire hose port. It had a large two handed valve on it, and I could not help but turn it. I wasn't surprised that nothing happened, but I was very much amazed at how cold that pipe and valve were.

A few days went by and I thought nothing more of the strange pipes. The first weekend passed. Early the next Monday morning I was the first person at the school besides the janitor who let me in and then promptly left to do his work prepping the gymnasium for the early bird sports kids. I got the mop and got to work myself. I did most of the school floors, but I saw something curious when I got to that false door. There were skid marks and what looked like bloody scratches leading into the door. I turned the knob cautiously and opened it. There was a gaping ragged hole directly in front of the open valve on the large pipe. Cold air flowed out of it and I quickly shut the door. I hesitated about getting my boss, but my adrenaline was pumping and I needed something to do. I quickly cleaned the floor and put the mop away.

Later that day I heard that a middle school kid had gone missing. I just remember being in a stupor for a few days after that. I never felt like I should say anything, and I didn't know what to say if I did. I quit my pre school job and never went in that closet again. The school removed the door the very next weekend, and covered it with fresh new lockers.

Of course, it wasn’t explicitly *his* cat.  It was his roommate’s cat: a black and white stray that he’d adopted a number of years ago.  But since his roommate was away for a few weeks, the cat was Jake’s responsibility.

Each day, he fed her, changed her water, cleaned out her litter box (with far more frequency than his roommate ever did).  Small additions to his daily routine that didn’t actually require a lot of effort.

No, the real effort came at night, when the cat would get lonely.

It happened almost like clockwork.  Around 3am, he’d hear her outside his bedroom door.

*Mee-yow… mee-Yow… mee-YOW…*

This plaintive, mewling cry that would grow more insistent the longer she was ignored.  Occasionally interrupted by the sound of her scratching — the sadly beseeching 

*scritch-scritch-scratch*

of her tiny claws scraping along the bottom edge of his door.

Jake was allergic to cats and preferred to keep his bedroom door closed but whenever her cries became unbearable to listen to, he’d open the door a crack.  Just enough to allow her to nose her way through.  He’d see her eyes glow green in the darkness right before she’d leap up onto his bed and curl up beside him.  This purring lump of teeth and claws and hair.  He’d wake up sneezing or covered in hives and no amount of over-the-counter antihistamines seemed to temper the aftermath, but it was often better than hearing her cry all night.

And so it went like this.  Night after night, week after week.

Until one morning, the cat simply vanished.

Jake opened a can of cat food, assuming the sound would serve as her Pavlovian cue to creep out of hiding, but there was no response.  Shrugging it off, he changed her water, cleaned out her litter box and headed off to work.

When he returned that evening, there was still no sign of her.  Her food and water and litter box remained untouched.  Slightly more alarmed (but not too alarmed because he understood that cats could be complete assholes sometimes) he poked around the small apartment.  There weren’t many places she could hide and yet she still managed to find ways to disappear completely for stretches.

*There was no sign of her, anywhere.*

What would he tell his roommate when he returned?

That night was largely sleepless as he kept waiting to hear her plaintive cries and pleading scratching outside his bedroom door.  But it was quiet all through the night.

The next morning, he changed her food and water and went off to work.  She had to come out eventually, he reasoned.

At work, he searched the internet for advice on “hiding cats”.  He learned that some cats hide when they’re hurt or scared or dying.  (In a few forums, people half-jokingly posited that their cats could open portals to alternate dimensions.)  The larger take-away seemed to be that this is just something that most cats do sometimes.  They disappear and they return when it’s convenient for them.  He tried to put it out of his mind.

When he returned home that night, the cat’s food bowl was empty.  Her water dish was bone dry.  He breathed a sigh of relief and looked around expectantly… but still couldn’t see her anywhere.  He didn’t bother poking around for her.  He’d lost enough sleep over her.  In just a few more days, she’d be his roommate’s problem again.

That night, around 3am, he woke up to that familiar sound…

*Mee-yow… mee-YOW…*

*Scritch-scritch-scratch…*

He tuned it out as he allowed himself to drift off again.  A small act of defiance: refusing to cater to the fickle whims of his roommate’s cat for one measly night.

*Mee-yow…*

*Scritch-scritch-scratch…*

*Meee-yowww…*

*Scritch-scritch-scratch…*

Tonight, her mewling cries were almost like white noise, lulling him to sleep.  He turned away from the door and found a cooler spot on his pillow to lay his head.

**BANG! BANG! BANG!**

The entire door suddenly shuddered against the pounding force of whatever stood on the other side.

Jake was no longer asleep.  

He sat up and stared at his bedroom door.  For a while, it remained silent and he began to wonder if he had just imagin—

**BANG! BANG! BANG!**

He approached the door and opened it… 

... just a crack… 

... and retreated to his bed with grim anticipation.

For a small eternity, nothing happened.

And then the door creaked open… 

… and a pair of nocturnal eyes glowed through the darkness... 

... much larger than the ones he was accustomed to seeing...

The familiar purring sound was replaced with something that sounded more like growling.

The creature stood up on scaly hind-legs and looked down upon him.

The cat had brought something back with it… from whatever unknowable dimension it had visited.

The creature leaped into his bed and curled up beside him.  A heartbeat before long, exotic teeth sank into his throat, Jake imagined it was from Hell.

Nothing about it was special. It was light blue, had curtains in the windows, and cute white chairs on the wrap-around porch. That's what you get when you live in the suburbs. A monotonous existence. However, one thing about this house was different. It had foreclosure papers taped to the door.
 I was always naturally a curious kid. I had stopped snooping in about 5th grade when I found out my mom was cheating on my dad. But I was 16 now. I could handle whatever was in that house. I mean, there was probably just some left behind furniture, maybe a couple spider webs, depending on how long the house had been empty. I turned the knob, and it was unlocked. But when I opened the door, it felt like someone had pulled it from the other side. I instantly got the bad kind of butterflies in my stomach. I kept telling myself to walk away. That the door had obviously been pulled open by something. Yet, I walked in anyway. 
""Hello?!"" I called out. 
""Did someone pull the door open?"" Nothing. 
Okay, so it was probably my imagination. I walked through the downstairs, looking through cupboards and bookshelves. Nothing too interesting. Then I came to a closet. I tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. I pulled and pulled with all the strength I could muster. However, being a 16 year old girl who didn't play any sports, I wasn't particularly strong. The door wouldn't move. I called my best friend, Tom. He told me I needed to just go home and forget about the house, but after I begged he came over. While I was waiting for him to get to the house, I explored the upstairs part of the house. There were five bedrooms. One was obviously the parents room, two were little girls' rooms, and one looked like a teenage boys room. The fifth one, however, was different. There was what looked like a hospital bed. It had straps on it too, to hold someone down. I looked in the closet and there were tons of empty pill bottles and used syringes. I immediately got freaked out and left the room. I was standing in the hallway, collecting myself, when I heard steps downstairs. 
""Tom? Is that you?"" No answer. I thought he was just messing with me. ""Tom, it's not funny. Seriously. I'm not coming down until you say something!"" 
""It's me Jess! Please get down here now!"" He sounded scared, which made me nervous.
 I ran downstairs, and the closet was open, Tom was standing there, staring into it. 
""Tom....what it is?""
 ""I told you to go home."" He sounded different.
 ""Tom, are you okay? You're really freaking me out."" 
He turned to me, and with the sickest grin I'd ever seen, just stared.
 ""I told you not to come here."" 
He was making me really nervous. He kept staring at me, then in one quick motion grabbed me and threw me in the closet. 
""Tom! What the hell is wrong with you?!"" I screamed, while pounding on the door. 
I heard him walk away. I tried to get my eyes to adjust but it was too dark. Then I felt something. Someone was touching me. Running their fingers up and down my arms. Playing with my hair. 
""Who is in here?"" I cried in a desperate hope that this was all a prank. 
No one answered me. Then, I felt my temperature drop. There was a sharp pain in my arms, like someone was drawing blood. Something was crawling on the floor. Millions of somethings. It's like there were bugs all over the floor. I pounded and pounded on the door and it creaked open. I fell out and looked back into the closet. Nothing. It was completely empty. I called Tom's phone, hoping it would be the normal him that picked up. 
""Hey Jess! Sorry I'm not there yet, my car wasn't starting. I'm almost there though!"" 
""Tom, stop. You were here and you threw me into the fucking closet. This isn't funny."" I was livid.
 ""Jess, I haven't been there yet.. What happened?"" He sounded genuinely concerned, and I believed him. 
""I'm running outside, get here as soon as you can!"" I shouted into my phone. 
I ran outside, and something felt off. It was foggy out. A weird thing for being the middle of July. The neighborhood seemed really empty too. It felt like a ghost town. My phone rang. 
""Jess, what happened in there?! There are police everywhere! Someone said they heard screaming and called the police and now they are bringing out a stretcher with a body bag on it! Where are you!? Are you sure I have the right house!? Jess?!?! Answer me! What happened in there?!"" He was totally frantic.
 ""Tom..I'm standing on the sidewalk."" I whispered to the receiver. 
""No Jess. It's a madhouse here. And you definitely aren't standing on the sidewalk. Hold on Jess, stay on the line!"" The phone went quiet. 
Then I heard talking between Tom and what I assume was a police officer. ""We found her strapped to a bed in one of the rooms, with syringes in her arms. There were pill bottles too, someone must have drugged her."" The officer explained. 
""Oh my god... who is it?"" Tom asked. 
""We haven't been able to identify her yet, would you be willing to see if you recognize her? She seems about your age."" The officer asked. 
I didn't hear anything for a while, then crying. Tom was sobbing. 
""That's Jess. My best friend. That's her."" He cried. 
Then my heart dropped. I was dead. Someone killed me. I couldn't remember anything. Just going into the closet.. The phone dropped from my ear, and I could hear Tom screaming. 
""Jess! Are you there Jess?!?! Answer me, please! Jess?!"" It all faded out. I only heard his cries as a background noise. 
I looked around at the barren neighborhood and then collapsed. I was actually dead. This wasn't a bad dream. My heart has officially stopped. I looked up, and it had only gotten darker. I figured I was stuck here, in some weird purgatory like state. I turned around, and there was a dark figure standing in the doorway of the house. I couldn't make out a face, but it nodded at me, and turned away, walking back into the house. I dropped the phone on the sidewalk Tom's screams still echoing out of it, and followed the figure inside.

There was another patient in an isolation cell that when not sedated would constantly scream about how “she needed to get to her grandmothers” and that the staff were as she said “wolves”.

By chance my sister-in law worked there as a nurse, though she never worked while I was in. After I was released I decided to see if she knew what the deal was with the girl. According to her, the girl was found wandering on the outskirts of town in a blood drenched white shawl. With her was a picnic basket that she said were “sweets for her grandmother”. Inside were various human body parts.

When she was questioned about why she was covered in blood she would just repeat “Mother said stay on the path, but I didn't. There was a wolf that I had to kill. But once I did more and more came after me so I ran and hid. They wanted the sweets.” Because of her story the staff had taken to calling her Red.

She was moved to a larger facility a few weeks after I was released. No one at the facility I was in heard any more after for about a year. After which she supposedly kept popping up in other areas with the same story. Apparently there was never enough evidence to hold her for a crime and since she showed no urge to hurt her self or others the hospitals would medicate her until she was lucid and spent some time for observation. While lucid she would deny any knowledge about how she got there or how she came to be covered in blood and have body parts in a basket. The owners of said parts were never identified.

Most recently she has changed her story saying that a woodcutter has been helping her kill more of the wolves.

Though it's only a matter of time. I don't have much longer. It's playing with me. Trying to break me. But I won't be broken so easily. I can't let it win. I still don't know what it wants and I suppose I will never figure out before my time is up. Then again, maybe that's the answer to my question.

For as long as I can remember, I've lived in homes that I had believed to be haunted. I had never believed in ghosts, but some things were just too peculiar to ignore. That odd feeling you get as if someone is walking behind you every time I turn to sleep facing the wall. Various objects falling off of my dressers. This has lasted for years, but hadn't escalated to anything more until two weeks ago.

I had just gotten off of the phone with a friend of mine after having a long conversation about the newest Soul Caliber game. I plugged in my phone to let it charge over night and headed to my bed. I'm used to that sensation of something behind me, so I decided I would attempt to sleep tonight facing the wall, which is oddly the most comfortable position always, and ignore those feelings. I was tired of turning my head to look over my shoulder every two minutes to see an empty room. It knew I was thinking this and wasn't about to let our little game end so easily. Not when it's had such fun terrifying me at night.

I laid down in bed and turned to face the wall. Not even five seconds later, a shadow moved across the wall I was facing. I bolted upright and spun to face the inside of the basement as fast as I could, though nothing was there. My heart was pounding. Why can't I ever just get a good night's sleep? I rolled onto my back so that I could face any part of my room at any moment, my eyes glancing over at the spot of the wall where the shadow ran constantly, though it never returned. But it wasn't done with me for the night. Shuffling came from the other side of the basement. Once again, I bolted upright to find the source of the noise but was met by the sight of a dark corner filled with all of our junk, as we had just recently moved in. I tried my best to ignore it, as I was feeling rather tired. Hopefully if I closed my eyes, I would fall asleep quickly and the night would be over.

That's when I felt it. I can't describe it as a finger or anything else specific, but something definitely touched the blanket right over my foot and dragged downwards. Once again, I flew up from my bed. All I could hear was my own breathing and the dull roar of my fan. No, wait. There's something else. Is that... a voice? A quiet and deep mumbling voice became just barely audible over the white noise of my fan. I jumped out of bed and ran to the fan, turning it off and standing motionless. From upstairs, I heard the TV. My mother had left it on. But the voices coming from the TV didn't match what I had heard. I tried to brush it off as a simple trick caused by the fan and turned it back on, returning to my bed to attempt to sleep again, but the voice came back, this time in a hissing whisper. I couldn't make out a single word it said, but it did not sound happy.

Finally, I was able to fall asleep somehow. But the night did not end there. I dreamt that I was in my own basement, sitting on my bed, A few friends sat around me, but I can't remember who they were. At the same time, all of them got up. They all needed to do something in my house, such as use the bathroom, get a glass of water, ect. They ascended the stairs and I stood at the bottom, staring up at the doorway to the kitchen as they left. I heard all of the doors in the house except the one I was looking at close simultaneously and then was overcome with an overwhelming sense of being alone as the house fell dead silent. It remained silent for a few seconds as I stared up at the doorway, awaiting my friends' return, but I was terrified of this feeling. Suddenly, I heard pounding on the walls. Not from on the walls, but inside of the walls. Screams followed as my friends begged for my help. At this point, I could pinpoint the source of the pounding: My neighbor's condo. 

I charged up the stairs and ran outside, swinging open my neighbor's door. The place looked identical to ours except reversed and entirely empty. As I had opened the door, the banging and screaming ceased abruptly, as if silenced by some external force. I stood in the doorway, peering into the house. I called for them, but no one responded. That sense of loneliness came over me again, but was quickly replaced by something new. Something was in this building. Something that wanted me. It was calling for me in silence and I was compelled to comply. Those impossiby long outstretched arms. That featureless face. It wants me and I have no choice but to comply as it tries to pull me into the shadows.

I bolted up from my bed in a cold sweat, my heart pounding once again. Though the being in my dream made no sound, I couldn't help but associate the mumbling and whispering I had heard earlier that night with the thing. That voice had been calling for me just as that thing had been in my dream. And ever since that night, things haven't been the same. I've constantly had that overwhelming sense of being entirely alone that I had in the dream, even when sitting next to a friend. Though layered under that feeling, I can feel it watching me. I've seen it a couple times. Peering at me from behind trees while walking late at night, staring at me through the windows of every home down the street, waiting in the darkest corner of my basement, and of course, visiting me in my dreams each night. Each time, it gets closer and closer to me. 

Those long arms outstretched, welcoming me. Every time I see it, a feeling of warmth and belonging creeps into me. I can't help but feel at home. I feel terrified and want to flee, but then it lets me know that everything will be ok if I go with it. No one will miss me, it tells me. Even now, it stands behind me, watching over my shoulder as I write my final words so that people may know where I've gone. Its arms outstretched, ready to embrace me. I welcome the embrace, for I am finally home.

I'm finally home.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1eetq8,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1eetq8/home_repost_from_rslender_man/,

Covers over me, head on my pillow, and the light turned off with my door closed so I didn't have to deal with my dog waking me up. 

I awoke to an uncertain sound, almost a soft weeping, like a child, but it sounded wounded and familiar. I opened my eyes and tried to move, but my whole body was paralyzed. Staring straight up at the ceiling I saw the face of my best friend staring down at me, weeping and sobbing uncontrollably as soon as I looked him in the eyes. 

Suddenly all around him were the faces of my friends and loved ones all coming into view, all weeping and screaming, tears flowing from their eyes, turning my rooms floor into a shallow pool. Then one by one all the faces in the ceiling started drooping down, the ceiling literally birthing them all, their sickly pale white bodies splashing in the waters below them.

Slowly they all stand up and start screaming my name in a high pitched chant,their arms flailing at me, heads jerking in a seizure like spasm, necks snapping and cracking with ever turn and twist. They all converge at me, pulling at my sheets, my clothes and lastly my skin. Unable to move I felt them pull off my skin, my blood spurting and splashing on heir bodies and the walls. The room starts shaking and they all pick me up and offer me up to the ceiling. The only thing I can muster is a shriek and the words ""THIS IS ALL JUST A BAD DREAM""

I begin rising up toward the ceiling, which by now is trembling with the whole room. As I rise I see a new face appear, this time encompassing its entirety, and its me. My eyes are black, my mouth hanging open with a hallow chanting booming around the room. I float closer to my mouth as my tongue comes down and wraps around me. The last thing I feel is my body being encased and carried into the gaping hole that was my own mouth, consuming me whole. 

After what seems like an eternity in my mind I open my eyes and find I'm floating on the top of my pool. I thrash about and climb out of the water, gasping for air. My friend runs over to me, throws his towel around my shoulder and says ""Are you okay?"" with a hurried and scared tone. 

As I look into his eyes, I only see the black void staring back at me. As a slow grin creeps across his face, he leans in and whispers into my ear ""Don't worry, this is all just a bad dream right?""",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_185b5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/185b5s/when_the_ceiling_speaks/,

------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know if this will reach out to anyone but I have to write these things down so that I know I'm not *c*razy. My name is James, I'm the father and a husband. I work at a small doctor's office in .. uh... I can't remember. I have *a* wallet here but it's not showing me anything. *N*othing! The only reason I can remember my name is that I have a picture of my daughter in m*y* wallet. She's a beautiful young girl, blond hair like her mother's was but she has my green eyes. The vision of loveliness.

I'm desperate t*o* know where I am. I can't remember much except that I woke *u*p yesterday.. was it yesterday? I can't think to remember. *S*o much has happened it feels like but I've not seen a single soul yet. I woke up in what seemed like a hotel room but it was antiquated, like one of those medieval places you see on T.V. A wooden frame, straw and pine mattress and a feather pillow. The sun had been up for a few hours at least but the shutters kept the  light out. *ee* .

I found this pad of paper and feather quill next to the bed I woke up. I snatched it up, slowly opened the shutters and was blinded by the sun. It was definitely day time. The air smelt of wet dirt and weeds, that kind of smell when you're in like, I don't know a broken down city. That's best way to describe it because.... that's where I am. It's a huge broken down city. As far as I can see there are buildings that are broken down, crumbled and shattered.

It was about then that I realize, oh shit, I'm in a broken down city. Usually when I wake up I have, ya know, coffee and maybe a doughnut but not today. I woke up in a damn broken down necropolis. That's a good word for whatever this is, a necropolis. There weren't even birds around. Keeping my wits... barely, I went for my coat but realized it's a cool comfortable summer day. When I crashed out it was snowing.

Anyway, I explored a bit today. I didn't find *m*uch other than the stock room here is full of provisions whatever happened here the people were able to stock pile dry rations... but the barrel full. Fresh water comes from a small hand well like you would see at a camp-ground where you have to pump for water. Yeah, one of those. I was able to get water and food in me.

I explored a bit. There's literally nothing here but death....well no, whatever was here took away life and left and empty shell. In some of the various buildings I found books in languages I couldn't read, the smell of broken dreams and empty sorrow lingered. I couldn't stay in one place too long. I spent my day exploring and calling out for help but there was no response until about the late afternoon, what three I think.

A neon light above some ruined building sputtered for a good ten seconds and died. There was no label on the place so I looked inside to see a table with some chairs sitting around it and on the north side... wait, how'd I know it was the  north side?! Anyway, it was a stage with a good ole stripper pole on it. I wasn't about to investigate... but now I'm not so sure, I'll ch*e*ck it out tomorrow.

It was around 12AM, and everything in the house was silent, everyone was asleep. However, I was wide awake. The only light in the living room coming from an adjacent table lamp. For some reason, I couldn't fall asleep. About an hour passed but I was still wide awake. I suddenly hear a very faint conversation, with what seemed like radio static. I couldn't make out the words, only simple ones, like Yeah, ahuh, and maybe. I better not be developing Schizophrenia, I told myself. After about an hour, I decided to get up, even though I felt someone was looking at me, someone outside my window or something. The radio in the kitchen was off, and a quick trip to the bathroom verified that noone had their TV on. I continued to go try and lay back down. In the same exact position I was in before, I heard a radio conversation again. This time, there was a short break with a piano playing some normal tune, but seemed creepy at the time. I quickly became more paranoid as the piano continued to play inside my head. I knew I couldn't wake up anybody, they'd just call me crazy. I continued to randomly roam the front part of the house trying to comfort myself, hoping the next time I laid down, the voices would stop. They did! I waited a little bit cautiously before deciding to fall asleep. 

I awoke to a pitch black room. My heart was beating rapidly and I was sweating. The lamp that was on before was now off, I thought maybe a family member had woken up and turned off the lamp. I found myself in sleep paralysis, after a bit of paranoia, and deciding whether or not to get up to go to the bathroom, I found that the voices were back. It was still whispers, but the whispers were louder, as if they were closer. I decided to get up, to escape the voices. However, to my shock and horror, the voices didn't go away. I frantically made my way to the bathroom, both dizzy and petrified. I sat down on the toilet because I was too dizzy to pee standing up. The lights flickered a bit. Then everything went black. Lightning almost instantly struck! I quickly got out of there and knocked on my parents door. No answer. I tried opening the door. It was surprisingly unlocked. Their room was pitch black. I quickly got out my phone to use as a flashlight to find them dead in their bed. The Queen size bed covered in blood. I nearly puked in horror. The voices now louder than ever. I saw something on the wall and turned to it. In blood were the words ""you're next."" The voices seemed to break out into laughter. I sat there petrified for what seemed like forever.

'Muscae Volitantes', they call them. The almost indiscernible dark threads which scatter across your vision when surveying a bright scene. Anonymous pieces of matter trapped in the vitreous humour within the eye, you can't get them out; they are simply an inconvenience to be tolerated.

I awoke violently, confused ; apparently startled by a dream that had already vanished from my conscious mind. Squinting to see in the night a bright neon-red '4:32 AM' glowed in the darkness. Listlessly rising from my bed I stepped heavily across the almost pitch black room to the desk, pushing a lightly glowing button on the computer monitor instantly flooding the vicinity with an artificial white glow. I sat staring vacantly into the blank text document open on my monitor. The faint amber glow of embers from a poorly extinguished cigarette sitting in an ashtray, the only detail my eyes strained to make out of the darkness around me.

A wisp of smoke crept up the screen from the ashtray and over the top out of view. My vision followed the trail from the source up the screen and in my periphery a scattering of ocular detritus followed in its wake. These were the 'Muscae Volitantes', the persistent source of a decidedly minor irritation. A larger than usual spot drifted erratically into view, across my focal point and into my periphery, remaining just visible enough to distract me from my work.

I winced, closed my eyes tightly for a moment to refresh my vision. Reopening my eyes it was evident my attempt had been in vain. The spot was larger now and darker too. I repeated the process, again with the same result. The initially minor spot had increased in size and occupied an uncomfortable proportion of my vision. Quite irritated now I rubbed my eyes vigorously and stared wide-eyed into the monitor. Again it had grown, much more this time, almost dominating my vision in the left eye. It was almost glowing with an intense blackness as I concentrated on it. Somehow it was... beautiful... like closed eye visuals one might experience on LSD, there were endlessly evolving, adjusting shapes, fleeting in and out of existence. Once more I rubbed the eye and opened it again to find it occupying an entire side of my field of vision. Finding myself mesmerised and distracted by the infinite random details I wandered slowly across the apartment, holding the afflicted eye closed. The bathroom flashed into existence with the click of a light switch and I positioned myself in front of the mirror. Gazing into my reflection I slowly opened my left eye once more and was presented with a scene utterly unlike anything I'd ever cared to imagine.

The typical appearance of the bathroom was anything but that; a mass of wispy, black threads arced from my eye around my body and across the room not unlike field lines hugging a magnet. I winked and as the eye closed the scene briefly returned to normal and then back into the wild chaos of before, and though it was hard to tell, it appeared more profound and my vision in the other eye seemed to be affected now, too.

Finding it hard to distinguish between the architecture of the apartment and the swirling apparitions which were enveloping me I eventually stumbled onto the bed, confused and disorientated. My brain was frantically struggling to contextualise the events taking place around me, to no avail. At some point I lost consciousness.

I was surrounded by darkness, floating, somewhere in a place I was completely unfamiliar with. I could not breath or feel though I no longer had any compulsion to do these things. Eventually a red light exploded over me, it flickered, at irregular but fairly frequent intervals, gradually plateauing at a brightness which was tolerable. I gradually drifted to a position where I could see the source of the light.

The killings seemed to become his new hobby, as one or more bodies were being found nightly, always fresh. This killer enjoyed cutting off the faces of his victims and sewing them onto their eviscerated torsos. Often times the face was the only thing that kept the entrails from flowing out of the body. As the murders became more horrific, the killer began to get creative, and obviously had been inspired by Picaso's work, as the bodies seemed to be sewn together with other parts. The police claim the most amount of victims sewn together into one monstrosity has been up to 7, although there are definitely more monsters out there created by the killer, some having body parts where they shoul never be, as well as additional body parts; the work was clearly done by someone with some kind of expertise, as each patch of flesh was sewn together as if it was a simple childhood puzzle. 

The murders are getting closer and closer to me now, they've already taken my parents and sister, as well as many friends I graduated with. I left town and went to a hotel, thinking even if it was me he was after, he wouldn't be able to trace me if I paid cash at the desk, although it was unlikely he had the connections to do so. Nonetheless, the pattern of murders stopped the night I checked into the hotel, but they soon trailed me again, always coming closer to me. 

Feeling that if I had given myself up, many deaths could have been averted, instead of running or hiding, I followed the path the killer would come through to find me at the hotel, hoping that even if I did die, innocent lives coud be spared. I made a crudely-drawn map detailing the city streets, buildings, and the killers path, deciding where I would confront him.

I looked at my map, realizing I must have passed him, as I was a good mile or two from where the last killing was. I went back to the hotel, convinced that his pattern of killings directed towards me were merely coincidence and had nothing to do with me.

As I return to the hotel, I hear a pounding in my head; it was probably just stress induced. I told the manager I would be checking out tommorow, as I was no longer afraid to go back home, feeling confident that his target was never me, and it was just some psycho who didn't know where he would kill next any more than the police thought he would.

I'm quite excited to return home. I haven't even hung up my Picaso painting yet, and I need to clean out the basement, as the stench seems to be getting stonger as each night passes. I don't think I've been getting much sleep either, although it's likely it's just paranoia from a killer being on the loose. I need some sleep anyway, the pounding of my head was getting louder. 

I'm finally home now, but I still want more sleep. The pounding is getting too loud, and I fear I might have schizophrenia as well. I keep hearing unintelligible whispers, even though I am alone. I think I'll feel better soon, some sewing will surely help clear my mind of this whole killer thing.

When I was younger, my mother got help from a friend of hers after my father ran out on us. He was incredibly aggressive and punishments were horrible. Needless to say, me and my sisters didn't like him much and would take any opportunity to push his buttons. It would always end with one of us over his knee. Our work pad off when one day he lost his temper, threw Cheerios all over the kitchen, left, and was never seen again.

So, I guess the real story starts on a snowy winters day a few years later. Our mother was out and my older sister had some friends over. I was really young so I can't remember if there was drinking involved, I think there was because the friend got real sick and had to go to the bathroom.

To get to our bathroom you had to walk down a long door-less hallway. Well, I say door-less but there actually was two doors; the backdoor at the very end, and the bathroom door which sat right next to it on the left wall.

We pointed the friend to the bathroom, and mere seconds after she enter the hallway she came screaming out claiming that there was a guy looking in the backdoor window. She was really sick and about to throw up so my older sister, though terrified, helped her to the bathroom. They returned without incident.

Then my younger sister piped up. She had to use the bathroom but she didn't want to go alone. I was older than her but I was also terrified, so I chickened out. She ended up going alone because my other sisters were too busy.

I still remember her scream as she came running out of the hallway. It was so bad that I swore I would never chicken out like that again.

I only know what she's told me, but I believe her. You'll understand why later.

Here's what she said happened:

Our bathroom was pretty large.There was a large walk in closet, and a shower/bathtub. It also had a small window on the left wall, to high for you to see out of it, unless you were standing or you looked up while sitting on the toilet.

She made it into the bathroom without incident and had sat down to do her business when she decided to look up. There in the window was a mans face looking down at her with a horribly wide grin. His hand was held up in a fist at his chin and between each finger was a knife.

That's when she screamed and ran.

Now, we called the police, but they didn't ind anything. Not even footprints in the snow.

But that's not the creepiest part. The part that really chilled me was that she knew who it was. It was that guy who had helped my mother so many years ago. The guy that we later found out had died only a few months after he'd left us.

My sister was never the same. She couldn't handle smiles anymore. To this day even a normal smile is enough to make her scream.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1j5n10,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j5n10/a_true_and_yet_chilling_story/,

from the various wounds you could inflict with your little knife, like red streams flowing from the Fountain of
Youth? Oh yes, I can see the lust in your eyes. There’s that demon inside of you, just itching to claw his way
out and savour your sins. He’s right behind your eyes; I can see the way he makes them glint even with no light
shining into them.

I’m not afraid.

Why should I be? Death comes for us all, some more painfully than others. It ends the same way though, with
a sack of meat and bones left on the ground. It then begins to rot, to decay, to become the physical epitome of
our place in the grand scheme of things. Nothing. No, I won’t scream, or cry out, or beg for an end as you slice
and prick with your tiny blade.

Instead I’m stuck tied to this chair, when I should be panicking as I stare into the eyes of a madman. I’m
awestruck, fascinated really, by your urge to kill. What drives you, and people like you, to play this type of
game? Indulge me, in my last moments if you will.

Wait, no, don’t do that. You look nervous now. Am I making you nervous with these questions? Of course I
am, I can see you perspire the more we speak. Well, the more I speak really. You’re not doing much talking, are
you? Nope, you’re just standing there looking bewildered. It’s kind of pathetic really, that the hunter, the
murderer, is now poised almost perfectly still. You’re having second thoughts, aren’t you?

Sorry to say it mate, but it’s a bit late for those.

Your demon’s hungry, maybe you’d best feed it before it feeds on you. Oh, I know how that is. Don’t act
bloody surprised, we all have demons to face. Some are bigger and meaner, some are paltry in comparison, ankle
biters at best. But what you have here, it’s beautiful. Oh, you can overcome it, I overcame mine and it’s just the
same. I wanted to kill.

The difference between you and I is that I bottled it in, let it fester and roil in my mind until it started killing
me. That’s what happens when your demons aren’t fed. Do you really want to face that, to wrestle in your mind
and lose sleep and peace of mind and patience, driving away those you love, day in, day out? For the rest of
your days, mind. Or wouldn’t it be easier to simply take this life you’ve trapped?

Hey now, don’t do that, you don’t have to do-.

So you think you can just let me go then? You’ve already come so far, it’d be bad form for me to simply walk
out of here. Your demon won’t have it.

Cut me! Gut me! Wallow in my blood! You play a cruel trick, lad. I’ve been here ninety-seven long years, I’m the 
easiest prey you’ll get. Sate your damned curiosity! Take that knife and make pretty lines, decorate my living
corpse until the life runs out. Get to work!

No, you can’t bloody do it, can you? Have you ever cut or killed anything? I didn’t think so. How did I know?
Well your hand’s twitching something fierce, and though I can see your demon behind your eyes, he’s masked by
your uncertainty.

Your fear is more prominent.

What are you afraid of? Here, stretch out your hand with your knife, I’ll help you. What, you seriously think I
can fight back? A faint breeze can land me on my bloody arse, I doubt I can take your weapon from you if my life
depended on it! Oh, it might? Only if I choose to fight. Which I won’t. So hold it out!

There, see? See how good it felt, to tear flesh? It feels good to enjoy the pressure, the opening, the rush of
destruction. It’s invigorating to slash our meager covering, the flimsy material coating our bodies. Watch my
blood trickle down, drop by drop along my arm. See how the blood drips to my fingertips to fall and splatter the
floor with my essence?

Now you do it, but harder. Deeper. With passion. Give in to that enjoyment. Yesssss! That’s it, oh sweet bliss!

Too long has it been since I felt, too long have I been alone, hiding from life. Cut again, do not stop! You, my
murderer, shall be my last friend. Give me release, and fulfill your need. Stab. Slice. Maim. Kill.

Maybe my death will give you the peace I never had.

For those of you who have an Xbox 360, you may be aware that the Indie Games on the marketplace are generally give and take. From just plain awful Minecraft copies, to games that consist of almost nothing but anime porn, the selection isn't very good. There are a few diamonds in the rough though and they stand out from the competition pretty well. CastleMiner Z is one of those. I have loved the game ever since my friend Ben told me about it. 

One day after getting home from tennis, I decided to turn on my Xbox, kick back, and play some CastleMiner Z. I booted it up from the My Games section and I got the typical update screen. Although I was feeling impatient, I decided to click yes and was brought back to the home screen with a new Active Download. I checked out his big the download was and since my download speed is terrible, it was looking like it was going to take a while. 

The update finished and I started the game up to find that I had lost Creative Mode and all of my worlds that I had. Feeling a bit down, I entered in the code I put in last time to unlock Creative Mode, figuring I might as well make a creative world to get my stuff back easier. After entering the code, the typical message box popped up, reading a message that said, 

""Congratulations! You have unlocked Playground Mode!"" 

I had never heard of this Playground Mode, and I figured they had just renamed Creative Mode in the new update. I started up a game on Normal and began playing.

The first thing in noticed when playing was that the little toolbar at the bottom was dark red instead of the usual black. Thinking it was just a restyling, I continued to walk around, mining some copper. After I got enough copper to make a shovel, I went into my inventory to make one. There was a new description on it that said 

""Used to dig the Green Grave."" 

Now at this point, I was getting a little creeped out, having never heard a Green Grave or any other Grave, but I figured it was a new side quest.

After collecting some materials, I noticed unlike Creative Mode, you do cannot place blocks infinitely. I decided to back out and read the game mode's description. 

""Dig all the graves for a surprise!"" 

It was in the spot where Creative usually was and I figured they scrapped Creative and that's why I lost all my worlds. I went back onto my map, which instead of having the date and time the map was made it just read ""Stone and Copper"" and couldn't be renamed. 

I went looking around the world for a graveyard. Since the map was split into multiple little areas, I figured the graveyard was one of them. After I passed the Vertigo Forest, I saw what looked like a dead grass texture named, ""Sally Soil"" which I thought was a really odd name. After walking about 15 blocks in, an eerie fog set in, and the music that normally played next to the tower at the spawn sounded inverted, and the actual soundtrack itself contained the cries of the multiple mobs in the game, instead of there being mobs in the area. 

After walking for about a minute in the fog, I saw a bunch of blocks that looked like gravestones, which had the different colors from left to right, black, green, orange, yellow, blue. It clicked in my head that it meant the different types of shovels, which were stone, copper, iron, gold, diamond. Having only stone and copper on me, I took out the stone shovel and dug one space below the Black Grave. A mob jumped up from the grave a very slowly creeped it's way towards me. My pistol and knife did not damage it. I hit it once with the stone shovel and it did the normal death animation. It dropped an object called the Black Skull, which didn't have a description and floated around when I held it. 

On the Black Grave, a sign, which has never been in CastleMiner Z before, said ""Sally"" and nothing else. 

I took out my copper shovel and repeated all the previous steps on the Green Grave. I picked up the Green Skull and and a new sign appeared that said ""swings"" and nothing else. 

Not having an iron shovel, I teleported back to the spawn and went looking for iron. 

A few hours later, after having made every type of shovel, I set out for the graveyard again along with my two skulls. I got to the graveyard just fine and the inverted music started playing. I really wanted to see what this reward was. I repeated all the same steps on each and every grave and picked up all the skulls. 

On the Orange Grave, a sign read ""on"" and nothing else. 

On the Yellow Grave, a sign read ""Hell's"" and nothing else. 

On the Blue Grave, a sign read ""Playground"" and nothing else. 

""Sally swings on Hell's Playground."" 

At this point, I was getting really creeped out, but then I remembered there is a Hell biome in the game, so I saved and quit to check out to see if the map had been renamed. It had.

""Skulls Are Heavy""

I figured this to be a hint of what to do with the skulls. I went back into the map and traveled all the way to Hell.

In Hell, the first thing I noticed was that when I held one of the skulls, my controller started vibrating. The further I went in, the more the skulls were shaking. I held nothing for a while because I didn't see any mobs that I needed to fight. 

Soon, a blood red fog started to set in, and I could barely see anything. Instead of the music being inverted, it would play slowed down for 5 seconds and sped up for five seconds, which was even creepier than the graveyard theme. After many minutes of walking, I reached a very bad looking swingset made out of bloodstone blocks. It was about 5 blocks high and had fine different swing out different colors.

I took out the skulls and they didn't make my controller vibrate anymore. I tried placing down the Black Skull on the Black Swing and it was successful. Nothing specifically happened for doing so. I repeated the step for each swing and after the Blue Swing the swingset just burst into Bloodstone blocks. In the rubble, there were two objects that weren't there before:

A Bloodstone Knife.

And a Bloodstone Shovel. 

The knife had a description that said in all caps ""KILL HER"", and the Bloodstone Shovel's description said ""For the New Grave."" I teleported back to the spawn believing that was the end of it. 

When I teleported back, instead of lanterns at the top, there was pulsating bloodstone on top of the tower. All grass was replaced with Sally Soil and there was a sign that said ""You have released her spirit from the grave."" I backed out of the game to see if there was a new map name. 

""A New Grave Awaits.""

When I went back into the game, instead of being at the spawn where I was when I started, I was in the graveyard. All of the graves had new words on them. 

""Sally wants to get revenge.""

I noticed that behind the graves there was a new grave that had popped up. It was made out of Bloodstone, and reluctantly, I dug the space right in front of it. 

Another mob jumped out of ground and this time it went much faster than the other mobs. It's hair was flying all over the place and would not die from the Bloodstone Shovel. I tried the knife and it worked like a charm. Instead of dropping a red skull, it dropped an item called ""Sally's Head"" which was the head of a normal mob. The description read,

""You have made a mistake. Sally is not dead. Sally wants to play a game.""

I walked back to the 5 graves to see if I got a new message.

I did. It said,

""Why don't you turn around?""

I turned around and there was another grave. I put Sally's Head in front of the grave. A message appeared on the screen. 

""I want to have some fun. Let's play hide and seek. Pick a grave. Any grave.""

I turned around to see the message on the graves had changed. It now read,

""Sally's favorite color is red.""

I took the Bloodstone Shovel out and dug another block down the Red Grave. Instead of something popping up, my Xbox turned off automatically.

After an unusually long boot up, I went back to CastleMiner Z and started up the world which was now named,

""Sally's Favorite Color Is Red""

It spawned me next to the tower and everything seemed to be back to normal. My inventory was empty. There was no red toolbar. Thee was no fog or eerie music or Sally Soil. 

I decided to do a little research and found out there was no update for CastleMiner Z and that nobody else had encountered this.

The Businessman crouches by the doorway of a concrete stairwell, fumbling with something below the camera’s frame.  The surveillance camera zooms in but cannot view what’s in his hands from this angle, settling on a tight closeup of his face.

The door bursts open and cracks against his skull.

A surprised shriek from the other side of the door as he stumbles backward, dropping something on the floor.

The Mother emerges.  Startled to see him here.

He smiles awkwardly at her, adjusting his crooked glasses.  Snatches his disposable lighter from the floor, plucks a beat-up pack of cigarettes from his suit jacket.  Offers her one.  She declines, pulling a fresh pack of her own out of her purse.  He lets out a nervous laugh.

“Thought you were going to bust me,” he says.  “You can’t smoke anywhere these days.  Used to be everyone smoked and you could smoke everywhere.  Then they corralled us into smoking sections.  Then they eliminated the ghettos altogether and booted us out onto the streets, like unwanted orphans.  People get really offended if you smoke near them.  Like you’re violating their bodies.”

“I’ve quit,” she says as she takes a long, luxurious drag, keeping her distance from him.  “It’s just been a trying day.”

“If you don’t mind me asking...”

She looks at him.  After a moment of consideration: “Ex-husband.  I don’t mean to be rude, I just don’t want to talk about it right now.”

“Say no more.  Maybe you could help me figure something out.  There’s this stain on the wall here...”

The walls of the stairwell look like they’ve been painted over dozens of times.  Mostly touch-ups.  Ghosts of graffiti tags bleeding through the off-white paint.  The surveillance camera fixes on the spot that the Businessman gestures toward:  a faint, reddish-brown smudge just above a handrail.

“... it looks like a partial-handprint to me.  You can make out a thumb and a forefinger.  I don’t want to say it looks like dry blood but I also can’t escape that feeling.  I’m sure there’s a far more mundane explanation.  What do you think...?”

She looks at the stain.  Disturbed.  Stubs out her smoke.  “I should go.”

“Wait.  Please.  Listen.  I’m trapped in the middle of this never-ending business trip.  Let me buy you a drink.  No offense but you look like you could use a drink.  One harmless drink to settle the nerves.  From one divorcee to another.  We don’t even have to exchange our real names.  Chance meeting in a place like this, you can be whomever you want to be.  You can call me... Charles.”

She scrutinizes him for an extra moment before offering: “Call me Angela.”

● ● ●

The Daughter lies asleep in bed.  Her dog passed out on the floor.  Wisps of sleeping gas dissipate near the bottom edge of the food cart.

Through the drawn, diaphanous window curtains, the shadow of a tree branch.  Trembling.  Gently tap-tap-tapping against the windowpane.

A face suddenly presses against the window.  A distorted shadow through the thin folds of the curtains.  The window opens.  Curtains flap violently inward on the fierce rush of wind.

● ● ●

Little empty booze bottles surround the Older Flight Attendant and the Captain as they tear through the contents of the mini bar, crying with laughter over some lost joke.

The Captain catches his breath.  Reaches for his jacket which has fallen on the floor.

“You really want to know what happened up there, tonight?”

“Have I had enough shots to earn the truth?”

“I don’t know but I’m drunk enough to share.  Ready to see something scary?”

He fishes a flip cam out of his jacket.  Fumbles with the controls for a moment.  The surveillance camera zooms in toward the device and the room-feed freezes--

Flip cam footage suddenly takes us into a commercial airline cockpit.  30,000 feet in the air.  Hours earlier.  The cam shakily frames the windshield and some strange lights that move through the dark sky ahead.  Obscured by distance and cloud cover, it’s difficult to make out the source of the lights, but it doesn’t look or move like a common aircraft.  The Captain’s voice, from behind the cam: “What in the hell is that...?”  Without warning, a bird slams into the windshield just as the entire sky whites out – the flip cam footage breaks into digital static...

The Captain and Flight Attendant sit together on his hotel bed, hunched over the flip cam.  They look like they’ve sobered.

“All the controls froze for a good minute or two.  I was sure we were fixed on a collision path.”

“With what...?”

“Twenty years, I’ve never seen anything like that.  I don’t know what it was.”

“Did you report it?”

“I’d rather report I was drinking.  You don’t report this kind of thing if you want to keep flying.  It’s a career ender.”

● ● ●

The water abruptly shuts off while the Younger Flight Attendant is in the shower, soap in her eyes.  She curses and stumbles out toward the sink...

No water at the faucet, either.

The surveillance camera moves to cover her action.  She grabs a towel and staggers blindly into the bedroom.

“Heather?  Are you there...?”

The figures of several hotel staff members lurk in the corners of the dimly lit bedroom, watching the Younger blindly falter into the center of the room.  From their uniforms, they appear to be lower level maintenance workers.  Faces shrouded in shadow, they each stand crooked... as if their bones had been broken and healed at odd angles.  They stand, watching, observing, stock-still.

She squints through the sting of soap, rubbing her eyes, trying to open them.  “Is someone there...?”

Then all at once, they close in on her—

● ● ●

The Captain and the Older Flight Attendant are making out in his bed, tiny empty bottles spilling onto the floor as they wrestle each other’s clothes off.

A bloodcurdling scream stops them cold.

The Older bolts to her feet.  “That was next door.  Erica...”

● ● ●

The Mother and the Businessman have a drink at the hotel bar.  It is a small, lonely facade of a bar, only large enough to serve three customers a selection of bottom-shelf liquor.  Her body language and proximity make it apparent that she’s warmed up to him marginally.  A nondescript bartender stands by in the shadows.  Observing.

“I’m on the road on business most of the year,” he says.  “I’ve got this large house that isn’t being used much anymore.  I’m going to say something that’s going to sound crazy because we’ve only just met and I’ve had a few drinks but hear me out:  you and your daughter are welcome to stay there until you find a better option.”

A sad smile crosses her face at the offer.  It is a smile that he recognizes as the precursor to a rejection.  He stops her before she can respond: “Don’t say anything.  You don’t have to say anything just yet.  Let me explain how much sense this makes...”

A sound suddenly rises up outside.  Like an airplane landing... but there’s something off about it.  Too much bass.  Strange mechanical rhythms.  The ground trembles.  White light begins to flood in through the windows.

The Mother seems to recognize the light and sound.  She runs off without explanation.  The Businessman runs after her.

● ● ●

Elsewhere.  The camera is zoomed in on The Watcher as he follows the path of the Mother and the Businessman running back to her room, his head moving from screen to screen.

The camera slowly zooms out to reveal the massive bank of monitors spread before him.  Spanning the walls.  Rising to the ceiling.  Dominating this small chamber.  Far more surveillance feeds than would be practical for covering the security of a modest airport hotel.

The Watcher manipulates his controls.  Throughout the hotel, surveillance cameras in empty locations go black.  We are left with a smaller clutch of monitors focused on our active guests.

● ● ●

The Older Flight Attendant and the Captain burst into the adjacent room:

The Younger Flight Attendant has vanished.

They run down the hallways, calling out her name.

The Mother and the Businessman race down the hallway from the elevator bank.  The Older Flight Attendant rushes to them.

“Have you seen my friend, the other flight attendant we were with?  Did you see her leaving with someone?”

The Mother frantically pushes past them, the Businessman following her into her room:

The Daughter has vanished.

She checks the closets.  Bathroom.  Empty.  No sign of the dog, either.

“Becky!?”

The Businessman tries to calm her down.  “She can’t be very far.  You think your ex found you?”  He tries to use his cell phone: it’s dead.

“What?”

He approaches the hotel landline.  “Your ex-husband.  Becky’s father.  You told me you were running from him.”

“I wasn’t entirely truthful with you earlier,” she confesses.  “Her father’s been out of the picture for years.  There’s... someone else that’s been pursuing us for the past few weeks.”

He clicks the landline a few times: no dial tone.  “Who’s been pursuing you?”

“I don’t know... but it’s here.”

“What do you mean by ‘it’...?”

All the lights throughout the hotel suddenly go out.

Surveillance cameras switch to night-vision as everyone begins to panic.

It was this question that prompted the great philosopher Ephialtes to build the Living City. An unparalleled architect, the rulers of every nation vied for the right to host Ephialtes's creation, a sentient settlement whose very essence was imbued with the most potent sorcery. After much deliberation, Ephialtes agreed terms with the Kings of Orr, being granted ten thousand slaves, ten dozen spellbinders, and complete control of Orr's prestigious white granite quarries, from which  he would fashion his masterpiece.

The planning lasted five years; the construction fifty. Ephialtes himself blessed the final stone, his last breath becoming the Living City's first. That night the people or Orr celebrated, honouring the man who had set this new jewel in their nation's crown.

The Living City was a marvel, able to alter it's shape and form to best suit the needs of it's citizens. Houses sprang up overnight as the population swelled. Vast sewer systems grew beneath the streets, eradicating pestilence and disease. Orchards flourished, even in the harshest winter, providing a never-ending supply of heavenly fruits. So contended were the people of the City that not one thought to ask the most obvious question. How was it all possible?

Across the world crops, livestock, even people were vanishing without a trace. The inhabitants of the City had no idea, until exotic strangers began appearing in the streets, lost and confused. The city was no longer providing for the people; it was providing for itself. As rumour took wing across land and sea rival countries mustered their armies to march against Orr. They tore through the beleaguered nation until at last they surrounded the cursed Living City. They slept, and they dreamed of ruin.

Dawn broke across an empty plain. Nothing remained of the Living City, no walls, no homes, not even the roads remains. The place had vanished, never to be seen again.

You might ask how I know all of this, but the truth is I'm not sure. I'm not even sure how I'm talking to you. It must be the City. Some months (or years?) ago I awoke in a charnel house, and walked into the streets of the dead. The orchards lie rotten, the storehouses dust. Only bones remains for those who lived here, and beyond the walls a maddening darkness reclines to the horizon like the death-stare of God. Every few weeks someone new stumbles into the streets, and naturally they turn to me for answers. Soon enough, they make the mistake of trusting me. The meat lasts a good while, even raw, but there's never enough to fill the void. The hunger never ends. For either of us.

I sometimes wonder whether the City is trying to feed me or itself. After all, a city is nothing without a population. I still ponder the question, the one that drove Ephialtes to build this doomed place. Does the city shape the citizen, or the citizen the city? I'm still not sure of the answer.

Perhaps we should discuss it sometime.

I think it was pokemon, I'm not sure, but it's not important either. We were playing for a while, everything was normal. Then I draw a card called ''Suicide event''. In the dream, I was damn sure I had seen some urban legend about this particular card. The description of the card read: *Once this card is drawn, all players must commit suicide and wait for the game to end. Smiling gives the player who drew the card extra points. HavE FUN!*
After I drew the card, I immediately placed it on the table without actually wanting to do so. It wasn't my turn either. Everyone looked at the card for a while, and one by one I saw my friends force themselves to grin and grab the nearest sharp item. They slit their throats. It was down to me and another guy. He looked at me and said ''You will follow us.'' and then proceeded to slit his throat while grinning madly. I was scared at this point, as I thought I would be next. I got up and ran out of the room, but stopped almost immediately after running out the door. I turned around, and walked back to my place, grabbed a pencil and put it through my throat. I was crying and smiling at the same time, and all faded away as I could not breathe. I woke up panting and after calming myself down, I googled ''Card game suicide event'' I didn't find anything, and confirmed that it was just a dream.

Edit: ok, so it was hard to write about this nightmare because there was no consistent flow of events. It was like watching asdf movie, I tried to describe things as clearly as I could remember them.

Ghosts, Aliens, Ghouls whatever you could think of i had a large information bank on anything paranormal, so typically, I  LOVED haunted houses, the ones at fairs, I mean.This isn't about an adandoned house, or asylum.I'd go from fairs to theme parks just for horror houses. Dent Schoolhouse,Knotts scary farm,that kind of thing!

Anyway, I got a call from my friend Jase one day

""Rory, I think theres a new horror house in town, I was going to the bottle shop and theres this place called House Of Terror: The Slaughterhouse, Just thought i should let you know, I know how you're into this stuff ya freak""

I laughed
""Thanks man, whats the adress?""

After clarifying the details i decided i may as well see the place before it leaves town. I drove down to the place,it was across from an old bakery, closed down. I saw the place close by. An old warehouse, Two beefy guys stood at the door and did the usual:

""Welcome to the slaughterhouse...Theres no turning back now,""

""How much is the ride?"" I asked

""Its the final day were here so it's free.""

""Cool! How long have you guys been here?""

""Just over a month now.""

""Ah, I don't come down to this part of town often,I guess thats why I never saw you guys here.""

""Enjoy the ride sir""

I made my way in,It was a typical blood splattered room,as soon as the actors saw me they wailed and screamed as usual,really loudly and quite convincing too. The wounds on their chests looked good, empty eye sockets and gashes here and there,letters carved into their wrists.

slut,whore,fucker in women

fag,cunt,fucker in men

I continued into the next room where a man in a doctors coat and a surgical mask both drenched in blood was forcing a tied up man to eat the intestines of another man beside him who was screaming and moaning. I'll say I was impressed, this was better then some high-paid ones. The sadistic doctor walked up to me and threatened me with a scalpel

I played along and  ran screaming into the next room.I must mention  the warehouse alone was quite creepy. steel walls, steel flooring, ceiling that looked like it couldn't hold itself up. and now with the screams and wails of the actorss I was actually quite scared,enjoying the adrenaline i continued into a room of torture devices with various people tied up and about 4 more 'doctors' ripping their faces away, i'd seen this done quite alot. ripping the skin away from their faces earning a convincing scream and ""OH GOD NO,"" another man was being stabbed in the stomach,although the stomach was already open so they were jabbing at his bare guts.

""These guys are good,they must have a good prosthetic artist."" I mutter to myself.

the actors look at me with pleading eyes and scream for help between the acts of torment by their torturers.

The very last room is totally empty and when i walk through several doctors emerge with scalpels, tranquilisers and drills, chainsaws..the works.

I walk out back into the sun and another beefy guy standing there

""Thanks for coming,but this isn't the end"" Another typical saying.

I get home and look up the place,House Of Terror:Slaughterhouse.

No results.

after several attempts of re wording the same phrase i give up and look up the adress.

A page came up.

TerrorHouseInc.com/udjf93385/slaughterhouse-terror-house88908

I click it and it re directs me to a news report.

Its from a guy named Henry Horton in 1992 in some small town in Nebraska: 

----------------------------------------------------

Henry Horton
2 Maple Ave
Norfolk NE 68701

Catagory: Stalking

I'm a secretary at a typical office job. Every day I come into work I usually have to make a lot of photo copies. We got this fancy copy machine that pretty much does my work for me, so I like to look out the window while I wait. I'm rather lazy so I don't bother lifting the blinds and just prod two apart to take a small peak. The view is pretty nice, its a few stories up but lately when I look I see a stocky fellow in a yellow rain coat standing near the entrance to the parking lot. 

The man is pretty far off, but something about his posture made him seem solemn. Every day the stains on his yellow jacket seemed to grow but every day he just remained there standing like he was waiting for something. 
One day I was having a particularly bad day. My BF broke up with me, it seems he found someone more interesting, someone who had a fancier job that might go places. I felt very down, it felt like my life was meaningless. When I looked out at the window at the strange man in yellow, he slowly started turning his head until it seemed like he looked right at me. He was too far to be sure, but it scared me so I backed away from the window and got some water.
The next day I looked out the window again, and the man in yellow was still there. He seemed like his typical solemn self, I was relieved and started looking elsewhere. I noticed the local calzone place's sign was replaced by ""For Sale"", as were two other shops nearby. I thought the economy must be taking its toll. My eyes wondered a little more until I noticed the man in yellow was staring right at me again. This time I didn't back away right away, instead I tried to figure out if the angle of his gaze really was right at me. I looked at the area near me doing instinctual size and angle estimates and I realized, there is no way he wasn't staring right at me. 
The next day I told my coworker about it. She seemed skeptical. When she looked out the window, she saw him, which made me breath a sigh of relief, at least I wasn't hallucinating. She said he was just staring ahead though. When I walked up to the window and looked out I saw that she was right, but then he slowly turned his head until his eyes once again could be gazing at nothing other than me. How could he even see my slightly exposed face through the blinds? There should be a large amount of glare too. This is impossible I thought, and my coworker said that maybe its just a coincidence. I thought I could test this, what if I try this a few times, no way its just a coincidence if he looks at me every time, but I was too scared. Instead I wanted to believe that it was just a coincidence and left. 

That night I was feeling somewhat lonely so I called a friend over. When I thought I heard her car door I checked out through my first story window. It was hard to see through the glare so I put my hands around my eyes against the window to block out the light. I still couldn't see much, not even the outline of the street. After awhile of squinting and adjusting my hands I realized why I couldn't see the street. I was staring at the face of a man in a yellow hood. I screamed louder than I ever have in my life. I ran to the kitchen got a knife and immediately started calling 911. I thought to hide, if the man came in maybe I could stall until the cops got here. I took my knife and hid in a pile of cloths in my storage room. I was too scared to do anything until the cops came. I heard someone yelling at the door. I wasn't sure if it was the cops or the man so I didn't come out. Eventually they kicked the door open and I started to hear multiple voices and people yelling asking where I was and if I was okay. I mustered up the courage to get out of the closet but I was still scared. What if the men were just impersonating cops. I was desperate to get this over with so eventually I creeped out, and to my relief it really was them. They searched the area and found nothing but some foot prints. I told them I saw this man through the window at work and they assumed it must be a stalker and I should try to figure out who it is.

For a month after that I was just too scared to ever look out a window and I stayed over at relatives and friends houses as much as I could. Eventually though I had to muster up the courage and get over this. So one day I decided to look out my office window again. At first I avoided looking at the area the man in yellow would typically stand. I noticed even more ""For Sale"" signs on local shops, it seemed an extreme amount really whats up with this town lately. Eventually I looked over at THAT spot. I sighed he didn't seem to be there, instead there were a few men about 5, all looking solemn though. Maybe its over I thought. Until I noticed one of them in the back, I could only see his shoulder but it seemed to be yellow. I also noticed they all started to look around, at first in random directions, until eventually one of them started staring at me. I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to move. One by one they all started to look at me. Why me, I thought. Why me of all people, this sad lonely wimpy guy. Then I thought, maybe I'm not the only one but I haven't heard of anyone. Maybe I'm just the first who knows no way to know back then.

After that I made sure to sleep in my parents house. I was thankful for the first time in my life that they lived near by. Well not that near by, still an hour drive. I was weary for people following me as I drove. I looked back several times, and when ever I saw a car I let them pass me. As typical there weren't many cars on the freeway so I'm sure I wasn't followed. Eventually I got to my parents house. I told them what happened over the phone and they seemed worried. I slept in my old bed and it made me feel like a stupid kid for being so scared. Thankfully though my mom always thought we should have a gun just in case, and having one in the house that night made me feel better. Still, I couldn't sleep. The night though was quite, nothing but typical sounds of winds and the occasional car wushing by. I thought what would I do in the long run though. I can't sleep here all the time. Maybe I'll just get my own gun or borrow my parents for a little while. I don't really know how to use it though, but maybe I could learn. I decided that night I was definitely going to a shooting range and learn how to defend my self. The thought gave me just enough courage to become sleepy. I just needed one final reassurance so I looked out the window. I sighed with relief as I noticed no one there. I did see a man a little far off though and I watched him walk down the street. He wasn't wearing yellow, and he passed the house. But then he looked back, right at me. 

I started gasping for air, and I started to notice more men walking towards the house from the distance. I ran to my parents room and started yelling wildly. They got their gun and I curled in their bed like an infant. My mom and dad went to check the window, I heard them shriek and my dad call the cops. They locked all the doors and we stayed in my parents room waiting for the cops. We thought we heard a car pull up, and we were relieved but no one ever made an attempt to enter the house. Hours and hours we stayed in that room scared out of our minds. Eventually the sun rose, and after a few more hours we finally looked out the window.
No one was there but there were hundreds and hundreds of footprints everywhere. We then went to the police station, and that's it, here I am writing this report. I'm sorry for what ever I did to deserve this. Is it because I'm gay do they want to kill me because of it? Is it something else? Are other people having this happen to them? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I heard he went missing a little after this report was filed. So did a few other people with a similar story. There wasn't a pattern in the people who went missing so the trail went cold fast and eventually it stopped happening so the cases were dropped. It was kind of awhile ago so I can't find any more info at least on the internet.

During my early teen years, I lived in a two floor rented house with my mother following my parent’s divorce. The owner of the house was an elderly Russia immigrant who had moved to Canada following the death of her last remaining sibling. She had put the house up for rent for a very cheap price as she had decided she was no longer fit to live alone, and was retiring into a nursing home.

The property we rented was fantastic. It consisted of a hidden driveway, running about 100 meters into the woods. At the end of the drive was the clearing which served as our yard. It wasn’t the largest, yet it was extremely private. The estate was kept in tremendously high conditions, and you could tell that the owner had taken much pride in it. 

There was one place of the yard that stood out though. An eyesore of a garage that unlike the rest of the property, had not been kept in perfect condition. It seemed as if the owner had neglected it for many years. The building in question was about 20x20 feet. It was crudely painted white, with many chippings falling off of it. The main garage door was too tedious to open, so we just parked our car outside. If we wanted to get in, there was a smaller, normal sized door beside the larger one.

We were told that the interior was supposed to have electricity, but if you pulled the switch it barely ever worked. In the off chance that the lights hanging from the ceiling did happen to turn on, you would see that the floor of the building was non-existent, it was just a pile of dirt. At one point it may have been cement, but it had heavily degraded since then.

There were a few tables messily thrown around the perimeter of the inside, but they were so rotten that if you put any pressure on them they would collapse. We didn’t really know what to do with the building, so we mainly use it to store Christmas decorations, and stuff like that.

If you went around to the back of the garage, you would notice that it had been built around a much smaller, much older building. I had always wondered why they hadn’t torn down the older shed when they had built the garage. This small shed was a complete disgrace to the beautifulness that was the rest of the property. The owner had told us to never enter it, in fact, it was padlocked and she had kept the key. 

She had good reason to keep us out, as the building was in horrible condition. The walls were still intact, if you could call it intact. They were covered in fungi, and had become completely rotten. The paint was so chipped that you could barely tell its colour; you could just see the old blackened boards that were once painted over. The roof had long since collapsed, and we could only assume the floor had as well, as it appeared to only be held up by a few cement bricks.

I had always curious about that building.


We had lived there for close to a year before we were told that the owner, who had apparently been suffering through severe depression since the loss of her siblings, had committed suicide in the nursing home. In her note, she had only mentioned us, as we were the only people she knew from around here, even though the only contact we had with her was when we mailed the rent. We had never spoken face to face since the day we had moved in.

She had left the house to us to own. There was no funeral date, therefore no way for us to grieve. She had no known family, so we couldn’t get into contact with them. So we just went on with our lives. We then owned the house, and we were pretty happy.

After that day, our lives just seemed to be getting better and better. In the months following, many amazing things came upon my mother and I. My mother had found a boyfriend, with whom she was very happy with. We managed to get our financial situation under control, and we planned on moving out of our current home and purchasing a house with my mother’s boyfriend closer to town. 

I had just finished packing up my room, and putting everything in boxes. I had spent the entirety of my day cleaning, and I had managed to find tons of garbage. There was only a few remaining days until I would have been moving to the new house, so I was very rushed.
I carried the bags downstairs and took them outside to put them beside the road. While I was returning to the front door, I thought I heard a creak, the sound of rusty metal grinding against itself. I dismissed it as one of those typical outside noises that you hear all the time.

But then there was a bang, the sound of a door slamming shut. That I would not simply dismiss as an outside noise, because, well, my yard was extremely private, and the only doors nearby that I would be able to hear slam were that of my own.

Looking around my yard I didn’t see anything suspicious. But then I heard the creaking again, and out of the corner of my eye I saw movement by the side of the building. I was sure I saw something. Then I clearly could see movement again, accompanied by more creaking, and then a bang.  “Alright, the wind had just blown the door open.” I assured myself. 

I went over to the small rotting shed, the door was flung open. The smell that was emanating from the inside was among the worst I had ever smelled. Ignoring it, I grabbed the door, and started to push it closed, but something caught my eye. There was clearly something shiny on the far side of the shed. I wanted to know what it was, but I remembered the warnings from the owner, one single step inside could cause the whole structure to collapse on top of me.

I guess I was feeling particularly reckless that day, because I stepped inside. The floorboards made a horrible snapping sound, but luckily didn’t collapse. There was an odd liquid covering the floor, which made it even harder to keep my balance, as it was quite slippery. I slowly tiptoed over to the other side, making sure that I didn’t trip and go through the disgusting floor.

Once I reached the other side, I carefully bent down and picked up the object. It was a golden ring with some sort of emblem on it. Engraved along the band was the word ‘Kutuzov’, which, I remembered, was the maiden of the deceased owner of the house. I quickly pieced it together and came to the conclusion that the ring was a Family Ring.
I fiddled around with the ring in between my fingers for a minute, before putting it into my pocket. I was just about to leave, when in my peripheral vision I noticed something. Coming out of the corner of the building closest to the ring, seemed to be a…hand.

I inched closer, and upon further inspection, it was one. Well, the remains of one. Rotten flesh, stretched over the yellowing bones of a human hand. And that’s all it was, just the hand, mummified and broken off from the rest of the body.

My eyes clouded over, and a horrible feeling of nausea fell over me. I suddenly became extremely aware of my surroundings, and I swung my body around to get a better look at the room. That was a bad idea, as my feet cracked the floor beneath me, and I fell face first. When my face touched the floor, I immediately figured out where the smell was coming from. The floor was smeared with dried out feces. 

When I had looked up, I could see the entire contents of the small room I had found myself in. Close to the door was an orange, rusted space heater. Handcuffed, and hanging off the side of it, was a mummified body. The skin was peeling off to reveal the broken bones that were inside. It would’ve been impossible for me to forget this image. The bones of what was once a living, breathing person, had been twisted and distorted, snapped and shattered.  I could see the person’s organs, shrunken, almost prune-like, dangling inside of the ribcage. The body’s left hand looked as if it had been crushed, but I could clearly make out a duplicate of the ring I had in my pocket, on one of its remaining fingers.

The wall beside this body looked as if someone had attempted to smash it, although they never would have been able to, as they were made of what looked like solid concrete. No wonder the building hadn’t collapsed. 

There was the outline of what was once a window, but it had been boarded over. Underneath it were scratch marks from what I would’ve assumed was fingernails, and, sure enough, close by laid the final corpse. This one looked newer. It hadn’t quite mummified yet, and there was still some skin on the body. My guess would have been it was just a little over a year old. But it was missing its eyes. They had been clawed out, and the blood from this was still visible on the floor. Near its hand, laid yet another identical ring.

I was brought out of my trance by the slow sound of creaking, and then a slam, as all light faded out of the room. It was at this point that I remembered that this building had been locked before, and the only person capable of unlocking it, was the owner.

In many cities and towns around the country, there exists a mailbox. It is an otherwise ordinary looking mailbox, but it is very peculiar in two ways: 1. Instead of saying ""Mail"" (or some variation thereof), it has a graffiti-like phrase tagged somewhere on it that says ""Who do YOU love?""; and 2. The mailbox is always located in some abandoned building (whether it's a warehouse or an office building or even a regular residential home).


It was originally believed that this mailbox had some sort of paranormal effect that could be produced simply by dropping an empty envelope in it at midnight. The deliverer had to feel unrequited love for somebody and the envelope had to be addressed to that special somebody (although it's said the envelope definitely had to be empty and addressed to somebody, nobody ever said whether it had to have a return address on it). It was believed that doing this would make that special somebody suddenly realize how much they loved the deliverer. Obviously you can see how this could be used for good and for ill.


However, recently a different story is being told about this mailbox. It is now suggested that the mailbox doesn't make that special somebody fall in love at all. It makes them disappear completely and without a trace.


Every year, many people go missing and are never seen again. Many of them probably had somebody who loved them. Somebody who wanted to be loved back. Somebody who would do anything to see that happen.

I heard everything, all their words from that day.  They were still buzzing around in my head.  “Ugly” “loser” and “freak” stuck with me like crazy glue.  I looked in the mirror.  I didn't see anything but my face at first.  Then I saw them.  My slight imperfections.

My nose had a little bit of bone sticking out at the middle, creating a bump in the middle of it.  I grabbed my pocket knife and the nail file.  I first began slicing at the ridge with my knife, stroking the blade against it.  When my entire nose was covered in blood, I proceeded to file off the rest of the way down to my bone.  I went too far and felt it.  That would never do!  The new indent caused another imperfection.  Since I couldn’t put bone back on, I just scraped the rest of my nose off, straight through until it lay in front of me, blood pooling around it.  I looked back up at the mirror.  My ears were a bit lopsided.

I cut off the section of my ear that was hanging down too far.  I cut it flat instead of rounded to have a new ear lobe.  A flat ear lobe?  Imperfect.  I cut off the rest of my ear.  Now my face was unsymmetrical.  To fix that minor imperfection, all I had to do was remove my other one.  My knife sliced clean through and I was now left with two ears and a nose on my bathroom sink and drying blood over my ear and nose cavities.  My eyes looked wrong.  One was too far from my nose.

I stuck my fingers behind my eyes and pushed as hard as I could.  The right one was the first to come out, landing with a beautiful squishing noise.  My left came out soon after, sounding like pulling a golf ball from thick mud thuck.  It was pure bliss to hear that.

Now I am happy.  I have rid myself of my imperfections.  Although I may not have eyes, I am able to see far more now and you, with two perfectly functional eyes are unable to see the truth.  I lay on the floor of my bathroom now wearing nothing but blood-soaked clothes and a wide grin because now I am perfect.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1iz05h,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iz05h/imperfections/,

The same ones that I’ve always had. Screams and shadows. I was sweating, when I woke up. The sheets were drenched, and my hair was slick. Muscles still tensed from the nightmares, I sat up with much effort, grunting as I swung my legs out over the edge of the bed and planted them on the floor. The darkness around me felt more welcoming than the prospect of returning to my hellish nightmares, so I sat and breathed in the soothing scent of reality.
“I am awake,” I told myself, “and my nightmares aren’t here with me.”
I sat for a long time, letting the solid ground beneath my feet give me comfort from my troubled thoughts. After a silent stillness that seemed to stretch on forever, I glanced back at my sweat-soaked pillow, dreading the thought of returning to that place of terror and darkness that no doubt awaited me in my dreams. Breathing deeply once more, I ran one hand through my hair, cool from the air-conditioning. I stood up slowly and shuffled to the bathroom, hoping to find relief in the bright, fluorescent lighting.
A stinging sensation filled my eyes, when I flipped on the bathroom lights. The pain was welcome because of the light that accompanied it. Light is safety and one more anchor to reality. Looking at myself in the mirror, I sighed at my appearance. Bags had appeared beneath my eyes, and I hadn’t shaved in days. My eyes were streaked with veins of red. I turned on the faucet and let it run, allowing the noise to fill the silent void of my empty apartment. Filling my hands with water, I splashed my face with cold liquid. With my eyes closed, I let the water drip off of my face.
As the water trickled off of my skin, the lights on the other side of my closed eyelids dimmed. My eyes shot open. One of the light bulbs in the bathroom had gone out. The light that had been so comforting to me had been lessened. Slowly I reached for the bulb, and, just as my fingertips met its warm, glassy surface, another bulb went out. Staring intently at the second bulb, my breathing was fast and shallow.
“I’m awake,” I whispered to myself.
Then the screaming started. It came from somewhere in the shadows outside of my bathroom. I turned to face the wall of darkness that surrounded my small bubble of fading light, and all that I could think about were my nightmares. Shrieks in the darkness. My breaths became gasps, as I dropped to the cabinet under my sink, searching for any semblance of light. I prayed for spare light bulbs, a flashlight, anything. All I could pull from the recess of the cabinet was a box of matches. With shaking hands, I tried the first match. It snapped in half, as another light went out, and the terrible screaming grew louder. I was down to three lights over my mirror.
I tried another match, taking care not to break it, but I could not get it to light. Two lights left. Gasping for breath in between attempts to light this match, I never took my eyes away from the shadows outside my bathroom door. The shrieks filled my ears, invading my thoughts, and sucking the oxygen from my lungs. One light left.
“I’m dreaming,” I screamed to myself over the horrible sounds coming from the darkness, “God let me be dreaming.”
The screams were so deafening, drilling into my skull. I slammed the door shut, pressed my back up against the chilled wood, and continued my attempts at light my match with trembling fingers, as the last light bulb began to flicker. Just as that last bulb sparked and went out, I got the match to light, and...everything was quiet. No screaming outside my door, no noises to drive me mad. Nothing made a sound except for my gasping breaths. Slowly I calmed down, slowing my breathing to a normal rate, with my match still in hand.
“I am awake,” I whispered to myself in the darkness.
“Me too,” whispered the shadows, and the match went out.
I woke up in my bed, sunlight streaming in my window. Once again I was drenched in sweat. Sighing to myself, I sat up and examined my surroundings. Nothing was wrong, no terrible presence or screaming shadows. Another deep breath, and I rose from my bed.
“They’re getting worse,” I thought to myself, as I made my way to the bathroom. Once again I let the faucet run before splashing cold water in my face. Leaning over the sink, letting the water run off of my face, I closed my eyes. My calm was returning to me in the light of day. I sighed with relief, breathing in the morning. I opened my eyes, and my breath caught in my chest. There next to the sink were two matches, one broken in half and the other burnt down almost completely.
“I am awake,” I whispered to myself. I couldn’t finish that sentence.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1cjlho,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1cjlho/i_am_awake/,

I thought I would finally write about this since I no longer work at that place. I used to have a second job, just to make ends meet. I worked on contract for a government office doing computer repairs. Typically when they had a problem, I would come in after hours and fix it, sometimes as late as 2-3 AM. 

At first I never noticed anything. I would hear noises and thought it was just the heating system, that was until I heard doors slamming in the middle of the night. Let me give you a small history of my workplace. The place I worked at used to be a Church in which they had in the basement level they did embalming. (I can't confirm the embalming part, it was just hearsay from the employees who worked there.) So they had to deal with a lot of dead people in the basement of the church and hold services for them upstairs. 

At the beginning, I was scared. I didn't want to leave this job because the pay was real good and I needed the money. So I started getting used to it. It took several months and the random door slamming was a usual thing. It didn't happen every time I was there working, but around once every few weeks. It always happened in an area just outside of my view, so I was never able to successfully record it happening. 

One time, around 3 AM, I heard children whispering and giggling in the food storage room in the basement, I was down there at the time replacing a computer that was ruined by a flood. I searched and found no one. That instance only happened once and I was relieved. What ended up truly freaking me out was the dark figure. 

At first, I would see the dark figure at random, he would be in a dark unlit area of the building usually in eyesight of me. (20-30 feet away) It would just turn it's head and stare at me. At full height I estimated it being between 5-6 feet tall.It was a dark shadowy outline that was even darker than the area surrounding it. It was pitch black, but you can see dark pupils that resembled eyes. I could feel it's piercing gaze upon me, and it gave me the shivers. From it's build, it looked like it was wearing a trench coat. 

I tried once to wave a flashlight at it, once light hit, it would vanish. It did not like light. The entity would only show up in dark places in the building, and only on the first floor. I took pictures with my iPhone, but the figure would never appear in them. It also didn't like me. I tried walking to it several times to get a closer look. One time it was in a office staring at me while I was replacing a hard drive in a computer at someone's desk. I started walking closer to it. I got within 6 feet, then the dark figure slammed the door shut in front of it. I opened the door and turned on the lights in the office. It was gone. This has happened a few times and has gotten to become more annoying than scary. It may have been just as annoyed at me as I was with it. 

I tried talking to the figure, I never got a response back, just a cold, dark, piercing stare. I never tried provoking it, I didn't think it would be the smartest thing to do. I worked in this condition for 7 years, until I was laid off from my job there at the end of June 2012. At last! I don't have to deal with that dark figure anymore. I was lucky it wasn't hostile towards me. I just hope the next guy is just as lucky.


Here's a picture of what best represents the dark figure:

""In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house in you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself “The Holder of the End”. Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of someone talking to themselves echo the halls. It is in a language that you will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear.

Should the talking stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud “I’m just passing through, I wish to talk.” If you still hear silence, flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don’t stay at an inn, just keep moving, sleep where your body drops. You will know in the morning if you’ve escaped successfully.

If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a person in the corner, speaking an unknown language, and cradling something. The person will only respond to one question. “What happens when they all come together?”

The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question in horrifying detail. Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, a few end their lives. But most do the worst thing, and look upon the object in the person’s hands. You will want to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror.

-It had to do with a guy riding a bus to work everyday and noticing some weird guy, maybe wearing a brown trench coat and carrying a briefcase. Not sure about the last part, but it feels like that was in it.

-I think he eventually decides to follow the guy, and ends up at the end of the line where all the train cars are.

-Somehow, he ends up traveling through different dimensions, and has to disguise himself because the people look different in every one. I don't think he ever gets home.

-I'm fairly certain that it was written in the form of a letter, or a note, like a cautionary tale kind of thing. Pretty sure his mom is mentioned in the beginning or the end.

The words every father expects to hear. Invariably, at every ten-minute interval, my eight-year-old daughter Cynthia would peel her face from the car window and ask the same question. And dutifully, I would respond, ""Almost, sweetie."" We had been driving for almost two hours (which should give you an idea of how much I'd had to put up with) to drop Cynthia off at her mother's. Lisa and I had been divorced for about three years, and doggedly, she still demanded to see Cynthia for a month every Christmas. Now, Lisa wasn't exactly Mother of the Year material, but hell—I'm no angel myself. I'm thirty-seven, I smoke, and have a nasty penchant for cursing like a sailor. But damnit, I love Cynthia, and it still kills me every time I drop her off for that dreaded month of December.

Needless to say, I was in no hurry to get to Lisa's, and so this year decided to take an old backwoods route. I figured it would be a good chance to show Cynthia the beauty of nature while squeezing out a little bit more time with her before I had to leave her for four and a half weeks. She was so engrossed by the passing scenery that she would only ask the periodic ""Daddy, what's that?!"" or ""Are we there yet?"" before replacing her round little face on the passenger-side window. And I would indulge her every question, explaining ""It's an old grain silo, sweetheart,"" or ""Almost, dear.""

After a while, I flicked on the radio for some quiet background noise, and began to slip into the quiet, meditative trance induced by long-distance driving. However, my calm was soon disturbed by a shriek from Cynthia. Slamming on the brakes instinctively, I brought the car to a lurching halt, looking over at Cynthia. ""What is it? Cynthia, what's wrong!?"" I asked, panicking. My mind raced with all the things that could go wrong—heart attack, pulmonary edema, kidney failure (all of which outlandish, seeing as Cynthia was perfectly healthy); but Cynthia just kept staring out the window, transfixed by whatever was out there.

As I looked past her small, childlike head, I began to see what had elicited the shrill scream.

It was an enormous white birch tree in the middle of a snowy field. Now, aside from the unusually large size of the tree (birches don't usually grow much bigger than a foot in diameter, this one had to be at least four or five), something else struck me as odd about the leaves of the tree. It was a good distance into the field (about thirty yards) and I was still looking from behind Cynthia's head (which was firmly plastered to the window at this point), but I could just barely make out the shape of the leaves themselves. It didn't even register at first, but after looking carefully, I realized that the leaves of the tree weren't leaves at all… they were…shoes. Hundreds of them. Hanging from the branches by the laces, every shape and size imaginable. I slowly opened the door and stepped out to get a closer look. The sheer size of the tree was impressive, and the spread of its branches was unbelievable. By a rough sizing-up, I guessed there to be about six or seven hundred pairs hanging all in all, some from even the smallest branches. I began to walk around the front of the car, unable to take my eyes off the bizarre spectacle before me. Then, without warning, I heard the other door open, and Cynthia shot off toward the tree, giggling with childish laughter.

Now, aside from the fact that this was a field, in the middle of nowhere, it was also the dead of winter. So as Cynthia ran off toward the tree, wearing just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, my first reaction was to go get her coat (Lord knows she wouldn't put it on, even if it was fifty below). I turned around to grab her snow jacket from the car, and when I turned back, coat in hand, to yell at Cynthia to wear it… she was gone.
My eyes searched the snow frantically for her, tracing her footsteps directly to the tree's base. ""Cynthia!"" I called. I heard a girlish giggle in response. ""Cynthia, we don't have time to play games!"" I took a step towards the tree, and as the snow crunched underfoot, I heard her giggle again, unmistakable. ""Cynthia, come here right this instant!"" I shouted, my voice becoming slightly more hoarse. To my immense relief, she revealed herself, dashing out from behind the shoe tree. But there was something off about her, something I couldn't quite put my—

She was barefoot. ""Fine, Daddy, I'm here! Do we have to go? The tree is so warm and nice!""

I grabbed her by the shoulders, shaking her small frame, nearly trembling from fear, ""Cynthia, where are your shoes?""

Nervously, she answered, ""The nice man told me to take them off, Daddy—look, he gave me a pretty necklace!""

My heart sank to the pit of my stomach. Sure enough, there, around my daughter's neck, was a small heart-shaped pendant. I clenched my jaw, grabbed the pendant, and snapped it off.

""Daddy? What's wrong?""

""Cynthia, I need you to get back in the car, and stay there. Now.""

""But Daddy, my sho—""

""NOW, Cynthia. Get in the car, and lock the doors. Don't open them for anyone, until I tell you so, okay?""

""Okay… if you say so…""

Cynthia walked off nervously towards the car, throwing glances back at me over her shoulder. I watched every step she took until she finally got in, and locked the doors. Then I turned to confront this ""nice man"". Whatever sick fuck set up this little sideshow attraction, I wasn't about to allow him to go around luring little kids in with cheap baubles just so he could get his rocks off. I followed Cynthia's tracks straight toward the tree, until it loomed before me, larger than life. It was then that I noticed something about the shoes: they were all children's. Not a single pair larger than a kid's size 7. I shuddered and placed my hand on the tree for support.

To my shock, it was warm to the touch. I peeled back some of the papery bark to get a closer look at what might be causing this phenomenon, and was surprised to see what looked like initials carved in. Now, that wouldn't have been terribly unusual, were it not for the fact that right next to those initials were more. And next to those, even more. As I peeled back more and more of the thin, waxy bark, I discovered dozens of initials carved in, then hundreds. I took a step back. I began to get an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, the twisting, wrenching knot that forms when you know something's wrong. I glanced back up at the shoes, and the knot tightened. I saw Cynthia's sneakers dangling there, like tiny little cadavers, dangling languidly by their laced entrails.

Thoroughly creeped the fuck out at this point, I turned and ran the fuck back to the car, my breath forming heavy clouds in the sharp, cold air. I grabbed my key, unlocked the driver's-side door, got in, and locked it behind me. I turned to Cynthia and asked her, ""Are you okay sweetie? Did anyone hurt you, or touch you?""

""No, Daddy, I'm fine! Mr. Smiles is funny, he makes me laugh. He's got a funny face!""

That knot in my stomach twisted and squeezed, sending icy tendrils of fear creeping up toward my heart. ""Who's Mr. Smiles, Cynthia?""

Cynthia remained wordless as her eyes slid to the backseat. My heart froze solid as I slowly turned my gaze to follow hers. It lounged casually back there, only barely human. Bony talons, clasped neatly together, protruded from underneath the rotting flesh of its fingers. Its ""funny face"" was a mass of decaying skin, stretched tight over its bleached white skull. The corners of its mouth had sloughed away, leaving only a sickening grimace permanently etched beneath its eyeless sockets. The grotesque smile widened, and it reached into a jar at its side, grasping a tiny piece of candy between its decrepit fingers.

""Care for a piece of candy?""

I stared, frozen with terror, as Cynthia's hand reached out and snatched the candy from its clutches, and began unwrapping it. The creature's eyeless gaze seemed to shift to meet my own horrified stare, its disgusting grin widening ever so slightly. I tried to scream, but curiously, found that I couldn't. Funny, I hadn't even noticed his other hand creeping up my neck. A creeping chill entered my veins as his icy talons clutched my throat. Warm blood spilled down my chest as my last breaths wheezed through the freshly torn hole in my neck. Cynthia looked at me curiously, suckling innocently on that piece of candy. Her voice echoed around me as I spiraled down into darkness.

Well, one day, I was putting books in the basement for a future book sale. I used to love this job because I could play music out of my cell phone while I was down there. The basement of the library always gave me the chills but music helped. I started to volunteer more and more to go down to store books so I could listen to my music.

On this particular day, I had my music on shuffle. A song mocking the devil popped up and I had a bad feeling about letting it play, but I did anyway to have a good laugh (and I did). Another song about the devil played soon after. It's called ""Almost Human"" by the Gothic music artist Voltaire. It's a song about the devil talking to Saint Michael (the archangel who banished Satan to walk the earth for eternity). Check it out when you can. Again, I felt uneasy playing this because I am slightly superstitious, but I just shook away the feeling. I like this song and won't pass up a chance to listen to it. I even sang along. Soon after, another Voltaire song played. This time it was ""God Thinks"" (a song about how people are self-righteous and put words into the mouth of God). Well, I had already played two songs about the devil so a song like this wouldn't do any harm either.

I got done shelving downstairs for the night and sent the empty book cart upstairs via the electric dumbwaiter. I shut off the basement light and let the door slowly shut on its own. I didn't expect the door to slam so loud, though, and it made me jump up the rest of the stairs. I was about ready to laugh at myself for being startled as I hit the light switch. But at the exact same moment--the exact same moment I turned the switch down, there was a blood-curdling scream of agony coming from the basement. It was so clear and so loud that I jumped back and my hands shot up to my chest to feel my pounding heart.

I froze there for a moment in the short hallway. The only light came from the red EXIT sign over the door right in front of me next to the stairs. From outside, I heard a firetruck nearby and assumed that it was coming to whatever this person had screamed about. I was ready to be relieved, but the firetruck drove away and the siren faded. Right after that, I heard another scream. It was the same voice as the first (a woman's voice). It screamed, ""No! Please, no!!'"" It was so god damn loud and so god damn clear.

I have always scoffed at people who say that they heard a clear voice saying something typical of a ghost to say like ""Don't!"" or ""Help me!"" or ""Get out!"" I always thought that they just wanted attention for hearing a ghost. I'm not saying that it was a ghost I heard but I know it came from the basement. At first, I thought that it might have been someone in trouble outside the door, but if that had been true than the voice definitely wouldn't have echoed up from the basement.

I haven't been near those stairs since then, but I am nervous because the booksale is coming up and I will soon have to go back down there. I'm not sure if it was the music I had played down there, but something had gotten upset.

Whenever I look down that small hallway now (and these days I rarely do), it's completely dark except for the red light coming from the EXIT sign, and I imagine what could have made that heart-chilling scream.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,black,True,t3_oygon,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/oygon/devil_music/,

He stumbled and crumpled down onto his knees after tripping himself up on his own feet. The images, the viewpoints, all fighting for dominant perspective in his head. It was like watching 1,000 movies, except that instead of a 1,000 different screens, they were all trying to play on the same screen simultaneously. Jack turned and looked down the street. A streetlight at the end of the block suddenly burst into a glittering shower of sparks and glass, and the darkness jumped closer. Just at the periphery of his vision into the darkness(which vision, his eyes, or the mark he just left on the mailbox) he could make out the three figures.

Jack pinched his eyes shut and tried to focus on seeing through the mark behind him. He saw a beautiful naked woman shaving her legs in a shower room. Her firm breasts pressed up against her thigh as she leaned forward(wrong one) His laundry room. A box of tide detergent sat on the corner(wrong one). He saw the arm of the dark figure closest to the mailbox. Through the mark he could see better than his old eyes could. The blackness was more of a deep gray. He focused on the hand and could make out black sharp talons punctuated the end of his three unnaturally long fingers. The figures stopped together, and turned to face the mark. He focused to the left and could just make out himself at the end of the block, kneeling over and clutching his own head. the perspective gave him a moment of vertigo, but he fought the rising dinner in his gut with clenched teeth. He looked back and one of the figures was face to face with his new perspective. A giant eyeball dominated the center of the creatures face, stretching from ear to ear across a face that looked like bleached white leather. The only other feature was a grotesque mouth that snarled at the corners. The creature snarled, revealing rows of jagged, broken, yellowing, needlelike teeth. It raised on finger and forcefully jabbed it into the mark. 

Jack's head exploded with a new torrent of pain. He opened his eyes and saw an older white lady from above. She was entering her PIN into a bank ATM. (not this one). He blinked and saw his hands and legs beneath him. Another light, closer this time, only a few houses down, burst into nothingness. He turned his head and could make out the figures shift closer thirty yards to the edge of the pool of light. They didn't move like normal, they seemed to just...fade out of existence in one place, while reappearing in another. Always in the dark though. ""They hate the light."" Jack thought to himself. It made sense. He couldn't turn off the marks. He didn't think they could blink either. The light probably hurt them. 

Jack turned back and stumbled to his feet. He saw down the hallway of his apartment complex. His neighbor was walking his chocolate lab in from outside (NO). Inside his fish tank, a tetra lazily drifted back and forth in front of him (NO GODDAMMIT). Jack felt his feet slapping the pavement as he stumbled along. He smelled the cool night air, the smell of freshly cut grass from a nearby yard. He tasted his own sweat rolling off his face onto his lips. He blinked and saw a beautiful cityscape from the bridge leading out of town. He felt his foot and ankle bark with sudden pain as it impacted the curb. He felt his finger break as he tried to stop his violent descent. His head clouded as he dully thumped it into the grass on the other side of the sidewalk. He heard a dog barking in the distance and the nearby sound of falling glass and electricity buzzing through exposed wires. He was looking from the back corner of the women's restroom in a local italian restuarant. No one was inside. He shook his head and blinked his eyes rapidly. He tried to stand back up but the throbbing pain in his ankle became a screaming fury when he put weight on it. He felt around in his pants pocket and wrapped his hand around the wax pencil. 

He had found the wax pencil inside the old wooden jewelry box behind the wall of the 18th century colonial his company was remodeling. He remembered how there had been an eye on the outside of the box. He remembered how it felt rubbing his hands over the box, how the eye didn't feel like wax lines, but like skin. He remembered how he stared at the eye for what seemed like hours, swearing that the simple lines that represented an eyeball seemed to be looking back at him. The only thing was was inside was the black wax pencil and a note carved into the lid. ""The eyes bring the watchers.""

Jack didn't understand it then. But months later, he started seeing them through his *marks*. Human like figures in black suits. Human like, but not human. They always seemed to be looking, searching for something...him. Each time he saw them they were always in the dark, and moving closer and closer to where he was. 

Jack felt the damp grass beneath him as he tried to crawl away. A loud crunching noise startled him from above, followed by hot, sharp pieces of glass raining down on him. A moment later he was flipped and pinned on the ground by cold hands that brought burning flame where their claws entered his flesh on his arms and legs. He heard his own sobs and pleading. He heard raspy breathing around him. He felt cold fingers wrap around his own hand and painfully snap his wrist and fingers around the pencil. 

Jack squeezed his eyes shut and saw the inside of Comp City. The overhead lights were off but several large screen televisions were still playing. This view became fuzzy and swirled into a new perspective. He realized that he was again looking into the face of a snarling creature. The giant pupil dialated and he saw a smirk on the corners of the things mouth. It stepped away and he realized that it had drawn him a new mark, this time on the side of the lightpost looking down on his body. He tried to shift his view but couldn't. (Anything else, please) 

He felt the burning cuts, he heard his own screams, he saw.

in front of many people?
I didn't do anything but ran upstairs and cried to your brother.
Do you remember when you told people lies about me?
About my attitude and how terrible mother I was?
I didn't do anything but kept everything inside.
Inside my heart with dark bottomless pit.



You mock me any way you could.
You talked to me like I'm some kind of an animal.
I do have feelings too.
But for you, all I can feel is HATRED.
Never-ending hatred.


Now you asked your parents to live in the house.
I know you're gonna make my life so much harder.
But you don't know how evil I am
and nobody knows anything about my dark past.
I tortured numerous people.
And they used to make my life a living hell before.
But where are they now?
Missing and forgotten.


Now you're here.
Sitting on a chair and tied with your husband.
AH! That pig of yours never ceases to piss me off.
He eats all the food in the fridge and complain about my cooking.
Might as well just feed him dirt.
Now that you're all helpless, 
I'm gonna start my punishment.


I already have dog poop on the plate.
I shoved it into your husband's mouth and he pukes.
He treated me like I'm some kind of a parasite
And I'll make sure that it's not gonna be easy for him.
I feed him the dog poop until nothings left on the plate.
He ate it all and I think he fainted.
What a poor fat man he is.


He's unconscious and its no fun to torture someone who's sleeping.
It's your turn now.
I pick up the pliers on the floor and start to remove your shoes.
I'll start with your pinky toes...


Aaaaaaaaah!


What a wonderful feeling.
I love hearing your sweet voice screaming in agony.
You scream your lungs out but no one can hear you but the 
four corners of this room I bought for these type of situations.
I plucked all your toe nail and they look really lovely.
Its like when you put red nail polish all over them.

I looked for my needles that I used for sewing.
I picked up my thick long needle and pin it into your index finger.
You're crying.

""Please.. please.. I'm really sorry for what we've done!""

""Sorry? You're sorry? Do you know that word?""

""I'll pay you! How much do you need! I promise I won't tell my 
brother about this!""

""HAH! Do you really think I need your fucking money?""

""All these years, you treated me like an idiot. So much for your karma hunny.""



You can't think of what to say.
You just cry and cry until you lose your sanity.
This is fucking funny.
You? Begging at me? Impossible! I thought this day will never come.
But unfortunately, this is gonna be your last day on earth.
So you better enjoy this day.

I really admire how I pin the needles in your fingertips.
wait, I'm not done yet.

""Please please.. Let us go.""


You're crying like a baby now. And I want to cherish every
moment of it. 
I undress you so I can see your body.
Which area should I go for?


""Shall I cut your nipples off?""


""Nooooo! Nooooo please! Nooooo!""


I pick up the scissors from the table near me. 
I really love how you look at me right now.



""Well, I'm sorry. But you've been a pain in the ass for years
and I cannot take it anymore. I cannot take any of your bullying
and your sarcastic smile. I cannot take any of your bullshit!
Not now, not in the future. Its because you'll cease to exist.""


I cut your right nipple off and blood starts to run down 
on your belly. You almost fainted but I manage to keep you awake 
by setting your bloody nipple on fire.



""What are you doing to my wife?""

""Im just playing with your wife. Nothing more.""

You came into the hospital for a necessary surgery, the pain crippling you as your family rushed you into the ER, and the admittance nurse arranging all the things that you need to get well. The pain medication they have you on is dulling any overwhelming sensation you have, the tingling sensation running up and down your arms and legs as you slowly come to. Your movements are hindered, your limbs for the most part unresponsive. You try to look around the room they've placed you in, but even the lolling of your head is beyond you. You purse your lips, and barely manage an inaudible croak as you call out to the nurse. If you weren't incapable, you'd be able to handle things on your own.Even the urgent call of the bathroom.

So, incapable of anything other than rest, you close your eyes, and try to fall asleep again.

Your eyes spring open with the creaking of the private room's window beyond the sheet that blocks your view. The inaudible silence breached by the moaning of the window pane as it slowly opens itself. Slowly you attempt a voice to call out ""Who's there? Hello? What's going on?"", anything to quell this building sense of intrusion. But the medication coursing through your body denies you even that. The sweat begins to seep upon your brow as the possibility of whoever is making their way onto the 4th floor window races through your mind. Is it a homicidal maniac? Is it a thief, looking to make a profit off of the invalid and dying? Is it someone whose pleasure comes in the torment of the infirmed? You wait for an answer while the slowly opening window moves into position. You find that when the window finally stops, it's quickly followed by sounds from midnight activity of the street your room faces. You breathe, deeply relieved at the possibility of a window that's in need of maintenance.

Then you hear a clicking sound coming from the floor.

Your eyes widen at the intruding sound below you. You uselessly struggle against your body, screaming in your head at yourself to get up. Clicking can be heard just beyond the curtain, scampering across the sterile floor. The partition of the curtain in front of your bed billows for a brief second, and settles as the clicking sounds come to a stop. Your eyes are rapt and facing ahead, wordlessly, and almost breathlessly waiting for a sign of movement or life to draw your fears. But the moment doesn't come. Second after laborious second, you stare, feeling the weight of the medication pulling you back down. Your heart begins to settle, as your eyelids slowly begin to float down, and weightily pull you back to slumber. You chastise yourself for thinking that something could happen in the comfort of the hospital. Secure in the feeling of safety, you let yourself fall asleep again.

The bottom of your foot tingles slightly, jostling you slightly, but enough to wake you. You numbly shuffle your feet, attempting to roll to your side, but are completely unable to will yourself to turn. You tighten your eyes, trying to ignore the tingling sensation coursing up and down your foot. The sensation of tingles running up and down your foot is great, but you try to resist. Up and down, up and down, up and... down? A repeating pattern dragging itself across your foot, a sensation you've never felt from medicated numbness before. You don't know what's going on, but this state of ignorance draws you to awareness as you open your eyes and you look past your legs.

A diminutive creature, barely able to peak over the bed, holds your foot in one ruddy brown hand, and is drawing it's other claw against the bottom. Its sickly yellow eyes intently drawn to yours, and smiling with gleaming intent, it slowly pokes and prods your heel, pushing with more and more intensity until you hear a slight popping sound, and then the withdrawing of it's claw as it brings the tip to his nose and sniffs deeply. It shakes it's head, refusing the smell, and wipes something off on the upturned blanket over your legs. Looking back at you, the thing places it's hands on the bed, and scrambles it's way up.

Barely over 3 feet tall, the nude figure stands on your bed, staring down on you as he sizes you up. He sniffs deeply, and getting on hands and knees, begins to sniff repeatedly, moving himself over your body. You want to push it away, to get out of there, to get someone to help you, but your body has become a medicated prison. He hovers over your leg, sniffing around and around, until he stops above your knee. He gently moves the blankets aside, lifts your gown, and caresses above the kneecap. The sensation you would feel is drowned in the numbness of the medication. He draws his claw, looks longingly at your leg, and deftly skewers you. You try to scream, but your throat numbs any words that try to escape, an inaudible gasp of pain and weakness.

You hear the pop as he draws his claw out, and see an immediate drawing of blood from the hole he made. He lifts the blood tipped claw, sniffs once, twice, and enticingly flits his tongue out to sample what's on his claw tip, only to shut his eyes, and enjoy the taste he has found. Acting quickly, he gets on hands and knees, leans over your knee, begins to smell deeply, and begins to lap at your wound. Your mind begins to piece together what is happening. You, in your drug addled state, have been found by this thing that's sampling you, and has decided that you are it's next source of food. You are now it's meal.

You hoarsely try to call for help, attempting every possible prayer and curse in your head to get this thing away from you. It looks at you, yellow eyes with a long, bulbous nose between, no hair whatsoever on its head, watching you attempt to cry out. You try and try to speak, to be more than an inaudible whisper over the sounds of machines and wandering people and gurneys, but you notice that the thing on your bed has begun to mimic you. To mock you. To mirror your helpless state, and pitiable attempts for help. You begin to open your mouth to try once more, but the creature preempts you, by slapping your stomach, sending a dull ache throughout your body, robbing you of breath and effort.

His smile grows wider, proud in the knowledge that you definitely cannot escape. Your eyes grow wider, knowing that this creature can now do with you as he pleases. And that pleasure involves your meat in its' stomach.

He caresses your gut, making sure not to harm an area that's already in pain. He seems to want to cause pain, not just take you apart. He lifts his claw to your chest, placing it at the hem of your gown, and quickly yanks down, slicing as it goes. He separates the pieces, gently scraping across your chest, spiraling around and around, like he's homing in. He crooks an eyebrow, smiles gently, and *POP*! Jabs into your chest. This time, you could feel the pressure of his claw going in. The drugs are starting to wear off!

Your breathing begins to quicken at the thought of all that pain coming back and hitting you at once, but the creature takes no mind of your actions. He pulls out his claw, licks the tip, rolls his eyes back, and zooms in on your right arm. It rushes in, pulling itself tightly against your arm, cradling itself fully. You can actually feel his breath on your shoulder as he nuzzles it, mewling contentedly. He flicks his claw out dramatically, making sure it's directly in front of your face. Gently grabbing your chin, he coerces your head to turn towards your shoulder, as he stares back at you deeply. He grins maniacally, as you smell the charnal odor as he breathes, and see the brownish tinge of his sharpened teeth. You know he's going to enjoy this part, and that you will not.

He forcefully stabs his claw into your shoulder, the popping there, but along with something else you hadn't felt: pain. The drugs are leaving your system, and your reaction elicits an intense, orgasmic response from him. He knows you felt that, and begins a soft cackle as you feel him draw his claw across. The blood begins to pour from your wound, as he twists back and forth, making a widening wound where your arm meets it's socket. You feel his fingers begin to force themselves deeper, as he shoves his claw further in, wrenching back and forth.

The pain is immense, coupled with the intrusion of his hand. You feel the muscles in your arm being stretched, the nerves firing so rapidly that you feel nothing but white hot pain. He spreads his hand, forcing the grievous opening further, surveying all that he has done to you. Your arm is limp, losing all sensation but the nerves in your arm coursing the pain along. He lifts your now useless arm, and begins to crudely saw his claw in the opening. He twists your hand, providing more exposure to your armpit, as the nerve cluster there works overtime at the sensation, until they are sliced, and your arm leaves your sense of connection.

He works his way around the rest of your shoulder, butchering your arm as much as possible. You can feel where the arm connects in the socket, but the rest is now alien to you. He begins to twist and jerk it, seeing how much he must do to excise it entirely from your person. This crude surgery he has done has left an indescribable feeling of violation, but you can see his work is almost finished. Your tears stream down as he places one foot on your chest, grabs his meat with both arms, and begins to pull.

He digs in deep, the weight on your chest leaving a deep sensation of pain as you feel the extending sensation in your shoulder socket. You hear the squeaking and creaking of cartilage as he yanks and pulls on your arm. You want to scream, but your hoarse rasp falls on deaf ears. He tugs on your arm, pulling with his full weight, twisting back and forth.

He tugs, and you feel the joint beginning to slip.

He jerks, and you feel the ball on the edge of the socket.

He leans forward, readjusts his grip on his prize, plants both his feet, and pulls with all his might. You hear the sound of torn cartilage, and see him fall back, his newly won meat in his hands. He wastes no time, smiles at you, almost seeming to offer a prayer for you, before he rolls on your bed, and deftly devouring your hand.

The pain seeps into your body, and as you try to process what has happened, your mind collapses in shock, and you pass out.



The sound of a monitor by your bed greets you as you awaken. You roll your head, trying to put together where you are. Hospital, you think to yourself. You were rushed to the hospital. You see a nurse pass by you, and attempt to sit up. She rushes to you, helping with comfort. She coaches you, saying you were in surgery, and that it was a success. You meekly ask her for some water for your throat, and that you need some time to come to grips with it. You ask how long the surgery was for, which she responds with four hours, while pouring your cup. You see her begin to offer the cup, until she rushes around to the other side to help you drink. You tell her you still have strength to hold a cup, and attempt to grab it. But what you see next shocks you deeply.

You attempted to grab the cup with your right hand, but you no longer have a right arm.

You begin to scream, dazed and afraid of what happened. The nurse grabs onto you, attempting to restrain you, but your violent outburst forces her to cry out for help. More nurses and doctors rush to your bed attempting to restrain you. You hear one doctor ask you to calm down, because you have another surgery scheduled, and that this outburst will only make things worse. You feel the pinch of a hypodermic needle, as one of the nurses injects you with something. You continue to scream that this isn't right, this wasn't what you were in the hospital for.

The weight of the doctors and nurses becomes too much, as your body begins to go under sedation. You attempt to struggle, but the enormity of the situation is too much. You hear a nurse, who is reading your chart, talk about what you meant, as your eyes begin to droop. You hear something about an incident involving necrotizing fasciitis becoming evident, even though your flesh seemed healthy, and that there were more traces of it in your limbs, and the call to excise it immediately.

You try to get their attention, but your mouth begins to go numb. You smell the charnal breath of the creature, and as you look around, you can see the creature from before following the doctor as he makes his rounds, unseen by the other staff and patients in the area. As you begin to succumb to the medicine, you finally are able to motion to the nurse, and leaning in, tell her one thing before passing out.

1362425933.0,18,self.creepypasta,19nljx,The Portrait,Cold_damage,27,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/19nljx/the_portrait/,"One month ago I came across a painting when I was browsing a local second hand store. The painting was out of sight, behind a rather large cupboard. The edge of the frame was peeking from behind the cupboard. I would never have found it, had it not looked so out of place. An elaborate brass frame in the middle of old and ragged furniture and clothes.

The painting itself was eerie, almost scary. It was a woman with unmatching eyes and a nose that was more fitting for a man. It looked off to say the least. I didn't want that thing in my house. The frame was gorgeous though, and as an artist I thought I could use it. I bought it and asked who had painted it. The woman who sold it to me (propably the owner of that place or family of the owner) said that someone had brought it in a couple of days ago, but she wasn't sure who had painted it. The person had just wanted to get rid of it. I don't blame them for getting rid of it, I wouldn't keep that thing around either.

When I got home I took a closer look at the painting. It was titled ''Self Portrait by Natasha Richard Genkin''. First of all, it's unusual for a painting to be titled like this unless it's a well known artist and the painting is in a museum or art gallery. Secondly, that's a weird name for a woman. Richard? I thought it was fake name, or possibly a prank, but who knows for sure. There was also a date marked below the title. ''1979 - 1994''.

After looking at the painting for a while, I made some food and watched some tv. I decided to detach the frame from the canvas on the next day. I had a weird dream that night. I was standing in an empty room with a paintbrush in my hand, looking at someone who was standing in the corner, hidden in shadows. I couldn't see the face, but I was sure it was a woman. She turned her gaze to me and started walking in my direction. As she got closer, more of her figure became visible. As her face became visible, I noticed that she lacked an eye, a nose and both ears. I was now holding a knife, which I instinctively used to attack this abomination. Then I woke up.

During my daily morning rituals (shower, eat, brush teeth...) I noticed that my left ear was getting more and more deaf. It had started during my shower and got gradually worse during the day. The ear was completely deaf by the time I had brushed my teeth. I thought I would go see a doctor after I had dealt with the painting. I took the painting to my workshop (garage) and took one last look at the picture. Her hair was beautiful and long, red like fire. For a moment I was able to look past her unnatural features, and she was quite beautiful. The painting was well made, which contributed to the eerie feeling it gave me. I felt sad for her, and wondered if the real artist looked like the painting. It was titled self portrait after all. I didn't feel like destroying the canvas anymore, I felt bad for even planning to do so. I spared the painting and put her up on the wall of my living room. She looked almost happy, and I felt like I had done the artist a favor for honoring her work, even though I hated it.

I forgot to go to the doctor and just spent the day painting and browsing the internet. The next morning my ear was bleeding. It was kinda numb, too. I figured it had gotten infected or something, and did my morning rituals faster than usual. After eating, I went to see a doctor. I don't have a car, so I had to take a bus. On the buss my other ear started going deaf too, and I was freaking out. Everyone was staring at me. I was scared I might loose hearing entirely, and was constantly looking at my watch and cursing every red traffic light we passed. After a while, someone touched my shoulder to get my attention. I turned around to see a girl with a scared expression standing next to me. I asked what they wanted, barely hearing anything at this point. ''You ea....eed'' she said. I asked her to speak up, and she yelled, even though I barely heard it ''Your ear is bleeding!''. I brought my hand to my left ear. No blood. I looked at her with a frustrated expression. I was already stressed and angry, and now this girl was messign with me? But she shook her head and said ''Other one.'' I touched my right ear to find a river of blood coming from inside. I had a hard time stopping myself from hyperventilating and fainting.

She was kind enough to escort me out of the bus. She gave me a tissue to wipe off the blood, too. I thanked her and said I would be fine, but I wasn't so sure. I was deaf. I made my way to the doctor and sat down in the waiting room. There were just two people there in addition to myself. I waited patiently for about half an hour until it was my turn. I think they called me in more than once, because before the doctor came to escort me into the room, I saw the other two look at me with a strange expression.

The doctor looked into my ears with this strange instrument, and after doing a double take on both of them, he sat down into his chair and wrote something down onto a paper. I caught only a glimpse of it though. Something about bones and tissue mising from inner ear. He then gave me a paper with a time and date marked on it. He wanted me to come by in two days. I tried to ask what was wrong with my ears, but he just shook his head. I went home worried. Will I ever get my hearing back? I got home and saw the painting on the wall. I'm sure that she wasn't smiling like this before. And I'm sure that her hair used to cover her ears. Was I going insane?

I returned the painting to the second hand store on the next day. My ears were still numb and deaf, and my left eye was kinda hazy. When I gave back the painting the woman there handed me a letter along with the money. She said something but I ponted at my ear to tell her I can't hear. She wrote ''It's for you, someone told me to hand it to you if you return that painting.'' on a note. I opened the letter and it was adressed to me indeed. ''Dear ----. Thank you. I'm almost complete now.''",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1362465139.0,,,True,t3_19nljx,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/19nljx/the_portrait/,

 Your mother has just told you to be home at 7:34. It is 7:00 right now.
 You tell your friend that you have to leave and that you will see him tomorrow.
 You turn around and start heading home.
 You walk for a bit thinking of plans for tomorrow. Thinking of hanging out with friends, playing with your pet….seeing that person you like. The wind whips past you hard, leaving cold stinging air in your path.
 You put your hands in your pockets thinking ‘hey its just harmless wind, right?’
 You start to relax. The cold dies down.  
 You pull your hands form your pocket and begin to forget the cold, instead            you start humming the melody of that song that been stuck in your head all week. Then once again the cold leaps from the darkness and drags its long bone chilling finger up and down your body and then suddenly across your face.
 You take your hands and cover up your face with them. 
 You hold your cheeks with the palm of your hands and rub your nose with the tips of your fingers.
 You say ‘that’s it!’ and pull out two gloves from your pockets. You put the left one on first, letting your hand adjust to its new surroundings, then you put on the right one.
 You then proceed to zip up your black sweater, and pull up your hood. Too bad you didn't grab that jacket your mother offered you before you left the house. It could have come in handy right now. Now semi warm you try to focus your mind on more mundane things like, ‘I wonder what’s for supper?’ Or ‘I can’t wait to snuggle up in my bed and fall asleep!’
 You daydream about food and dreams or a while until you notice something….something very eerie.
 You notice how empty it is. You haven seen a car in a few blocks. You haven’t seen one person walking down the street or even in the light of their own homes.
 You start to give excuses like ‘oh its dark out I bet there all inside watching some horror movie, to get in the mood for Halloween this month.’ And then it hits you.
 You haven’t seen one house with a light one since you have started walking. Not one single house.
 You’re not even sure if you even saw a car yet.
 You decide just to brush it off as just a coincidence.
 You start walking again. This time you’re in another friend’s neighborhood just a little bit close to your house. From your point of view the street resembles a long dark hallway. The street is immensely dark. The only street light that is activated is in the middle of the street, sending a cone of orange ambiance to the ground.
 You notice the air is still. Not just still, it is as though the wind and cold that was just lashing your body and face had withered up and died.
 You stop for a second, waiting to be ambushed by the cold. 
 You feel nothing. 
 You take off your right glove, lick your pointer finger and hold out in front of you. There is nothing, nothing at all. It’s like your finger wasn't even wet at all. ‘Its just still, yeah that’s it…th-that time of night, Right?’
 
 You start walking at a brisker pace.
 You’re holding your ear to see if you can hear anything, anything at all.
 You start trying to step on the leaves to make them crunch against the ground.
 You fail even to do that. ‘It was raining earlier th-there just damp, right?’ The only noise you hear is the constant patter of your feet.’ Left, right, left, right, left, right.’  
 You start to feel paranoid.
 You start to feel watched.
 You start to feel the eyeless gaze pierce into the back of your skull.
 You see shadows moving in the corner of your eye.
 You start to walk faster. The never ending patter of your shoes continues as if nothing was happening.
 You now start looking over your shoulder. Hoping, No praying for a sign of familiar life.
 Your mind starts racing ideas in your head. Your paranoia grown bigger and bigger. ‘its nothing, its nothing just my paranoia, right?’  
 You start sweating and shaking. Moving faster and faster until *CRASH!*
 your face lies on the sidewalk.
 Your knees hurt and your hands burn.
 You tripped over a rock.
 You slowly get up. The fear you were just experiencing vanishes. Now the silence is comforting. Well the silence except for the constant patter of your shoes. But wait, you’re not moving.
 You’re completely still. But the patter is still going getting closer and closer.
 You do not think, you sprint as fast as you can. Down hills. Up stairs. Across streets. And before you know it you sprint into your house. To your surprise your family is sitting right there in the living room watching T.V. Your exhale in relief. You say hi. And tell them you just had a quite normal walk home.
 You go to your room. You sit down on your bed. ‘It was just the dark, yeah the dark just got to me that is what it was, right?’....Then you feel it again. That feeling of someone being right there behind you. You dare not turn around.
 You try to get up and run but your paralyzed with fear. You feel its breath up against your neck. Its face is right next to yours. It’s Lips almost touching your ears. “….WRONG!""",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1360438515.0,,,True,t3_187eh9,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/187eh9/this_was_an_assignment_for_school_some_friends/,

I will start by telling you all that has been happening during the past few weeks. I hope this will help someone understand just what is going on here, although it has helped me in no way. 

Two weeks ago my parents (who are both in their mid 50s) decided to go look around at our old house, the one I grew up in. It has been abandoned ever since we moved out about a year ago, but is in pretty decent condition. I will attach a picture taken outside the house.( http://imgur.com/Mn4JBve ) Anyway, I thought I might as well go along and maybe dig around for some stuff we might have forgotten when we left. The house seemed much smaller than when we left, and I got this very ominous feeling from looking at it as we approached. The front door was broken and would not stay open. I left my shoe to keep it open, as I was scared I might get trapped in (I'm claustrophobic and can't stay in closed spaces for a long time). I was going in alone, whle my parents were checking the backyard to see if the swing was still intact (it wasn't). It was dark, damp and overall creepy inside the house. There was a strange smell coming from one of the rooms (I think there were some animals living there) so I decided not to go there. I went upstairs, and to my luck, the stairs didn't fall apart like I thought they would. Upstairs was a bit more light, as the windows hadn't been boarded up like downstairs. I walked down the corridor that led to my old room, and saw movement in the room. I jumped back as I wasn't expecting anyone to be there, but calmed myself fast and proceeded. To my surprise, there was nothing moving in there but a white cloth, swinging in the wind. I laughed a bit for getting scared by something so silly, but thinking back, I swear I saw a person in there.

I pulled on the cloth, as it seemed to be covering something. It revealed a large mirror with a frame of stained gold. There was an inscription at the bottom of the mirror, which said something about watching the new generation (I didn't think anything of it at the time so I can't really remember much of it. It was a sentence of about eight words, written in a strange manner). I looked in the mirror and barely saw anything, as it was stained and cracked. I just stood there for a while, I have not idea what I was doing, but I remember hearing speech coming from behind the mirror. I leaned in to listen to the voice, but jumped back in fear as I heard loud steps from behind me. 

It was my father, who had come inside the house and had managed to somehow sneak up on me. I was amazed, as he is a big guy and the stairs were rather creaky. He laughed and was obviously glad he had managed to scare me. My mother came in the room aswell after a few seconds of lauhging had passed, and immediately spotted the mirror. I saw her looking at it with a weird expression, and asked why we had left it behind (it was very expensive looking). My mother said it's not ours, and that she had never seen it before. I got to thinking, and to be honest, I had never seen it before either. My dad then yelled us to come over to another room (again, he had moved there with no noise made what so ever) and when we got there, his face was glowing. Not literally of course, but almost. He had never looked so happy in his life. In his hand he held some very old pictures, which looked like me in some strange way. There was a picture of a small boy and other pictures of what looked like his father, mother and perhaps an older sister. I had no idea who those people were, but the picture of a small boy seemed to be looking straight at me. ''It's me and my family!'' my father said in and enthusiastic voice. Now that I took another look, the little boy resembled my father.

We left the house, and took the pictures, along with some other stuff that we found in the same room. We put the stuff in a box my dad found the pictures in, and drove off. On the way home, we visited the house of an old friend of my father's. He was and old man, propably almost 90 years old. He had known my dad and my grandfather, and was a dear friend of the family. I didn't really know him, but I know my parents went to visit him on some weekends. My parents talked to him for a while, and told him they were taking the stuff they found. He didn't mind, as it was our belongings anyway, and told us he had been keeping watch over the house (which I thought was a bit weird) in case we ever return. My parents then asked about the mirror in my old room. They apologised about me breaking it in case it was his. I was about to tell everyone it wasn't my doing, but the puzzled look on the old man's face made me freeze. He turned to me and then to my family, and said: ''There is no mirror there. I threw it away myself.'' A long silence followed, and my blood ran cold as I remembered the words I heard from behind the mirror, clearer now than ever. Don't make us go. This is what I had heard, I was sure of it. I was just about to ask the man about it, but my family stood up, and left without saying a word. I watched this play out and followed them, never understanding what had just happened.

I never asked about what had happened during that strange meeting, and frankly, I was afraid to ask. The way they left that old man to his confusion was so cold and unlike my parents. I forgot about it in a mere few days, but then something happened. My father didn't come home one night. We thought he might have gone out drinking (he did that sometimes) but heard nothing from him the next day either. My mother was worried sick, and went to look for him in all the usual places where he goes drinking. Nothing. We asked the police to look for my father, and they promised to find him. I was confused and worried. Why would my father leave like this? A few more days passed, and we got a call from the hospital. He had been found. We rushed over there and saw him in a bed, with all these machines hooked onto him. His face was cut in three places and the wounds were clearly infected. I had a hard time recodnizing him. We were all relieved he was safe now, and didn't even care what had happened. The police officer who had found him like this asked us some questions, and said it had been an animal that attacked him. I don't believe it was an animal, but back then I did.

We went home, my father stayed at the hospital, and all was fairly well. I slept well that night, as I had not slept in two days since his dissapearance. I fell asleep very quickly, and didn't wake up until it was already midday. I woke up feeling rested, and got up. As soon as I did, I heard my mother scream in terror. I dressed up as fast as I could and ran downstairs. She was sitting in a corner, her eyes covered and shaking uncontrollably. When I asked what had happened, she screamed again, this time at me. ''Is this your idea of a joke! What the fuck is wrong with you!?'' I was apalled as I had no idea what was going on, and she never, ever swears at me or father. After a moment of confusion, I saw her pointing at a picture on the table. I went to take a look, and my heart dropped. What I saw caused terror beyond belief. It was the picture of my father as a child, with three cuts on his face, and his eyes black.

EDIT2: I was planning on this just being a horror like story not like the traditional creepypasta content :/ so my bad...


The definition of Insanity

Ignore? [ I was told by a friend, a while back, that the definition of insanity, is doing the same, God damn thing, over and over. Expecting things to change. That’s pretty crazy. When he told me I thought he was lying to me. So I took care of him. But you know what, later on I discovered that Einstein had said that quote, along with a character from a videogame I played, and it started to make sense. Everywhere I looked, everything I saw , was everybody. Every single person. Doing the exact. Same thing. Again and again, expecting that every single time, it was going to be different. Well not anymore, I’m a wild card. And this game was about to get a whole lot different. ]

My name is Victor Manson. I am 17 years old and have done some bad things. Nobody knows, nobody must find out. They haven’t found out for years...they can’t find out. 

They won’t.

The scenes keep playing again and again in my head, like a scratched record, it never stops...I think I’m going bad again. The first time I went bad I was thirteen. 

It was really bad.
     
 My parents took me to see a psychiatrist, I hated him. He never cared about why I went bad, he was paid to care, I didn’t need his pity. I can take care of myself. 

Or so I keep telling myself, I need help but I can’t seem to grasp onto anyone who tries. I know I need them, but something won’t let me. Something dark inside me, a storm, destroying all that comes in it’s path, which in my case was anybody who was brave enough to care about me.

But I don’t need them, they don’t know what it’s like. To be angry. Bitter. Confused.

 A murderer. 

They don’t understand the thrill of having the power to have someone’s life in your hands, someone so innocent...so pure. It makes you feel almost...Godlike. 
The psychiatrist, Chris, he was a fighter. I liked that. He struggled to get away from me, he tried to scream for help. Poor man, it was a shame he decided to have my session in the evening, when he’s all alone in that USELESS OFFICE OF HIS. He had nowhere to run, I can picture it all clearly like it was yesterday. He struggled for breath as my hands tightened around his throat, I could feel his racing pulse slowly fade away. He was dying. I started to salivate at that point, all the excitement numbed my senses, I was oblivious to the world around me, the sounds of the sirens outside were muffled away, my vision started to blacken on the edges. I could taste blood.


It was horrible, I felt like I had just woken up from a nightmare, my hands were covered in blood and Chris was on the floor, his face a deep shade of blue, a chunk of flesh missing from his cheek. I was shaking uncontrollably as I looked around for a place to hide his body. My eye caught the balcony, it opened to the sea being directly below us. It was risky but I couldn’t take a chance. He was heavy,and as i dragged him, the blood from his wound started to smear all across the carpet, making it’s original white colour stained with deep crimson stains. 
I pushed him out the balcony and staggered back and fell on the floor. I was out of breath, I quickly ran out of the room and got to the bathroom and washed my self off. What was I becoming? 

Of course this wasn’t the last time I killed, It’s said that once you get a taste of human flesh you can’t get enough. The sweet, tender flesh gets you crawling back for more, and the thrill of hunting your meat, as nature intended. Nothing makes me feel more alive. 
My next victim was so much more fun, she had a lot more kick to her. Her name was Samantha, she went to my school. She had beautiful, delicious looking thighs. The thought of them make me lick my lips with anticipation. She was tall, very pretty and had long, beautiful hair that flowed off her shoulder like a waterfall. She was a keeper. I remember that I almost immediately had an attraction to her, I loved her. So much that I wanted her to be mine. Nobody elses. But she wouldn’t go for a guy like me, strange, twisted...insane. 
Master would be much happier to have her.

No. I’m not insane, I’m just troubled that’s all, I had a rough childhood. But Samantha really was pretty, I regret doing what I did to her. What kind of monster kills the girl he loves. For petty thrill. I don’t even remember killing her, It’s always a blur when I kill. Like trying to remember a dream, but alas, you don’t wake up from dreams with a dead body in your hand and your clothes soaked in blood...

Blood, sweet juicy blood. I can taste her now. Master appreciated her. She certainly was of impeccable taste. Master told me he was pleased with me, he was happy with my gift. I approached her at lunch time, collor done out.
Girls like that. 
I smiled at her and said “Hey Sam, what’s a beautiful girl like you doing in a school like this?”
“Oh stop with the cliches Victor, you’re so cheesy sometimes.” She said grinning
“So what’s been going on with you?” I asked while scanning her body, I hoped that she felt uncomfortable.
“Oh not much, I’ve just had English and that Majed kid was being such a prick, how about you Vic? Been up to any psycho mischief lately? “ She said, her gorgeous blue eyes glistening in the light. 
They looked delicious.
“Funny, hey listen I know you’ve got a politics exam coming up, how about you come round to my place and I can help you revise?” I told her, with other intentions at mind.

“Sure, I’m not sure where you live though, and what time?” she asked.
“I’ll take you there, how about you meet me outside after school’s over?” I said
“Sounds great! See you then Vic.” She said whilst walking away, her hair shining in the light.
I smiled at the thought that this was probably the last time she was going to walk these corridors, I wondered if she had argued with her mother before she left, I hoped so. I want her mother to cry with guilt when she finds out about her daughter. I smiled at that thought as I slid my hand into my pocket and held my knife tightly. 

It won’t be long now Master, no no, not long at all.

I met with her after school, I led her to where she thought was the way to my home, oh how wrong she was. Silly girl, doesn’t she know she should never follow someone towards the woods. We were silent as we were walking, I could hear her soft breath as she breathed. So gentle, so... fulfilling. 
We reached the woods, I was surprised she didn’t ask any questions about where we were going. I could feel Master’s eyes burning into the back of my head, he was going to be proud of me.
“Vic, I know you don’t live this way why did you bring me here?” She asked, anxiously looking around, her arms wrapped around herself trying to keep herself warm.
“I want to show you something.” I said coldly 
“And what might that be?” She asked, a slight shake was in her voice. I liked that.
“Close your eyes.” I commanded.
“But-” 
“Close them.” I said as I put my hand into my pocket to take out the knife.
The time has come, Master is waiting. Yes Master will reward me...he will reward US.
“I want you to count to twenty, slowly now don’t rush.” I said as I pulled out the knife, running my finger against the blade, drawing blood from my finger and putting it in my mouth. 
The metallic taste urged me on. 
As she counted I began walking towards her, I could smell her skin. I could see the strokes of her lipstick. My eyes widened as I pulled back the knife, my mouth streched out into a smile.

“Thirteen, Twel- , Vic this is getting silly I’m opening my eyes” She said as she began to open her eyes. 

Too late. 

I felt the warm blood run down my hands, I could feel the cool air escape her lungs through the now gaping hole in her throat. Blood began to come out her mouth, I kissed her, drinking in the warm blood as I did. I started stabbing her again and again. She started to hit me and tried running away.
There’s no running from Master, he sees all. He KNOWS ALL.
“Aw sam, you look so cute when you try to run away.” I laughed, as I walked towards her, “There’s nowhere to go silly, oh my look you’re bleeding, let me help you with that.” 
I grabbed her by her hair and dragged her deeper into the woods.
“LET ME GO, LET ME GO YOU MONSTER!” She screamed
I chuckled and kept dragging her.
 Master was going to be very pleased with me, I knew he would allow me to feast on her body for what I did for him. 
I took her to the stone in the opening of the woods, It was rumoured that this was the place where druids used to perform rituals to gain the following of the dark lord, It was always a ritual that intrigued me. Master always told me that If I did well, he would help me. He said he could stop the ringing inside my head, he promised he would make me better again, he said I would be free.
I looked up at the sky, the moon was full and the planets aligned. This was a special night.
It was time. 
I lay her on the stone and cut a pentagram into her stomach, she was crying.
“Hush honey, you’re going to be fine.” I whispered into her eyes as I licked the salty tears off her face. I began the chant.







“ In nominee de nostre Satanas: Lucifere Excelsis! 
Introibo ad alatare Satanas
Ad Satanas, qui laetificat gloria meam.
Palas aron onzinomas Geheamel cla orlay
Baske bano tudan donas Berec he pantaras tay”

“In the name of our Satan; the golorious Lucifer!
I will go up to the altar of Satan
To Satan, the giver of youth and glory.
In the name of Satan, ruler of Earth, the King of the world, the Chief of the Serfs, I command the forces of darkness to bestow their infernal power upon us. Save us, Lord Satan, from the treacherous and the violent. Oh Satan, Spirit of the Earth, God of Liberty, open wide the gates of Hell and come forth from the abyss by these names”

As I finished the chant, I stabbed cut open her chest and pulled out her heart, It was still beating in my hand. I looked up and closed my eyes. Samathas heart in one hand, the bloody knife in the other. I breathed in and smelt the blood from her body. 

A new age was to to begin. 
A new order.
A new leader.
A storm is coming, and those who are unwilling to bow down to Master will not be taken lightly.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1359144716.0,,,True,t3_1792zp,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1792zp/the_definition_of_insanity/,
1358517771.0,18,self.creepypasta,16te0m,Claire's House on the Lake,YoungerThanYouThink,22,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16te0m/claires_house_on_the_lake/,"(author's note: cut me some slack, I'm just a kid.)

        It was a quiet autumn Saturday in the small town of Crizville with not many people about.  The air was chilly, and that may have been what kept so many people in bed.  Ayden considered it a perfect day for a walk, for he loved the cold weather.  With the road to himself he set out, heading to the corner of his street.
	When he reached the corner, he made a right and walked to the small lake that was a few blocks away from his own home.  As he made his way along, a cool breeze began to blow.  Ayden smiled to himself and breathed in deeply.  The sun shone brightly, cutting through the chill of the air.  What a perfect day, he thought.
By this time he had reached the lake, and hadn’t seen anyone but his own shadow out and about.  Perhaps that was why he jumped when a quiet voice said, “Hello.”
	Ayden spun around suddenly, surprised by the unexpected sound.  When he turned, he saw a young, pale girl standing a little ways behind him.
	“Hi,” he responded.
	“Very beautiful out today, isn’t it?” She smiled, her voice so very soft.
	“Yes it is.  Fall is my favorite time of year,” He said, smiling back at the sweet little girl. “What’s your name?”
	“Claire,” She answered, still smiling the most adorable smile. “And yours?”
	“Ayden,” He told her.  She smiled again and made her way over to where he stood.  When she reached him, she sat down in the grass beside him and stared out over the lake.  Ayden sat down as well, and they stayed quiet for a moment.
	“Have you ever been inside that house?” Claire broke the silence and pointed to the old off-white house to their left.
	Ayden was confused. “No, I haven’t.  Why do you ask?”
	She didn’t answer him, but simply smiled, stood, pulled him to his feet, and led him to the front door.  When they reached it, she opened the door with ease.  Ayden thought it strange, for as long as he had lived here, this house had been locked and uninhabited.  But, he dismissed the thought and allowed Claire to lead him up the stairs.
	“It’s very interesting, what I am about to show you,” She said, her shy voice slightly higher pitched with excitement.  As she dragged him along, Ayden could not help but notice how extremely cold her hand was.
	They reached the room at the end of the hall on the second floor.  It was then the thought hit him.
	“Wait…” Ayden said hesitantly, backing up. “Are we allowed to be in here?”
	Claire turned to look at him with what seemed like an angry glint in her eyes.  It made him jump; the intensity of the stare, though it lasted for only a moment, was very, very strong.   But she quickly masked it with another sweet smile.
	“Oh, yes, yes.  I’ve been here countless times.  No need to worry,” She said calmly.  He relaxed.  Something about her voice erased all his doubt, and she seemed so very easy to trust.
	When she opened the door and they both stepped inside, Ayden’s eyes widened in wonder.
	“Whoa…” he breathed.  The room was filled with sculptures, beautiful sculptures.  Sculptures and statues of people.
	“I know all of them,” Claire said.
	“What do you mean?” Ayden asked, being pulled back to reality from his wonder with the realistic artistic skill.
	“The people that the sculptures represent.  I know all of them.  They are friends,” She answered.
	“Wow,” He said. “That’s a lot of people.” There must have been fifty or seventy people.  Suddenly growing tired, he yawned into his hand and plodded across the room.
	As Ayden approached one of the statues to get a better look, he noticed there was some writing carved on the base of it.
	“William Heatherbranch, 1953-2001,” He read aloud.  His brow furrowed in confusion.  “Wait… this is a grave stone.  But Claire, I thought you said you were friends with these people.  You couldn’t have been older than two or three when this man died.”
	Ayden turned around for an explanation, but Claire was nowhere to be seen.  His heart rate quickened.
	“Claire?  Claire?!” He called, running towards the door.  But once he reached it, it slammed in his face.  He gasped and tried to open it.  As he rattled the handle, he discovered it was locked.
	“Claire!  What’s happening? Where did you go? Wha-“but he was cut off by the sound of a man laughing.  Fear rose up in his chest.
	“Who is that?  Did you kill her?  Let me out!  Let me out!” He cried.  Another wave of exhaustion passed over him, and he became dizzy.  He stumbled back from the door and put both hands to his head.  The room spun for a moment, and he thought he caught a glimpse of Claire, but no, it was just another statue.  Then he blacked out.
	When Ayden regained conciseness, it had grown dark out.  Then he heard someone calling his name.
	“Ayden!  If you can hear me, answer please!” Someone called.  Ayden was still frozen in shock, his body racked and drenched in sweat.
	“If you can’t speak, throw or bang something!” the person called again.  Ayden managed to pull himself together.
	“I’m here!  Here!” He called back.
	“Where?  Keep talking, I’m coming,” The person responded.
	“Up on the second floor!  The last room at the end of the hall!”  Ayden shouted.
	“Ok!  I’m coming!” The person called again.
	Soon the door rattled.  “Will the door open?” The person asked, now in a normal voice.
	“No, it’s locked and I can’t unlock it,” Ayden replied.
	“Ok, back up!  I am breaking in!”  Ayden didn’t need to be told twice, and he quickly scrambled backwards.
	The door fell in to reveal a cop standing in its frame.
	“Are you all right?” the officer asked, walking into the room and helping Ayden to his feet.
	“Just a bit shaken,” he said.
	“Someone called the station a couple hours ago, saying something about screaming coming from around the lake, and then your parents reported you had been gone longer than expected.  What happened, son?”
	Ayden didn’t answer, he just thought for a moment.  What had happened?  All he could remember was the door slamming, locking him into the room of grave statues.  Then, seeing Claire right before he passed out… but wait, it hadn’t been Claire, it had been a statue.  He sucked in a quick breath and turn to look at the statue behind him.  Yes, it was Claire.   But, these were gravestones, and he had spoken to her only today.
	Then, he remembered.
	He was the only child who lived in this neighborhood.

Rumors say that these suicides and illness only occurred after the children playing the game reached Lavender Town, whose theme music had extremely high frequencies, that studies showed that only children and young teens can hear, since their ears are not fully developed.

Due to the Lavender Tone, at least two-hundred children supposedly committed suicide, and many more developed illnesses and afflictions. The children who committed suicide usually did so by hanging or jumping from heights. Those who did not acted irrationally complained of severe headaches after listening to Lavender Town's theme.

Although Lavender Town now sounds differently depending on the game, this mass hysteria was caused by the first Pokemon game released. After the Lavender Tone incident, the programmers had fixed Lavender Town's theme music to be at a lower frequency, and since children were no longer affected by it.

One video appeared in 2010 using a ""special software"" to analyze the audio of Lavender Town's music. When

played, the software created images of the Unown near the end of the audio. This raised a controversy, since the Unown didn't appear until the Generation 2 games: Silver, Gold, and Crystal. The Unown translate to LEAVE NOW,
There is also the said Beta Version of Lavender Town.
It is said that the Beta Version of Pocket Monsters was released to some kids to test the games. [This is the video of the Beta Version of Lavender Town:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFQRxqHXMb0&amp;feature=player_embedded)

So, I recall a story a few years back, when I would spend summers with my grandma (guessing because my parents didn't want much to do with me). Anyway, my grandma wasn't the most stable person, she wasn't crazy, but she had a different house every time I would go visit. I didn't think much of it as a child, it was always a new location to spend summer.

On the last summer trip to her house, she lived in a fairly older neighborhood, the houses were very dated, with large spaces inbetween them, and only 1/3 of the houses actually had someone in them.

I remember what started the problems now, there was a pretty large forest behind the house (it could have been 5 trees, I was a kid, who knows), and I would go out into those trees every day and go adventuring like my favorite video game and cartoon heroes.

During one of my adventures, I heard my granmda scream, a nasty scream like she was injured. I ran back to the house to check on her. (it took me a good 20 minutes, I'm not sure how I heard the scream or if it was hers).

My grandma never drank anything, but a drunken psychotic whore is the only way I can describe how she was acting. She was on the kitchen floor, having fallen off a step ladder, and one of her legs was clearly broken. I called the police, but what scared me was how she was acting. Kind of flailing around muttering ""I can't run away, the Lungrow can find me I can't run away the Lungrow can find me""

After she had been taken to the ER, I stayed there with her. It was a small town, they knew my grandma though she hadn't been there long, and having known her, knew me and let me stay in there with her. I remember getting a pizza that night. She was coherent now, and I remember asking her ""Grandma, what's a Lungrow?""

She choked on her pizza, spit it out and smiled at me. She went into a story, of how when she was a kid, her and her neighbor friends used to tease this older disabled gentlemen by the name of Henry Lungrow, and it turned into a story for them that ""The Lungrow"" as they called him, would kill and eat any children that ever spoke to him.

About a week afterwards, we got to return home. Grandma stayed in the house cooking a large meal, and I went back out into the woods to play some more, but I wasn't alone. There was a guy there, who looked as though he had down's syndrome, and having know one or two people with it in my class at school, I knew it wasn't particularly a threat. I said hello and skirted around, because I was still uneasy with the idea of someone else in my forest (the neighborhood had plenty of houses that were occupied, there was no way I was the only one to brave these woods).

Having played a while, I thought it time to return home. The food was still cooking, but I couldn't find my grandma, anywhere. I checked the kitchen and main living room, the cellar, but I couldn't find her anywhere. I was scared, I called the police again, and they came over, and searched the house. I hadn't looked in her upstairs bedroom, I don't know why I didn't, it just didn't occur to me. After doing the search upstairs, the police officer (same guy who helped when my grandma broke her leg) just came down and said ""You need to come with me, do you know your parent's number?""

I didn't, but it was by the phone, there were called, I my mom and dad came out to pick me up, and spent a lot of time with the police. I was again playing in the backyard, but not the forest, and I saw that same guy, just staring at me. It unnerved me more than I can say, and I went back inside, not telling anyone. 

We stayed for another week or so, and then had a funeral for grandma, I hadn't known she had died, and it hit me hard. No on bothered to tell me. The casket was closed, it was a quiet, quick funeral, my parents said their goodbyes to family members, and we went back home. As I've grown, I understand the horror my grandma must have felt, because that guy who I saw in the forest has been following me. He looks different every time, but I know it's him, something in the vibe I get from him. I don't know if my grandma's childhood stories were true, I don't know how she died, and I don't know if I'm overreacting and casting aside people with Downs as monsters. But what I do know is that I feel like running, hiding and moving so he can't find me, that guy.

I love writing, hoping to be a author in the future and I'd love to have feedback on this. Hope you like it:) 


It's been three nights, maybe four. To be honest I lost track awhile ago. The seconds turned to minutes, minutes to hours, hours to days. I forgot how long I've been running, was it safe yet? I risked a second to catch my breath. Listening closely I heard the faint whisper. That strangely familiar whisper. 

I was a regular cheerful teenager until my life plunged into darkness. No. Regular isn't the word. My parents fought, often blood was drawn. This aside I managed to stay sane. This would a have been a nearly impossible task if it weren't for my brother. Sane. Keeping me sane. But now I wonder, is anyone truly sane? He was the tiny light in this dark life I have grown to call my own, but once he vanished, so did my bleak hope of happiness.

It was three in the morning when a loud crash filled the silent house. Usually this wouldn't have surprised me, not the worst I've awoken to living with my parents. What made my blood go cold was the sudden realization that the crash came from my brother's room. I ran for his door and swung it open. His room was a disaster, most of my brother's possessions were destroyed. Blood soaked the floor and some of the walls. A trail of blood lead to the broken window, I looked outside and almost screamed.
A creature about 7 and a half feet tall, eyes completely black, long claws and covered in hair. It seemed to smile at me before running away at supernatural speed. I fainted.

Three months later I was in school, always gloomy and depressed. Unfortunately this caught the attention of the 3 biggest assholes in school. While they snuck up on me and began to beat the crap out of me I couldn't have cared less, they could have killed me and it wouldn't have made a difference. Inside, I died three months ago. As they kicked me and punched I just took it. Maybe if they killed me I'd Finally be at peace. Maybe. Then ""it"" came back. It shoved its outstretched claw through the first guy, jerked it out, spun around and slit the second's throat. The third tried to run, the creature pounced on him, grabbed him by the hair and ripped his head off. I got up and ran.

It chased me to the edge of town, to the forest. I have been hiding and trying to survive. It's been three nights, maybe four. To be honest I lost track awhile ago. The seconds turned to minutes, minutes to hours, hours to days. I forgot how long I've been running, was it safe yet? I risked a second to catch my breath. Listening closely I heard the faint whisper. That strangely familiar whisper.  I Finally decided that this was enough. That ""thing"" killed my brother and it was going to pay. I picked up the biggest and strongest stick I could and waited. I saw it. It slowly approached then stopped a couple feet in front of me. I had enough waiting, it's me or it, either way, this ends tonight. 

I lunged, as quickly as I could I smashed the stick on its head, it seemed shocked, but I wasn't about to stop. The stick broke in half, what i now held in my hand was shorter and sharp at the tip. I stabbed with all my strength towards its chest, it moved. My weapon stabbed through its shoulder, it howled in pain. It swiped at my legs with its other arm and I collapsed. It got on top of me, pinning me down. Blood dripping from his shoulder on to my face. It brought its face close to mine and with that familiar voice, whispered,

The last few nights had been relentless. It came fast and hard, first a few drops, then a downpour that could last hours. A cold sting that wormed its way through his hood and his boots, only stopped by the mask strapped to his face.


You needed the mask.
The mask, with its sour scent of rubber and sweat. Sometimes he fantasized about pulling it off, letting the drops hit him, coursing down his cheeks and into his mouth. Washing away the filth that had accumulated over so many years. He knew he’d never do it. He’d seen what the air did to you. People bleeding from their eyes, their ears. Convulsing, vomiting. Hardly a good way to go.


He huddled closer to the candle he’d lit, its weak orange light reflecting off his goggles. He’d been caught in storms unprepared before, had them rush and surround him before he’d been able to get his bearings. He wasn’t easily frightened. You couldn’t be, not if you wanted to stay sane. But the darkness and the wind and the cold, they hit you and all you could do was curl up and hope you weren’t attacked, that your mask didn’t fail, that everything didn’t choose that moment to go wrong.
Lightning flashed in the distance.


Thunder followed.


The lightning made him nervous. The storms had been getting more violent. He could remember when they’d consisted only of rain, a shower that rarely lasted more than an hour. Then they’d began to get longer, stretching into the night. Pouring harder, more angrily. A month ago, the lightning had started, a flash-bang duet that sent chills down his spine and lit up the landscape. Far too quick for him to grasp his surroundings, but plenty long enough for something to see him.


It was worrisome.


He liked to be in control. Control meant safety. The candle meant safety. He could light it where he wanted, when he wanted. He could shield the light, make sure it would be private. Most importantly, he could make sure it wouldn’t give him away.
He couldn’t control the lightning.


It flashed again and again, and as it continued his fear got harder to bury. He was too exposed, too easy to spot. He’d perched between the tires of an overturned jeep, thinking he’d have the upper ground if something came at him, but now it just felt foolish. Like he’d placed himself on a silver platter. He hunkered down further, pulling his coat tight, his breath noisy as it reverberated through the gas mask. Once or twice he thought he spotted something in a flash, the head or eyes of one of those things. But it was always nothing. An abandoned dryer, a forgotten air conditioner. Words that were like puzzle pieces to him, holding a certain familiarity but impossible to place.  He couldn’t say which piece of scrap was which, couldn’t say what purposes they served…only the words remained. He wasn’t even sure where he’d picked them up, only that they were there, somewhere hidden in his mind.


Another flash.


Another glimpse. Something was there. Barely a glimpse of a shadow.


He shook. The fear, *dear God*, the fear. To survive so long, clinging to life, to scrape by day after day hiding in the undergrounds, grabbing gasmasks off long dead poor bastards who were lucky enough to die in the beginning, to confront your own death day after day was barely an existence at all. But it was his existence. His life to control, and control was what he needed.
To control anything out here, that’s what kept you sane.


That thing. That thing out there, it was snuffling around, he could hear it, out of his sight and out of his Control, searching for him. They couldn’t see well, no better than he could in this storm, but he knew they had noses like…like something. The word had been there, but it was gone. 


He refocused his attention on the candle, well hidden out of sight of anything on the ground below the jeep. The light calmed him, coaxed the adrenaline from his system in small increments. Whatever was out there couldn’t hear him, couldn’t see him, and his scent was wrapped up in his layers of coats and his gasmask. The flame was keeping everything okay, everything fine. Nothing but the light and the small wisp of smoke rising from the tip-


**BLOODHOUNDS.**


Noses like bloodhounds. That was the word. They could smell anything, the smallest out of place particles in the air and they would congregate, narrowing down their search until the source was found. Then the frenzy would begin, and you would scream and scream and scream and no one would help you because you are alone in the rain and you were to stupid to consider the *smoke.*


He stares at the flare, *stupid*, the pit in his stomach growing and he’s going to be sick, he didn’t think, and now there’s billions of the particles out in the air and he can’t Control them, can’t get them back, and there’s more of the snuffling things out there.
And he can hear them now. They’re all around, and he extinguishes the candle in a last attempt to regain Control but he knows it’s pointless.


And the lightning flashes again.


And he sees them.

Seeing as he lives in California now, the only thing to keep contact is to Skype and play games together on Steam.

After a while, he had introduced me to his new friends on Skype, and you could probably guess that we also played games on Steam together like Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2, all that jazz. However there was one peculiar friend that Jerod had introduced me to. His name was Josh. It was funny, because on Skype, he hadn't decided to reveal his full last name. It read 'josh k.'

I didn't like Josh from the start. He was always annoying, and imitating Jerod's personality, as if he didn't have his own. A few days later, Jerod started to ditch Skyping with me to Skype with Josh. I found that weird, because Jerod kept putting his constant calls down when we were Skyping calling him 'annoying' and a 'pest'.

But, in the few times we were all Skyping together, we were playing Saxton Hale on Team Fortress 2. Josh had the shittiest microphone ever, a built in one at that. It displayed static sounds 24/7 and it was really, really pestering both Jerod and I.

After a few months, Josh had changed his Steam name from Dr. Apple to AppleHead. Jerod had told me he did this because he is a ginger in real life. So we kept playing more games together, but each time we talked to him, we could feel his voice becoming more depressed, more stretched, and each time just a little more static. Fast forward a month from now from when he had changed his name.

Jerod told me in March, right after my birthday on the 26th, that he had stopped coming to school, and couldn't get in contact with Josh. Josh didn't appear in school for 3 weeks, and he was reported lost. A couple days later, Josh was online on Steam. His name AppleHead was highlighted in blue and his status was Busy. I decided to message him anyways, seeing as what had been happening recently.

/Mr. Dr. Core: hey/
/AppleHead: im busy/
/Mr. Dr. Core: what ahppened to you recently?/
/AppleHead: nothing why?/
/Mr. Dr. Core: well jerod told me that you weren't art school recently for a couple weeks and he also said that the cops are searching for you/
/AppleHead: ik/
/Mr. Dr. Core: then wtf?/
/AppleHead: im coming/
/Mr. Dr. Core: wat?/
/Mr. Dr. Core: where are you going?/
[about a 6 minute pause]
/Mr. Dr. Core: hello?/
/AppleHead: what/
/Mr. Dr. Core: where are you going?/
/AppleHead: im running to you/
/Mr. Dr. Core: lolk/
/AppleHead: im in michigan./

I paused for a second. My thinking was abruptly stopped. Jerod hasn't told Josh that I was in Michigan, in fact, we NEVER told anyone of his friends I live in Michigan. I don't have a facebook, and I sure as hell don't have any of my locations down on any social website.

/Mr. Dr. Core: how the HELL do you know where i liv?/
/AppleHead: becuz i c u/
/Mr. Dr. Core: what?/
/Mr. Dr. Core: this isn't funny/
[2 minute pause]
/AppleHead: stop touching your eyes, it's not healthy/

Enough was enough. I was creeped out, how did he know I was rubbing my eyes?

/AppleHead: just go to sleep/
/AppleHead: its 1:31 am dud/
/Mr. Dr. Core: where the fuck are you/
/AppleHead: chk ur window/

I rushed to the window that was nearest. Not there. I checked the window in my room. I saw a shadow run past the garage light. I desperately ran to my backdoor, busted it open, and started searching for the bastard.

""Josh, where are you?!""
There's some rustling in the rose bushes. I walk over, and carefully examine them.

After an hour of searching, I went back into my house, stressed. But when I came back inside, there was blue ink splashed all over the wall, and it had said: I'M HERE

I checked my computer and on the Steam chat it had said:

AppleHead: imhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhere

There was a window opened in Notepad. There was a small message that read: find me plz im lost

That night, I drove to a hotel and slept peacefully, until at exactly 3 AM, I heard banging on the door. I opened the door, and of course, nobody was there. I stepped out, taking 3 paces from the door. It shut  behind me. I tried to reopen it, but it had been locked. I heard crashes coming from inside, and when the door had been unlocked, the room was covered in splashes of black ink, with the window opened. There was a note on the desk by the bed, it was scrawled on, but it was readable, and it said: 'goin' to your daddy's'

My dad had moved away when I was little, about a year old. I forgot about him. I had never saw him again. The next day, after watching the news for a while, there was a news report of a dead man. His name read out 'Steve Sch****'. That was my last name. I called my mom quickly, she was sobbing. I asked what my dad's name was and she whispered 'Steve."" I said a quick thank you and hung up.

I went back home from the hotel, and when I came back, the wall had been repainted white..?

I went into the bathroom and found yet another note that read ""Sorry about your wall""

I walked into my room cautiously, and I found blood on my dresser with a blood stained note saying: ""this is your daddy. you're next.""

I went back on my computer to find the desktop background changed to a complete solid blood red. The more recent message from the ginger was ""im coming back."" He was offline.

I sat down for a while. I decided to stay at a friend's house and take my laptop with me. Everything was fine that day, we played some video games together, we talked about our recent news, etc. But when I woke up, my friend David was gone. He texted me saying: ""hey man, im gonna go somewhere, brb soon k?"" He texted me this at 3 AM.

I was able to contact one of Jerod's friends, Aaron. He told me that Josh had been coming to school again about 2 days ago. I told myself that I was done.

A message came from my phone from my Steam Mobile app. 
/AppleHead: do it/
/AppleHead: you can do it/
/AppleHead: there's nothing wrong with it/

It was painful remembering this allover again, but I had to write this so the world could know. If someone has experienced something similar to what hell I had to deal with, you are not alone, I believe you.

In 1993-1994, my family moved to a new house located on the south side of Chicago, near Ford City shopping mall. My brother and I did not like the house, we knew something was wrong there, but had no choice. The creepiest part of the house was the door leading to the basement. When you opened the door, you would see on the other side a dark creepy looking monster. It looked like it was trying to claw it's way out of the door. 

At first things were OK at the house. That was until My mom and brother got sick. My brother and mom were both diagnosed with cancer. My mother fought long and hard and passed away in 2000, my brother luckily survived and kicked cancer's ass. When they first discovered their illnesses, I too became afflicted with something as well: Chronic Migraines. I started getting them in 1997 and still have them to this day. 

Back then I was very sick, the only way to get rid of them was to take tylenol or advil and sleep it off. That is when I started getting strange dreams and nightmares. I had strange dreams of fighting a demon that was killing everyone around me that I loved. I fought it for days and finally I was able to trap it, but at the same time I was trapped with it. The strangest part of the dreams/nightmares was that they continued exactly where the last one left off. The next dream I had was disturbing. 

I hated horror films and never watched them due to my weak stomach. I had a dream of killing my family and eating them, I saw a sea of blood around me and piles of other bodies. I woke up and immediately ran to the washroom, violently puking in the sink. I thought, maybe it's the stress of my Brother and Mom being sick, that it would go away eventually. 

It just got worse. I was getting so paranoid that when I went to sleep, I would lock my bedroom door and put something against it as well. One day my brother had to have chemo in the hospital and would be gone for a week. That's when it happened. I started getting dreams that I was awake with my eyes open, but unable to move and breathe. I could open my mouth, but I couldn't scream. 

I talked to doctors about this and the migraines. They said it was all in my head and there was nothing to worry about. I did some research online and thought it was sleep paralysis, or so I thought. I had this 5 days in a row, until the 5th night when I saw a dark figure. I could not move, I could not scream. I could only see a blank dark face. It put it's hand around my neck and slowly squeezed. It took pleasure as it was squeezing the life out of me. 

It lifted me up out of the bed, I finally saw it's true face. It was demonic in nature with dark black skin and red eyes. As I was at my last breath, I was able to regain control of my body. I punched the demon in the face several times and screamed out loud. when I screamed, the demon disappeared like a pile of ash. I looked into the mirror in horror as I saw markings on my neck of a giant hand and imprints of finger nails. My door was still locked and what I bolted against it was still there. 

I told my dad at the time and he was too tired from work to listen to me. My mom and brother were both at the hospital still. I took pictures of this on my Sony digital camera at the time, sadly the memory stick was corrupt and I lost the photos. The hard drive that had the photos on it crashed as well. (80GB Maxtor) I told my mom and brother when they came back from the hospital, but they didn't believe me. 

I had to deal with this ordeal for several years. I got our priest come by and bless the house. It helped for a little while,but not long enough. Whatever evil was in this house was not so easily removed. I was getting afraid to sleep. I was taking sleeping pills to try to get a good sleep, they helped some of the time. 

No one believed me, no one cared. It wasn't until when my Dad put up the house for sale, that he thought it was a good idea to get rid of the door. My mother passed away before he could do this. He removed the door and it was taken away with the trash the next morning. Finally! The door was gone and sent to the garbage! I am free! Or so I thought. 

I ended up moving out on my own before my dad sold the house. I moved and I lived in a small basement apartment in Niles, IL. It was OK sleeping there for a few months, I still had migraines, but I was able to manage them with painkillers. I didn't have to take sleeping pills anymore. Once a month I would get a really bad migraine, but I would sleep it off and be fine the next day. 

Until the demon came back. He followed me back to my new place and started terrorizing me again. This time the dreams were more violent and sick and twisted, and he tried every few nights to choke me and taunt me just for fun. He did not choke me as hard as the first time, but enough to be painful. 

I could not get any rest when sleeping, my personality was changing to be hostile and short tempered. The migraines were becoming more frequent. I tried a priest to bless my place again, it didn't help at all. The demon was becoming too strong. I was becoming more pale white as a ghost. The demon was trying to change me, corrupt me to become a monster. What I thought then was he wanted to possess me, and the only way he could do that, was to make me a monster in his own image. 

My brother came by to check on me and decided to stay the night over. My brother slept on the couch that night. My brother experienced the same thing I had been dealing with that night. It freaked the shit out of him out and he finally believed me. He did some research and found in Chinatown in Chicago a Precious Gourd. (It looks similar to this: http://fengshuiandcrystalinspirations.webs.com/apps/photos/photo?photoid=43680402) 

He said to hang it by my bed and it would capture evil spirits or entities and trap them into the bottle. That night I hung it by my bed, on my lamp. I stopped having those bad dreams and the evil that was trying to corrupt me was gone. I never saw it again. I was finally able to sleep. To this very day I still have the migraines, but they are manageable. I found out a few years ago that I have high blood pressure too. 

I am still searching for the picture of the door. I have it somewhere either printed out or digital. I will update my post once I find it. The photo is not a photoshop, but a true photo.

It's been six days since the headache. It'll be two more days until I face my imminent death. I've seen it, again and again when I dream. My death. The knife in my hand, a smile on my face. I drive the knife through my throat. And I wake up. It feels so real. Every time I wake up, I hear the voices. ''Kill yourself.'' I hear the static, too.

Will I bother to explain how this happened? I might as well. It won't save me, but I've come to accept that now. About a week ago I found an unknown folder on my computer. It was on my desktop and inside were a photo, an audio file and a text document. I opened the text document, it was named ''havefun.odt'' and it said ''it's started now. open the picture.'' I closed the file, and didn't think anything of it. I didn't write it, and thought it was a virus so I deleted it and emptied my trash bin. I checked for viruses and found a troijan, nothing major. After browsing reddit for a while, I thought it was time to go to bed. I exited mozilla and on my desktop I saw the folder I had just deleted. I opened it and saw the same audio and image file, but there was now also a ''please.ini''. I thought this was rather odd, but opened it anyway. It brought up the image in that folder. I jumped back and just stared at it for a while. I left the room for about a minute and just paced around in the corridor thinking. It was a picture of me. There was something else there that caught my eye though. A person in the mirror behind me. Link [here](http://i.imgur.com/J0trikn.jpg) (I hilighted the person). There also seems to be a distortion where the face is.

Get this, the picture was taken from my webcam. I didn't take it. Something else did. Something else had put it there on my desktop. And now, that something had changed the text file again. ''scared.txt'' I opened it and it read: ''open the audio file. or do I have to force you again'' I was so scared I just closed my pc and sat on my bed. I thought some music would calm my nerves. I was so wrong. I turned on my mp3 (kinda old school, I know) and there was just one file titled ''gotyounow - unknown'' (link to the audio [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMH4ccj6nyY)). I was afraid to play it, but I guess I had no choice. I heard static, and random screaming that was kinda hard to recognize as human voice. It was about 40 seconds long, and at the end I heard a faint sound that seemed to be a whisper. Then, silence. The track had ended. The silence was almost unbearable. Just dead silence. I didn't sleep that night.

You might think that it was over now, I know I did. But no. It was only going to get worse. The next day I had to go to school. Frankly, I was happy. I've always felt more secure among people. I didn't tell anyone, they wouldn't believe me. So I go through the day normally, nothing happens. On my way home though, get a headache. Nothing major, just a small pulsing at the back of my head. I got home, and it became a pounding, constant pain. I overdosed on painkillers, and it helped. A little. My vision was fuzzy, and I only remember one thing. The text file changed. It was now just one line, just one character. ''8''. I was so tired, I went to sleep. Nightmares, screaming and my suicide. It was so vivid, I could taste the blood when I woke up. When I woke up the computer was on. Did I leave it on? I can't remember. The text file was still open. ''7''. I wasn't even surprised anymore. I wanted it all to end.

Too much has happened now to keep track. I only remember when things change because the text file is counting down the days. As I write, it's 11:59 pm and I hear the voices. Constantly. It's only getting worse, and I can see my death whenever I close my eyes. I've confirmed it now. The file changes at midnight. ''1''. My guess is, I will die tomorrow night, when it reaches zero. I will succumb t the voice and kill myself. It's almost like it's already happened, so many times I've seen it. I won't write anymore, I can hardly think. All I hear is the screams closing in.

I love it. I love reading the scary stories and the imagination of the people on there. But, one day, /r/creepypasta... Became my worst nightmare.
	
When I first started exploring /r/creepypasta, I noticed one particular author with the username: Cold_damage. I always loved his stories and up voted and commented on everything. Respective criticism is exactly what makes a good author in my opinion. In return, he gave respective criticism as well. But, even if we were so nice to each other, I believe it’s a competition between us as to who can write the best pasta. It may have gone too far..
	
One night, I wasn’t really planning on going to sleep. Just gaming and browsing Reddit. I was up at about 3:00a.m just writing another pasta to post before I dozed off. Everything felt normal in respects to every night. Until I started getting paranoid when I heard several light taps on my window every couple of minutes.
	As I was writing, I turned around several times trying to figure out what the hell the tapping noise was. It was 3:00a.m and I’ve been writing and reading creepy pasta all night. I’m scared shitless. I finally work up the courage to go check it out. I slowly open the window and look out.. To the left.. To the right.. Nothing. It could have just been the wind or me just being paranoid.
	
After I checked out the tapping noise, it stopped. 3:30a.m came around and this time I was NOT being paranoid. I just heard the front door open and close. No one is in the house except me.
	I always kept a knife in my computer desk. Yes, I’m THAT kind of guy. I quietly crept out of my room and looked around.. Nothing in sight. But, then again, my house was pretty big and had many little hiding places and crevices. This is going to take a little bit more than just a casual peek. I was terrified to go exploring my house for a possible serial killer or burglar.
	Suddenly, I heard music. It was from the guest room where my friends sleep when they come crash. The music was very low in volume. “creeping in the night will keep me out of sight..” This wasn’t what wanted to hear at the moment. This is crucial. I started toward the guest room, knife in hand and fear flowing through my veins. 
	
I walk in the doorway very cautiously and immediately see what I was looking for, in plain sight. A man, or a demon, or a monster. I couldn’t tell. It was a figure with a cloak on with no part of it’s body revealed. It’s just sitting on the guest bed and looking down. I blurt loudly, “What are you doing in my guest room?” “Who are you?” No response at all. No movement and no noise except for the creepy music.
	Regretfully, I move closer. I keep asking who he is and why he is here and why he won’t move or speak. I tapped his shoulder and as soon my skin touched the cloak, my body temperature felt like it went from 98.6°F to below freezing. I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed. I fell and hit the ground. At this point, he decides to stand up. In the most horrifying voice I’ve ever heard, it says. “Hello, Yabarasu. You may know me as Cold_damage.” I was instantly shocked. He found out where I live and now he’s come to punish me because of friendly competition? Again he spoke, “I’ll never have to worry about you again. You can never move again. You’ll be dead in a matter of hours because your body temperature is steadily dropping.

When you're fully awake you head into the bathroom to get ready for another busy day at work.


You walk out the front door at 8:30 AM, fresh and ready after a nice hot shower and a good healthy breakfast, ready to take on the office. You walk, since it's the healthier option. You always did think about your figure and looking good.
At 8:50 AM. You're still ten minutes early, so decide to wait outside and light up a cigarette. After you've finished you head up the steps and into the office for another busy day on the phones.


Finally, after five hours work you're allowed out to grab some lunch. But that bastard who works in the office with you follows you out. He calls after you and asks you if you'd like to join him, and you agree, even though you don't really like him, he doesn't get you, he doesn't make you happy. There's only one person who can really make you happy.
On the way back, you both stop outside for another smoke. He tells a joke and you laugh, even though it's not funny, and stamp out your cigarettes and both head back inside.


At last, it's 5:00 PM and you're able to leave after a hard days work. Visibly tired you head down the steps and start the walk home. The bastard calls you again and asks if you'd like to come round for a drink, like he does every night. But as always you kindly decline and head back home.


Once you're home, you start cooking yourself some dinner. It's lasagna. You've always been a good cook and it looks and smells delicious. You sit yourself down in front of the television and eat up your dinner. Then after a couple hours of relaxing, you head upstairs for another shower.


You open the window to let the steam out and jump into the hot shower. When you finish, you step out, your dripping wet, naked body glistening in the bathroom light before you wrap a towel round you and go to dry your hair.


After you've finished you put on your pajamas and plop a couple of sleeping pills into a glass of water, which begin to fizz as they sink to the bottom. You used to have trouble sleeping, but with these pills the doctor recommended you sleep like a log. It's a warm night, so you open the bedroom window and head back into the bathroom to brush your teeth.


Finally you slump into bed and quickly gulp down the water. You feel the pills start to work almost immediately, and you rest your tired head on the pillow and slowly your eyes close, finally you can rest after another busy day of hard work.


And finally I can come in.


I've waited all day for this. I slip though the open window and quietly creep towards your sleeping body. You look so beautiful when you're asleep. I lick my lips with anticipation, drooling slightly over your gorgeous figure. It's been such a long day.

Every evening the sun relieves my eyes from revealing the world around me and lets my mind take over. Every evening I see that same toothy frown. 

In the dark second-story window of an apartment on my route, I've always been curious as to what exactly is making that terrible grimace. It could be some doll or perhaps a painting. As benign as I'm sure it is, I have to say it certainly sends shivers down my spine to look at it. Large human teeth stretched almost halfway across the window-pane. It's an absolutely massive mouth for any person or animal I've ever seen and so I'm sure it's just a toy, but... Who would make a toy that simply frowns all the time? I wonder if that's why the owner has left it facing outside. I can hardly bare to look at it from the street; I couldn't imagine what it must seem like up close. Why then, would he keep it? A family heirloom? Yes, that must be it. It's nothing more than some old doll passed down through the generations and the owner couldn't bare to part with it.

What is it, though? I've seen it dozens of times I know, but I could never figure out precisely what it's supposed to be. The street lamps will be lit soon and by that time, I'm sure it will be too dark to get a good look. I'd rather not bother the family inside, so perhaps I'll just take a few steps closer to inspect it and be on my way. The strangest thing is that as I get closer, the frown seems to get larger. Not just by reference but it seems to be stretching farther across the window... Could it be alive after all? No, that's silly. It sits so still in the window, surely my mind is just playing the same old tricks, but... there's something more. Under its frown is something shiny. No, two things... Eyes, maybe? That wouldn't make sense. I wish I had a better view. The deeper I stare, the more it seems those ""eyes"" stare back, and the frown seems to be slowly swaying back and forth as I get closer.

The lamps are being lit one-by-one now. The first illuminates the street just enough so I can still see the frown. I take a step closer but the lamplight seems to fade. Another is lit and I can see the glimmer off of those strange objects under the frown. I move closer but still, the street is so dark. Finally, one directly in front of the window and I see... nothing. Nothing but total darkness around me and that menacing frown still sitting in the window, swaying back and forth. It's almost hypnotizing. I'm getting terribly dizzy but I can't look away. Just as I feel as though I'm about to faint, it all stops. Thank goodness... the light seems to be returning but my vision is so blurry. There, it's correcting itself now and I can see the street lamps but they're... outside. Clearer still and I see a man who appears to be lying in the street but it's all upside down. The street, the lamps, the buildings are all upside down. The man picks himself up and walks away and I want to yell for help but I can't seem to move a single muscle in my body. Someone else is coming along. I need to get his attention. If I try, it seems I can just barely move my lips.

It's been about three months since I listened to the Song. It started off as something do innocent; we were just passing by a boring Saturday by looking up ghost videos and other most-likely fake paranormal phenomena cut on video or audio. If we would have known what we were getting in to...god, if we had known...

The ""Occurrences,"" as I've come to call them, began almost immediately, on the night we had first heard the dreaded sounds of the Song. Even before that, even as I was first hearing those noises, I knew something wasn't...right. Something about the Song just felt unnatural. It didn't belong here. It shouldn't have existed at all.

But I shoved those thoughts away. Blamed it on my usual easily-paranoid self. Along with the fact that I had an idea as to how the science of the Song worked: low frequencies. Just like electrical disturbances at certain wavelengths it can cause emotions such as paranoia (that feeling that someone's watching you), anxiety, and in some cases even hallucinations over a long period of exposure.

So I blamed my emotions on that. Whoever had made the Song knew what they were doing, and did it well. I've come to learn that I wasn't wrong, but I had no clue of the whole truth...

That night, as I lay in bed trying to sleep (an act which I already have a problem doing with a history of insomnia) I found myself on edge once more. The notes of the song. The hollow chorus noises were stuck in my head. Damn that song for what it's worth, it was catchy. And now on nearly permanent repeat in my brain.

But again, I tried to ignore it. Along with all the other thoughts buzzing around I now had to try and deal with this unsettling Song. Then I began to see the shadows. Quick little blips at the edge of my vision that would dart away as soon as I tried to focus on them. I've had this before though, when I would have long bouts of insomnia with sleep deprivation, so it was nothing new and I just wrote it off as hallucinations once again.

Eventually, passed all the thought and the paranoia I managed to fall asleep. I shouldn't have. I had no clue that they were still there. Still...there...

I tried to keep this short, so sorry for dragging on, but the story so far will take awhile to catch up on. I'll be writing more in this journal as I attempt to recollect the events that have lead up to this point.

Until then, I warn you to read on, but appreciate the attention to my existence in these possibly last few days.

If you drive down it alone in the rain, day or night, you will suddenly have a very real feeling of being completely lost. Your radio will turn to static, your CDs will skip, and your tapes will play slower than normal. If you try to find a map in your car, it will have mysteriously vanished. If you continue forward down the road for more than a minute, you will find that you can't turn around, and everything behind you is pitch dark. There are no other roads or cars.

Continuing down the road, you will come upon a fork with no signposts. In the middle of the fork, there will be a man, covered head to foot in various pieces of clothing. The only skin visible will be around his eyes, which will be bright green. You must get out of your car, but do not turn it off or close the door after you.

You must approach the man, but stop at least three feet away. You must stand there silently, waiting for him to speak first. If you break the silence first, you will find yourself back on a main road, but you will die within 24 hours. If he speaks first, he will ask you what you require. Tell him that you need to know which road will take you to your destination. He will then ask you what you will offer him in exchange for his assistance. If you offer him a ride, he and your car will disappear, and you will become the new guardian of the crossroad.

If you offer him an umbrella, he will take it and stab you through the chest. If you offer him your love, he will take your heart still beating from your chest and eat it. Condemning you to walk the earth without a heart, insane from the pain and loss. You must offer him your loyalty and kneel before him. If you do this, he will close his eyes and bow in return, extending a hand to whichever path will lead you back to safety. But if you try to run from him, you will be dead before you reach your car, and your body will be found back in your car, deep in the swamps of the Everglades.

To get an idea of the area I live in the country that is heavily wooded in northwestern PA. My house is 100 yards from the barn (to the left) and 200 from my  grandmas (to the right).

This morning started like any other morning. I got up at 4 am, ate some toast, put on my barn clothes, and headed out the door.
  
However it all changed when i went outside. Normally the birds would be chirping, peepers peeping, and the owls hooting. It was dead quite and it was darker than dark out. I began my way up the driveway, I began to hear a strange noise. It was a slow and deep toned wub. I began to walk quickly, it was creeping me the hell out.

At the intersection of the driveway and the road I looked to see if there was anyone coming up/down the road. First to my left, then to my right and there it was. A pair of red lights came from the woods near my grandma's  house. 

""What in the god damn,"" I murmured to myself.  

I stood there staring at it. At first I  thought it was a vehicle, but no, the lights were roughly 7 feet in the air. I stood there terrified. Minutes passed nor it or I moved. It then made a zinging noise (like a light saber) it  was loud pitched and fast. It began to sway back and forth back and forth, then it stopped to where it originally was. It began to creep out of the woods tree towards the road slowly, but gaining speed as it ventured out onto the road. It froze for a second and it started to move again, this time towards me! I jumped, did a 180, and booked it to the barn. 

After milking I went to go check it out. I found nothing out of the ordinary after hours of searching.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1j53t0,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j53t0/red_lights/,

1373359338.0,16,self.creepypasta,1hxako,Why did,Leeoftheswift,20,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hxako/why_did/,"There was this game I was playing throughout the summer, for personal reasons, this game shall not be named. 
Anyways this all started after my friend approached me and asked if I heard of ""this"" new MMORPG game. I hesitantly said no because I'm actually trying to lay off gaming due to school, social life, and finding a job. I admit, I WAS a hardcore gamer back then and I would usually blow hundreds of dollars on some gear I was probably never gonna use. It wasnt more important than my own life. Its just a game.
So, later in the week, I decided to ""try"" this game. Its not like I could casually get back into my destructive path of addiction again so easily. I started up my PC, downloaded the game, and watched the opening sequence. I admit, it did look pretty cool. It was the type of game where you hack and slash, find loot, grind for hours, etc. casual RPG stuff. I quickly whipped up a half assed character, named her something lame, and started the game. As hours flew by it got pretty fun, I have to admit, but not fun enough to bring me back to being an addict. I turned it off and went to bed.
This schedule happened throughout the week. Since this was an online MMO, I've met a few People here and there. Helping me thru quests, helping me grind etc, etc. I came across one person tho, for the same reasons, this person shall not be named. Ill call him ""Slasher"".
So Slasher was typically helpful. Like Giving me stuff I need and I was grateful. We began to be very buddy buddy and even started being my regular ""Quest Mate."" Years flew by and I hardly noticed time flew at all. This game was fun and to me, my new friend was very cool. This one time Slasher started dancing out of nowhere. I laughed and decided to dance with Slasher. We would do this for a couple of minutes, then continue on our quest. Then repeat it randomly from time to time. I never had so much fun playing a game with someone so special.

One day, during a normal quest, Slasher finally asked me out of the blue,.. and to this day it haunts me..
""Hey, so, I'm leaving in a few days to go on vacation and would love to play with you until I leave! don't worry tho, Ill be back in a couple of days!""
I said ""Sure! Of course!"" with no hesitation. Even tho we can't physically ""see"" each other, I knew. I JUST KNEW, Slasher was smiling. Wherever that may be. The next day, to my surprise, plans came up and I couldn't play that day. I didn't have time to quickly log on and let Slasher know what happened. At first I felt bad, but then relief came as I thought ""Its just one day, Slasher will be on a couple more days till Slasher leaves."" 
The next day, to my dismay, My PC actually broke. I freaked out and didn't know what to do. I thought to myself, am I being punished somehow? Or did I simply run into some bad luck? Regardless of the case, a few days passed and I didn't care anymore. ITS JUST A GAME right? Its not like we actually knew each other. Not even our real names. Our addresses, phone numbers etc. NOTHING. Hell, I didn't even know what sex Slasher is and vice versa. That's why I always refer to this person as ""Slasher"". I had no reason to feel bad. Besides, Slasher probably felt the same way.
Over the years I have forgotten about this game and carried on with my life. It was is as if I never played it in the first place. I even bought a new PC, but the interest to play that game again simply faded. The only small fragment of memory I did seem to retain was being with Slasher and all the fun times we had. It was fun to reminisce but, that's in the past.
Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. Whether it was just simply being out with friends or just doing something else, I simply didn't have any interest anymore.

One day I was tremendously bored and decided to Log back on the game. I mean hey, just for a few hours wouldn't hurt right? On the flip side, I wasn't even feeling any anxiety or anything, excitement filled me instead. I wonder if Slasher got super high level! Or if Slasher even remembers me.
I logged on and to my surprise, Slasher wasn't on. I checked my mail and for some strange reason, my inbox was full. A total of 547 from Slasher. The first couple of mail was full of worry. Stuff like ""HEY! HOW ARE YOU?"" ""Where are you? I missed you?"" ""Hows it going? I really miss you."" Stuff like that. Then, however, as I scrolled down, the mail got more...  violent.. ""HEY! are you gonna log on or what?""... ""I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING FUCKING SPECIAL"".... ""ARE YOU SCARED?"".... They go on and on until the very last letter. The subject was empty and the contents read, ""why did you"" an incomplete sentence. To me, this was all very overwhelming and I wasn't sure what to feel. I felt sad, angry, but most of all.. terrified. A small sign of relief came to me as I noticed the date the last mail was received. 
7/16/12. It was last year. Slasher most likely got over it right? I mean,.. it's just a game right.

 Regardless of all of that, I didn't let that phase me of my fun. It didn't bother me at all. I played for a couple of hours and logged off. The next day, same thing. It didn't bother me at all. I didn't feel any sadness or anything. Weeks flew by. Then months. Then ultimately, years. Over that time I did feel bad. I mean, I did want to play with him like the good times. Slasher's last words were to play with me. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a swell of sadness took over. I didn't know what to do. I knew what i felt was stupid. Slasher most likely moved on. I felt really silly. So I just kept playing, and playing, and playing. Ultimately I didn't mind anymore and my mind was at peace with it. That is until one day, while I was gathering on a level, I saw Slasher. Right there. Slasher came from my peripheral and into the center of my screen. At first I was excited. I frantically typed in the chat box, ""omg! long time no see! how have you been?! how are you?! its been so long!"" I could've written a whole paragraph.
Slasher didn't reply. Slasher just stood there. No motion. Nothing. I typed ""Hey are you there? hello?"" But still no response. The weird thing is... whenever I move, Slasher moves. I started walking slowly, and Slasher would follow. Then I started to run, Slasher started to run too. I stopped running and he would stop too. I started to get irritated and typed ""Okay seriously whats up are you mad or something?""
Slasher then turned around, and sat down. It seemed like forever, just watching my computer screen, trying to figure out what was going on. Then I came to a sudden realization. I checked my ""Friends List"" and discovered.. Slasher wasn't even ONLINE.. and yet Slasher is right there. I panicked and thoughts started popping in my head ""oh maybe the game is glitched"" but then Slasher stood up, Came up to my character and.. the screen started to glitch, almost like random static. It then started to crash then turn black. Then for a very split second, the screen came back on and it showed a disturbingly close up view of Slasher's character face. Then my PC violently shut down. I tried to turn it back on, but no luck. Fortunately, on the 8th try, it turned on. My Desktop icons were all gone.. except however the game icon was still there. I re-launched the game but it kept glitching back to my desktop. No matter how hard I kept trying to re-launch, it just wouldn't come thru.
The next day, I took my PC to the nearest repair store. I didn't know what happened. I researched online to see if this game behaved to other people.
I've haven't gotten that much information until I ran across this one disturbing article.. It was about this kid who died.. on his computer. In his basement. As I read, I started to sweat, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. In an effort to reassure myself, I kept saying ""This can't be Sl-Slasher.. NO.. This cant be.. I-Its just a game......Right?..

(I'm not sure if they were called that, but that was where they used to take submissions.) I don't remember the name I gave the story, but the admin decided to post it on the website under the title ""String Theory."" I remember being quite happy with it being posted, and I was surprised to see a generally positive reaction.

So just a few hours ago, I saw a link to creepypasta.com. I had thought that site shut down. So I read through a few newer stories and then - out of curiosity - I searched for my story. Turns out it's one of the highest rated/most viewed stories. Who woulda thunk it? 14 pages of comments, only one or two of which I'd ever seen before, some dating really recently.

I'm not bragging or anything. Honestly I don't really like the story. I would definitely rewrite it a lot differently if I could. [Here's the link if you're curious.](http://www.creepypasta.com/string-theory/) It's sort of spurred me to try writing again. I want to try to prove to myself that it wasn't a fluke.

She always did that. She'd say 'you're 33 already. You have to get rid of those toys!'. My grandma didn't understand that I was especially fond of that one. She had already thrown away other trinkets from my childhood over the years and I learnt how to deal with it, but did it have to be that teddy bear?!

'Granny, where are you?' - I called, to no answer. The house was dark and silent, making you hear the hums of the appliances that  are only audible when our perception starts to get used to the unusual quietude.

'Grandma! I need to talk to you! There's no use in pretending you didn't hear me' - once again, nothing. She wouldn't have left home so late at night. Did something happen? The shadow of uncertainty that we have about the well being of a loved one, when things go out of routine, started to grow over me, like it was projected by the dim light of the living room growing distant.

Finally, a noise. Something breaking... where fr...from my room! What would she be doing there? I rushed, preparing my complaint: 'grandma, what's the problem in keeping my teddy bear in the living room? You always taught me not to mess with other people's belongings!' . I respected her and I loved her, but some things had a limit. I needed to impose myself.

The door was open. 'What the hell would she be doing in the dark?'. Before I turned the corner on the corridor, I reached for the light switch with my arm, to turn it on before going in, heritage of my fear of darkness that went up until my teenage years, but that I considered myself cured of. 'Old habits never die!'.

Click. Click. Click.

'What the hell?'- the lights wouldn't turn on. I put myself standing in front of the door and saw the porcelain of my little bed lamp torn to pieces in the ground, lighted by it's own lamp.



- I'm sorry, child...
- Grandma? Where are you? I can't see you with only the lamp's light on!
- I had to do it... or else you... you'd never...

Her voice was hoarse. What happened to her?!

I ran to the other side of the bed, the only place where she could be. My heart pounded with the certainty that she had fallen and hurt herself.

Nothing.

- Your problem will be solved now...

What the hell? Her voice came from the other side of the room now.

- Calm down... rest...

With every word, her voice seemed blurred away in some part of the room. Until I realized her voice existed in only one place: inside my head. The scare of that realization was suffocated by the one I had when I heard something moving behind me, kicking the lamp's shards. I turned in a flash.

It was my teddy bear. What kind of sick joke was my grandma up to?! I didn't give myself that much time to ponder about it and, in a childish instinct, I ran to hug my teddy and brush the fear away.

After jumping over the bed and extending my arm, when my hand was just about to touch the teddy bear, I saw it. The scream was stanched in my throat. My lugs locked down. Every one of the hairs in the back of my head bristled.

She was there. Or him. Or whatever it was. The tiny and worn out body of the teddy bear, standing up, like it had come to life as I used to imagine it when I was a kid. I couldn't see straight, until it took a step forward, shining light on its face.

With that step, I saw its face was familiar, but with a terrified - and terrifying - expression. A mix of pity, pain and anxiety. Like someone who commits an inevitable accident. It was there, in the teddy bear, the face of my grandmother. Its eyes were covered by some sort of cataract.

- My child... I gave my eyesight for you... to get you rid of your problem... calm down...

Her mouth didn't move. The voice was hoarse, but pounding inside of my head. I couldn't move. The perception of time is completely altered when your body in drenched with sweat and adrenaline.

- Now you will not shackle yourself to the past anymore... Farewell, child!

On a unrealistically fast movement, that being launched itself on top of me, jumping on the bed and throwing itself out the window. Not because I had recovered from the shock, but as an animal that doesn't want to turn its back to its predator, I ran towards it.

The once pleasant forest was now twisted and grotesque with wicked shadows cast by every tree. The long, slender branches reached high into the heavens as if to drag down the stars and extinguish their meager light. Conifers stuck straight into the sky like evil spears. The brush wrapped all around the path, reaching, grasping to drag me into the heart of the forest never to be seen again. Fallen logs and boulders gave the impression of corpses longing for the warmth of human flesh. I shivered, clutched my basket to my chest, and began the long trek home.

I began to whistle to help pass the time, but the shrill sound echoed eerily among the black trees so I stopped quickly. I heard a stick snap behind me and I flipped around.  I tried to tell myself it was a rabbit, to laugh it off, but something was wrong. I turned warily round and resumed my slow progress home. 

The forest is never silent, not even at night, but there was not a sound to be heard, save my heavy breathing and thunderous heartbeat. Perhaps a storm was coming so all the animals were inside. I glanced up to see a cold, cloudless sky. There wasn’t even any wind to rattle the branches. 

I turned my gaze back to my path, but a light patch on a nearby tree caught my eye. I moved closer to try to make out what it was. A sheet of paper was pinned on the bark. I leaned in even more and managed to read what was written on it: “Run, get away from here. He has come.” As the gravity of those words sank into my mind, a cold wind shrieked suddenly through the branches, ripping the page from the tree and blowing it away into the darkness. 

“A prank. It has to be a prank,” I told myself, but I knew that it wasn’t. The words had been scrawled in blood. I pushed on, down the path, my mind filled with horrible thoughts. I had to get home. I would be safe there.  Suddenly, the path ended. It stopped short. I looked around in a panic. My village was nowhere to be found. My heart pounded in my chest, the only noise in that terrible forest. 
     
My heart finally slowed, although the panic did not subside. It should be here. Paths don’t change in a few hours. Villages don’t disappear completely in a single night. As I stood trying to grasp what was happening, I heard the slow, ghostly melody of a clock chiming in the distance. I tried to detect which way it was coming from, but it swirled and it echoed so as to come from all around me. I kept going, though every fiber of my being screamed to run and hide. With my head down, I walked briskly when suddenly I smacked my head into something. I looked up to see what it was and I gasped. I finally understood why the forest was silent. Hanging from the branches, by the thousands, were the animals of the forest. Every last animal in the woods hung dead, a noose made just for it wrapped around its neck. I watched, horrified, as sparrows, rabbits, even foxes swung gently in the breeze. A chill ran up my spine. 

Among the grotesque corpses, I walked, desperately trying to convince myself it’s all a dream. Pushing through a final spot of brush, I entered a clearing. I finally looked up. In the distance, I saw what appeared to be our village bell tower. I went towards it, weaving among the trees, all the while a nagging fear pulled at the back of my mind. 

At last, I arrived at the tower only to find a massive pine instead of a bell tower. I walked around it. I didn’t recognize it at all. I looked down, and in a hollow among the twisting roots, I saw a girl, not much younger than myself, crying. 

“Hello there,” I said, trying to comfort her. 

“OH GOD! NO, PLEASE, NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!” she shrieked, scrabbling backwards against the tree. 

“No, stop! I’m not trying to hurt you. I want to help.” I said, moving my arms in a placating gesture.

Suddenly, she did stop. The blinding frenzy was gone, but the fathomless terror never left her. She looked deep into my eyes and said, “You can’t run. You can’t escape. Wherever you go, he will find you.” 

“Who? Who will find me?” I asked, but the frenzy was back and she could form no coherent words as she screamed and raged against the darkness. I tried to grab her to take her with me, but she fought me with the strength of one possessed. I decided to leave her. She was obviously mad.

I continued on, choosing a direction at random. The fear nagging at my mind, now covered it wholly. I needed to find my village. I needed to get home. Something in these woods was doing something and I wanted nothing to do with it. 

At last, the relief lifting a tremendous weight off my shoulders, I found the edge of the woods. “Oh, thank goodness,” I muttered. Then, when I finally was feeling alright, I turned around. I froze instantly, unable to even blink. The basket of firewood slipped off my arm. Standing amongst the trees was a man. He was tall and well-dressed in a Sunday suit. In his right hand, he held a golden pocket watch in long, white fingers. But his face was what really struck terror into my heart. It was blank white. He had no eyes and no nose and no mouth. Yet, I knew that he could see me, that he could find me without those. His head came up from the pocket watch and stared at me. Its empty stare dug deep into my soul, breaking it into pieces. Slowly, the long, skeletal fingers closed the watch with a click and dropped it into a coat pocket. 

Suddenly, I could move again. I turned and I ran, adrenalin coursing through my veins like fire. I had never run so fast or so long in my life. Finally, the sun began to rise in the east. As it reached over the tops of the trees, I stumbled into my village. It was empty, at this time of morning, quiet. In the cold sunlight, I made my way down the dirt street to my house. I opened the door quietly and stepped inside. As I latched the door shut, I turned. Standing silhouetted in the rising sun was the man with the white face.

As fast as the flash from the muzzle of the gun. I saw the expression on her face change in an instant. I saw the tears of fear running down her face turn from a clear color, to a thick and oily red. Her face, I saw it. I saw her life flash before her eyes. It showed on her face. And within seconds, she hit the ground. Everything was silent. Aside from the bang and the sound of her cold body smashing the even colder frozen snow. The only noises present. 

Trees were whistling in the wind, acting as silent watchers. The only witnesses. They saw everything. They heard everything. From her cries of terror, from my screams, and from his look of desperation. He didn't want her to die. Nobody wanted her to die. But she had to. 

Before everything happened, I spoke to him. I stood next to the near frozen lake and spoke to him. We argued back and forth. And then she finally showed up and within minutes her lifeless body hit the ground. I watched him ripple. I watched him turn red as her blood poured everywhere. I watched him as tears ran down his face. The snow, the lake, everything. Everything turned red with blood. Except me. I had nothing. Not a single drop. 

I walked toward the trees, towards her cold and blood drenched body. Away from the lake. And he disappeared. The second I moved, he left. I walked toward her body, inching closer and closer. I fell to my knees, tears freezing on my face. I went to wipe them. I realized I had the gun. I ran back to the lake and there he was. Looking straight up at me. Tears on his face.

I haven't been able to sleep too well since finding out.

Anyway: So my house has had a lot of weird things happen in the past, before I was old enough to even talk mainly, the one the I recall most is my mother freaking out about being able to hear someone chewing a sweet or something next to her bed and another one was coming home to find my mum's cooking had somehow turned to what looked like sour milk... Lots of things had happened though, nothing massive, just things that were a little off, like the reoccurring smell of ammonia and things going missing and reappearing.

Here's where it gets interesting: My step dad started researching the house, looking into the deeds and talking to previous owners. He finds out that the first owner of the house died of something to do with the throat (I forget what) and he would have had to chew big cough sweets to ease the pain which explained what my mother could hear. There was some other stuff he found but my recollection of him (my step dad) telling me is pretty hazy, the point is, there were odd occurrences going on in my house when I was a kid.

Now a couple weeks back my step dad (being the twat he is) decides to get an EVP recorder. I wanted nothing to do with it because fuck that. I asked him not to do it in the house, so him and my mum went down to the cemetery down the road, where Mr and Mrs Newell (the first owners of my house) are buried. The following was what I overheard my mum and my auntie talking about:
My mum asks a question in the graveyard and the response picked up on the EVP recorder was ""I miss [my name]"" over and over. She didnt even mention my name in the damn question.

I've always been a skeptic to the ongoing strangeness in my home but this shit. This has been keeping me up. Anyway my friend asked me to share so I figured I why not.

Independent Creepypasta movies.

I know this may sound difficult, but think of movies like Blair Witch Project. Low budget, no bigtime actors, nothing like that. Just some damn good scares and a few actors that nobody knew existed.

So what if we, once a few trailers get made, made a subreddit for these movies? We'd have trailers, posters, and links to the movies themselves!

We'd have Kickstarter pages, to get some money in line for the movies and equipment we'd need.

I was wrong.

I had time in the palm of my hand. A lovely ticking thing that I found under a floorboard, something beautiful that gave me minutes to count. Four thousand minutes to count—yes, I counted them all. I sat in my chamber and I felt the thing beat in my fist like a tiny heart. I counted the minutes even as the rain began. Rain isn’t good, you see, rain means shocks. But I had time. I thought I could have everything.

I remember before the Manor, there were things called “day” and “night”, but whenever I tried to remember anything else from Then, I got hot and needed to rest. Abigail would come, after Awhile to change the linens and I wouldn’t try anymore. Things are so simple, you see, everything flows together. I’d give up on trying to remember, because, well, why? Patterns are lovely in their simplicity. Minutes complicate things. 

As the rain fell down like wrath above me, I thought about Then, and I thought about how many minutes it has been since I’d come to the Manor. There was a time, in the beginning, when I used to try to measure by Abigail. How often she would come to turn the linens and dust. I’d always get fuzzy when I did, I’d get confused, and I’d stop. I used to think something was wrong. I used to have dreams about a little girl and a pretty woman in a meadow, where there was lots of sunlight. I remember sunlight, from Then, but Then is far away and I now believe that Then exists only in my dreams.

“Tea, miss,” Abigail says, and brings me the tray with the teapot and the cup. Always. She did this three times in the four thousand minutes I counted. I should not have counted, because counting made the simplicity go away. Counting made me…made me think about too many things. 

I…I saw that Abigail never changed. I have been at the Manor for many, many minutes, perhaps millions of minutes, but she has not changed at all. I change. She cuts my fingernails sometimes, and cuts my hair, so I know that…there is such a thing as change. I thought that it was…I thought that it was wrong that things flow into one another. I thought that the patterns were wrong. 

I miss the patterns. I know now that the patterns kept my mind intact. I wish I never counted.

I held time in the palm of my hand. I turned it over and I saw my face in it. I saw the wrinkles around my eyes and the ashes in my hair. 

In Then (in my dreams!!!) my skin was (IS) soft and supple. I am young. I was young. Too many minutes have passed. I wish I wish I never counted. I wish I never saw. I miss the patterns. I miss teamissbookteamissbookteamissbook it was easier it was easier.

It is raining again and the shocks will come. I want the shocks. I want him to know that I’m sorry. I killed time for him. I threw it against the wall, watched it explode into glass and springs and nothingness. No more tick tock. No more. I hope the shocks will make me forget. 

I was wrong. I am sorry.

On his freetime he visited all kinds of flea markets, second hand boutiques and pawn shops both in hopes of finding something truly valuable, and simply to pass the time. There was always something worth seeing. One day in a flea market he he frequented there was a curious painting. It was a portrait of a family, painted clearly in the victorian era, in a highly realistic style.
 The father, an elder man with greying hair, sat in a leather arm chair holding a cane, and around the chair stood the mother - a sullen woman around the same age, two young men just about old enough to be his sons, and a young girl, maybe nine or ten years old. There was something very strange about the portrait, even though it could have been the stern, cruel look of the father, and serious, almost mournful expressions of all the others. Andrew, who felt the burning need to study the picture closer, bought it, and took it to his flat.

The painting, though small, appeared to have taken ages to paint. The detail was amazing, though what baffled him was that it had not been signed anywhere. Any painter ought to be proud of such a creation. He studied the picture, first on his own, then by the help of his schoolbooks, library books, and the internet. He started to neglect his friends and school mates, turning down offers to go out on the weekends, then skipping lectures and ignoring school work. None of it seemed to matter, the work he was doing was important.

All the trouble was worth it as the mysteries of the painting slowly unraveled before him. He realised what made the family seem so odd: Though dressed formally, all of them seemed to be clothed to slightly different eras, the little girl sporting a plastic hair clip shaped like a butterfly, the kind that was fashionable in the 80s. Each answer he got of the mysterious painting, another question arose. As its secret finally revealed itself, it was too late for him.

Six months after Andrew had found the painting, a team of workers humorously referring to themselves as the 'clean up -crew' were sent to clear out the apartment of an university student that had been reported missing and found dead in his flat. The apartment was filthy, and there were piles of trash everywhere besides the middle of the living-room floor, where propped up on a chair stood a painting of an eldery couple, three young men, and a little girl with a single tear running down her face.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1355081589.0,,,True,t3_sfhfk,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/sfhfk/family_portrait/,

The creak of the chandeliers as the wind wafts through the room, the tinkling of the crystals as if the laughter of a small girl. Random thumps from the rats going through the walls, the wallpaper decaying and peeling off. Only the sound of your own footsteps echoing through the vast chamber and bouncing off the walls.

The creak of and squeak floorboards as they take your weight and you list off, again the scratching of rats paws under the boards. Their squeaks amplified by the narrow lanes. Old tables with candle holders, almost invisible as the wax covers their prongs, like a parasite around its host. Chairs toppled and broken, as if there was a struggle.

It hurts to know just what awaits many people out there. This isn't just some story...this
is a warning. At anytime, anywhere, you may find a door. There isn't much to the door accept
that the handle to the door will seem to be made of a rough white material and if you touch
the wood a slight pulse can be felt as if veins ran through it. Now this door can and will 
appear anywhere if it chooses you. It could mysteriously manifest in your home as a door 
that was never there before, it could appear in the place of a door you use all the time it
could even simply appear in the woods while on a hike. I can't tell you how it will happen to you
i can only tell you what happened to me.

I was at work, a security guard at a theme park, and needed to run to my supervisors office to grab
a new radio after mine had died. As i entered the operations building the hallway was mysteriously
walled off except for a door.....THE DOOR. at first i assumed it was some renovation to protect 
confiscated items so i thought nothing of it and stepped through expecting to see the rest of the
hallway. Instead what i saw was a round room of flat smooth grey stone. It was softly lit but from no
apparent source. The only thing in the room was a wooden table. For a moment i assumed i had zoned out
and somehow managed to get myself lost so i turned to leave only to find the door was gone. It sounds 
cliche but out of sheer confusion i ran my hands over the wall hoping to find somegive or something 
to tell me how to get out. Then i heard him.

""Ask me""

Two words that echoed through the room. Still thinking i was merely lost or something i assumed it was
someone in another office so i wrote it off and keep searching the wall.

""Ask me""

This time it sounded louder and more...present i suppose. I turned to see a man sitting at the table now
opposite where i stood. My voice seemed to turn off out of fear because i could not bring myself to say 
anything and for some reason i didn't want to. The man was slim and wore a two color suit. the left side 
of the suit was solid black and the right side was white. His eyes copied his suit but reversed. His left 
eye was solid white, no pupil, no iris, nothing but white, his right was the same except black. Even though 
they lacked any indication i knew he was looking at me, or rather it felt like he was looking INTO me.

""Ask me""

seemingly on instinct i approached the table and sat down. His gaze never left me. It almost felt like part 
of me understood what to do but it wasn't my brain. He continued saying those two words over and over. every 
few seconds until i could feel it building up in me. This will sound weird but i don't believe my brain formed
the question. i fell like it came from my soul.

""Ask me""

My body responded. ""What am I?""

He gaze widened and a jolt of pure unequaled fear shot through me until he spoke again.

""You are one of the few.""

And with that he opened his mouth revealing teeth that seemed not to even fit in there and a pure blackness 
behind them where a tongue or throat should be. From his mouth came a horrendous screech that felt like rusty
nails scrapping over my mind. Visions shot through my head of people being horrendously mutilated, people being
skin and flayed, and people simply crying and beating against the walls, each of these visions took place in the
very same room i was in now. When the screech stopped the visions didn't. As long as my eyes where closed all i 
could see was the suffering of those people. When i finally opened them i was now standing and facing the very 
same door i had come in through with the man standing beside it. I felt another question boil up in me.

""Who where they?"" i asked refering to the visions

""They were the many.""

And with that there was nothing. i walked back through the door and was once again standing in the hallway of the
operations building. The door was gone and the hallway was open again. But now i can't sleep, i can't relax and i can't
even close my eyes. All i see when i do is the suffering and torment of the people who did not make it out of the room.
So i warn you all now. If you ever see a door that seems out of place, or a door you know seems somehow different, DO NOT
OPEN IT!!! The door will not leave until its call is answered and you will want to see but i beg you to resist.
Every minute my mind is flooded with more people being trapped in the room and i cannot bare to see anymore.

I was tired the whole day and I just want to quickly doze off but I just can't. What I did was I'm flashing scenes I'd like to happen in my head, thinking I could fall asleep with those thoughts. 

After a few minutes, I still can't go to sleep. I know I was awake. I know my eyes are open because I can see my bed post. I can see everything in my room. I figured out that I should get a glass of milk to help me fall asleep but when I tried to stand up, I can't move a single muscle. I just can't. It's as if someone or something's pinning me down. I felt heavy. I tried screaming but I can't. Pictures in my head starts to roll like those scenes you see in movies and I can see them. It's as if they're real. I tried kicking. I kept squirming but there's no use. I just can't move.

After somewhat felt like a long time, I finally mustered all of my strength to stand up and I did. It's like I just opened my eyes though I knew my eyes were open when I was in that traumatic state. I was breathing heavily. This happens to me a lot and I don't know why.

I had recently gone through an extremely expensive divorce and was nearing financial ruin. My career offered little in job security and I was often forced to live paycheck-to-paycheck. My rent was due by Monday and I hadn’t enough money to pay it. I needed help, and fast.

Most of my family lived on the other side of the country and were unable to offer me any support. My friends and coworkers were too involved with their own families and problems to lend assistance. I was forced to search online for some type of cheap, temporary housing. After browsing endless ads, I could not find anything within my budget.

My desperate predicament had doomed me to post an ad that essentially begged for aid. I spent a few moments articulating the ad, making sure it didn’t sound overly pathetic, but at the same time attempting to invoke an empathetic response.

After reviewing my advertisement, I promptly submitted it. In another tab on my web browser I had my email account open and noticed an almost immediate response. It simply read:

     You can stay with me, Phillip.

I scratched my head, puzzled by the timely response. I continued to monitor my email for the next thirty minutes, but received no other messages. I decided to call it a night and get some sleep, hoping there would be at least one or two more replies by morning. I climbed into bed and quickly succumbed to a deep slumber, my worries having weighed heavily on my mind the past few days.

My alarm clock buzzed annoyingly and read 10:00AM. It was Sunday and there was no rush to wake up, but I was eager to check my email to see if anyone else responded to my current predicament, since I shamelessly broadcasted it the day before. After booting up my computer, I double clicked the web browser and navigated to my email home page. It loaded my account automatically and showed three new messages.

     “Oh good,” I exclaimed.

I proceeded to read the first message:

     Phillip, you can stay with me.

That’s odd, I thought. It was very similar to the response I received last night, but the email address was different. I moved on to the next message:

     Please stay with me, Phillip.

I felt a bit uneasy at this point. The wording, for some reason, was unsettling. I hesitatingly clicked on the final email:

     YOU CAN STAY WITH ME, PHILLIP. PLEASE STAY WITH ME, PHILLIP.

I jumped back in my chair. I didn’t know what to think.

I spent the rest of the day perusing online ads, still looking for the gem that would solve my impending crisis. During this time, I repeatedly checked my email for further responses. None showed up.

Later that evening, I wallowed in despair, knowing I had to be out of my apartment by the next day. The thought of living on the streets made me cringe. I poured myself a strong drink and sat down in one of my living room chairs. Tears filled my eyes as my depression exponentially got worse.

After a few hours of cumbrous drinking and self-pity, I remembered the odd emails I had received earlier. Perhaps the person was just lonely, I thought. Maybe it was a woman. Maybe her husband just died and she was desperate for company. I continued to rationalize the tone of the messages.

     “What do I have to lose at this point?” I asked myself.

I quickly jumped on the computer and devised a response, leaving my cell phone number in the last line. Almost immediately after I sent the reply, my phone rang.

     “What the…?” I bellowed.

I got up and walked over to the nightstand near my bed, where the phone rested. ""Unknown Caller"" blinked on the screen. I picked up the phone, hitting the answer button, and put it to my ear.

     “Phillip,” a woman said.

Surprised, I looked at the screen again, verifying that it was an unknown caller. I put the phone back near my ear.

     “Phillip, I want you to stay with me,” the voice hauntingly proclaimed.

     “Who is this?” I sternly questioned.

Silence. For a few moments, there was no answer. Then I heard a tone, which indicated the other party had hung up. Seconds later I received a text message that contained an address. It was about five miles from my locale, out in a rural area.

The next morning, I packed my vehicle full of most of my belongings. What little furniture I had I left on the curb, knowing someone would pick it up and put it to good use. I climbed into the car and fumbled with my phone, looking through the messages. I again found the address of the out-of-place area.

     “This is crazy,” I whispered to myself.

Slapping the gear into drive, I proceeded towards the unusual location.

I couldn't find it here so I thought the worst that could happen is it being a repost. Oh, and one last thing, I'm from Sweden, so I'll excuse any grammatic or spelling errors. Enjoy!*

For her 8th birthday, her parents had given her a beautiful German Shepard pup. It's soft fur was walnut brown with spots of black. However, the most intriguing part of the dog was its brightly lit light blue eyes. Ever since they first met, the dog never left her side, he was her most loyal friend. 

Fast forward one year, thier bond had only grown stronger, and so had the dog, it was almost as big as the girl by now. On this particular evening, the girls parents was staying at a friends house, so this was the first night alone, for both her and the dog. She wasn't scared though, her best friend was going to be with her the whole time, she had nothing to worry about.

After sitting up late watching the TV, she decided it was time to sleep. The dog already slept in her lap while she was watching the TV, so she pat the dog.
""Come on. Let's go to bed."" she said with a yawn.
The dog stepped out of the couch and began to walk to thier bedroom. The girl turned of the TV and followed the dog. She brushed her teeth and then laid herself on the bed. The dog, as usual, slept under the bed, and, as usual, the girl let her arm dingle over the bedside so her dog could lick her hand. That always made her fall asleep.
And so she did.

An hour or two later she was awoken by the sound of the dripping faucet in the bathroom. It disturbed her, so she went up and turned the handle as hard as she could, and the dripping stopped. She went back to bed, letting her hand dangle over the bedside, letting her dog licking her hand.

An hour or two later, the faucet had begin to drip again.
""Uugh..."" she thought to herself as she crawled out of bed to shut the faucet again. She went back to bed, letting her hand dangle over the bedside, letting her dog lick her hand.

An hour or two later, she was awoken by the dripping noise again.
""Not again..."" she murmured to herself as she stepped out of her bed to close the faucet. She closed the faucet. But from the corner of her eye, see saw something furry dangling from the bathtub, the drapes covered the rest.
""Oh, you silly."" she giggled to herself, she knew that the bathtub was one of her dogs favourite spots to sleep. As she pulled back the drapes to wake the dog and to tell him to go sleep under the bed instead, she noticed something was wrong. Instead of the normal black spots on the fur, there were red spots, the more she uncovered, the more frightened she got. The bathtub held only the carcass of a mutilated German Shepard and blood. She noticed blood on the wall behind the bathtub, so she looked up. There, inscribed with blood stood only one statement.

1365481778.0,13,self.creepypasta,1byy1b,The Fear of Prey,Redex_Ceo,19,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1byy1b/the_fear_of_prey/,"I’m not a man of many words… but if I may, I have a story to tell. I’m sure you won’t believe me even if I told you, but if you’ll listen I’ll start from the beginning. About three weeks ago I had moved into a new town. It wasn’t too big; it was built around a large church so the people who lived here were all very religious. I myself am an atheist but I respect them for their beliefs. The only real noticeable thing about the town besides the church was its graveyard. People must have come from far and wide to have their burials here because it was enormous, it might have been even bigger than the town itself. Any time I would walk by it I would always feel some kind of… chill… the wind would never blow around it and no matter how the caretakers would try the trees would always seem about to die. It was just so unnatural; I could never quite wrap my head around why. Maybe it was just that natural thing about graveyards that creeps people out. Anyway there weren’t many things to do around town, so I quickly took to walking. 

Every day I would walk, and I would just think about life. Where I was, where I was going, what would happen if… so many questions, not many people had the time to think about these things but the peaceful quietness of the town would just get me thinking about those kinds of things. Every day I would walk and take the same route… and no matter how I tried to avoid it I would always pass through that graveyard. The first two days were uneventful and boring, but I was still happy. But then on the third day, it was probably the first sign that something was off. I should’ve paid more attention to it.

On that day I had there were a few hooligans messing around with the graves. They were messing around and seemed to just be having their own fun so I didn’t really pay any mind to them. Then I heard some kind of large crash. I looked over to the hoodlums and saw them running off from some… large mess. Looking around I too see if anyone else was around… not a single soul in sight. So I casually walked over to see what the little thugs have done. The damage didn’t seem too bad; they only knocked down a little stone cross. I looked at the grave it was originally on, it read:

‘Mary Walsh’
‘1920 – 1925’
‘Loved Daughter’

I stared at the grave for a few seconds before returning to the cross and picking it up. It was actually much heavier than it looked but I managed to pick it up. Placing it back onto its rightful place I stepped back to look at my handiwork before I noticed something in the patch where it had been laying; a crushed, old, colorless rose. Picking it up I placed it with the cross and decided to take my first real tour of the grave. I had never truly explored it much so now might be as good as ever. I simply started to stroll through it and read the names off of the little tablets and shrines.
“Dallas”
“Clymer”
“Whitman”
The names ran on and on. No two tombstones were the same, and they all seemed to be celebrated with some manner of cross or bouquet. Realizing I had gone a bit deeper than I had meant to I turned back and passed the names again.
“Whitman”
“Clymer”
“Dallas”
Eventually I had returned to the Grave of Mary. Here is when things start to get a bit odd. The Stone cross and rose were both gone. I looked around for some chance that someone had taken it or that by some miracle a gust of wind blew them away… Once again I only saw an empty dead graveyard. I didn’t pay too much mind to it; I reasoned that for whatever reason someone came in and took it while I was off exploring. I started on my trek home where the next thing happened. It was a small glimpse of a white face through the trees. I only caught glimpse of it and when I did a double take I no one was there.  The rest of the walk home was uneventful, boring even for this little town. When I reached home I found a note reading only “Thank you”.
I should have realized by then what was up. I should have realized something was off. But for some reason my brain just rationalized this as some form of coincidence. I was such a fool.

That night I went to go to sleep, but couldn't quite nod off. I decided to look outside my window and sure enough… nothing was out of the ordinary. Shaking that nagging feeling I went back to sleep, but no matter how much I shut my eyes I couldn’t fall asleep. I felt that something was watching me but every time I looked around nothing was different. That continued for most of the night, A continuous cycle of me shutting my eyes, suddenly jolting up and looking for some unseen predator about to strike, and finally going back to shut my eyes.
The next day was a killer; I had not gotten any sleep so I felt I was going to drop dead at any moment. I couldn’t keep my eyes open but I couldn’t quite close them. Work was a hazy memory but I do remember finally being able to fall asleep on the couch as soon as I got home. By the time I awoke the sun was setting and there wasn’t any time for a walk, so I decided to get on my computer and check up with a few friends. No one was online so I simply laid back and started browsing the internet. I watched an episode or two of an anime a friend recommended and checked a few forums. But then an idea popped into my head. I wasn’t sure where it was from or what drove me to it but I typed into the search bar: (Mary Walsh Disappearance 1925.)

After a little digging I had discovered that Mary was the daughter of the pastor in the olden days. He was famous for his way of reaching out to people and his burials. However one day his daughter disappeared. He was stricken with grief; he quickly began to become more hostile and kept to himself. After a year of searching she was announced dead… Unable to cope with the loss the pastor was found dead on his own steeple, he had opened his wrist and was dead before anyone found him. The saddest part was they found Mary’s body two days later.

Finishing my researched I stretched and casually looked out the window, it was pitch black night out. But I could see something. It looked faint but outside I could see a figure pacing outside my doorstep. It was dressed in a long black robe as dark as night, the only thing I could see was its… head and hands. Its skin was pale white, so pale it was easily noticeable through the inky darkness. All it did was pace back and forth, back and forth, slowly, steadily, monotonous motions emerged as I just watched. And the more I watched the more thoughts filled my head. I knew I should go out but every primal instinct was telling me to stay where I was. I couldn’t let it out of my sight, less it pounces on me unsuspectingly. I felt I might need to call 911. I tried to reach for the phone, but I couldn’t bring myself to it. This figure was in all aspects a hunter. It gave me a cold feeling, something I’ve never felt before, something… It might have been what a mouse thinks when it sees a cat. Utter paralyzing fear that goes against all common sense. Why I was even feeling this primal fear I couldn’t figure out. It was simply walking back and forth, but as I gazed onto it my heart started to beat quicker. My breathing slowed down… time itself seemed to stop. 

Then something I can’t fully put into words happened. A little girl, dressed in white with similar skin to the figure walked into my field of vision. Without speaking she took the beings hand and the walked into the Darkness. After a few seconds I finally regained my sense and looked back to the computer screen.
*Matthew Gunn has come online*

I raced for the mouse and clicked through all of the windows until I reached Skype. Frantically clicking his icon I Pressed the call button, he eventually picked up after what seemed like forever, and I quickly began to try to form into words what had happened. He simply told me that I needed to get more sleep, and tried to lighten the mood by cracking a joke. A little annoyed I told him I had to go and hung up. I laid my head on the keyboard and stayed there for a while before going off and getting ready for bed.

That night was just like before, I couldn’t fall asleep… but now I knew something was out there, something unnatural. I still felt like calling somebody, but if I knew my luck they would call me crazy. So I waited the night out, with no occurrence. The following day I stayed inside… I couldn’t bring myself to opening the door. I kept it locked and tried my best to look around the internet for something… anything! That might explain what had happened the night before. Slowly I could feel my mind getting weaker and weaker… I felt more and more like a stalked animal. Occasionally I would turn away from the computer and look at the corners, at any flickering shadows. Every time I was greeted with nothing. I found this one story of something called the slender man… but he didn’t quite fit. And as the story goes I would probably be dead right now if it was him. A few more terrifying images and stories… moth man… Jeff the Killer… none of them quite matched the figure I had seen.
By the time the sun went down I was a nervous twitching wreck. I had gone 36 hours without sleeping and thoughts were racing left and right. What was it? What did it want with me? Am I going insane? Is it even trying to kill me? WHAT DOES IT WANT! The fear was unnatural; I didn’t want to be hunted. I just wanted to live my life. I can’t leave, it will get me. Please tell me why….!!!!!!!!!!!!???????

And then he came back. He paced left and right, left and right… the constant motion mocking ME! I don’t know what it wants! Why! Tell ME! All of these thoughts raced through my head as he just paced… left… right….  The constant motion… WHAT! What was he!?!? My head started to pound at that point. He was torturing me. I could tell, he must get some kind of sick pleasure from this. I was slipping, and then he finally turned and looked at me. He had cold dead eyeless sockets. I looked at him and his sick twisted face, it was contorted in pain yet was smiling with a sense of satisfactory… he looked relieved that some pain was finally over. And then the girl once again came and took his hand. But I knew he had seen me… I was next… he would take me soon.

By now I could tell I was alone on this. My friends over Skype all thought I really had lost it. I was rocking 48 hours without sleep, but I couldn’t keep my eyes shut long enough or stop my heart from racing long enough to get these feelings out of my head. These fears, what is going to happen to me? It pains me to even look back to those thoughts… today I would confront the figure. I couldn’t take the torture any more. I didn’t Care anymore. I wanted the torture to stop. By then my head was throbbing with pain yet I dare not step outside. I took one more look online before sunset. I revisited the old website I had originally found the Information on Mary and found a single quote from the priest.

“Mary loved roses... they were always her favorite.”
SO I went to my kitchen and found a vase of flowers and picked out a rose. It was crimson red and looked freshly plucked. It looked perfect for her. I still don’t know where this thought came to me from, but now a small light came to my heart. I was ready.

That night the man came pacing, and I came out. He stared at me with those cold dead eyeless sockets and I walked up to him. Having a closer look he didn’t look any more human than he did from my window. I was terrified… but I couldn’t handle the mental stress any longer. He held out his hand and I took it. At the same time the little girl walked up to us and took his other hand. We walked for a long time, and then I realized the path we were on. We were going to the graveyard. The church was when I stopped and looked to the little girl. Despite her cold white icy skin I looked at her and she seemed more human than anyone I had seen before. I handed her the Rose and said, 

“Here you go… Mary.”

 This of course surprised her to no end. And we stood there for a long time... when a car’s headlights could be seen speeding down the road. The little girl began to cry all of a sudden… she looked torn… and in one quick flash of motion the figure raised his right hand. It had a large blade protruding from the wrist.

This was it, my time had come. The torture would finally end. But as he raised his blade high into the air the little girl looked to the flower, and then to me, and in a blur of motion the old figure was pushed onto the street. It let out a cry of rage and grabbed me, pulling me out with it. We wrestled for a few seconds when I saw a blinding light and heard a deafening noise. 

Exactly one week later I woke up in a hospital, I had been told that I had been hit by a car; I had suffered a massive head injury and was just now woken up for the first time. A few bones were broken and might be paralyzed… but I felt better than I had felt, ever. The Throbbing in my head was gone, and I finally felt relaxed, nothing was trying to hunt me down and kill me. In fact I almost thought it was a dream, when I looked over and saw a note. With a rose: Thank You.

27.8.2012
I am investigating a case which has been left unsolved for months now. I'm not doing this for the sake of wanting to know the truth or anything like that. I'm doing this in memory of my partner, who was also on this case before he committed suicide a week ago. I feel like he's still suffering, like he want's this case to be solved before he can rest. It's haunting me. This feeling of him watching me.

The night he did it, last night, I was called to the morgue to identify his body. The person who called me there had this weird look on his face. Apparently what my partner did scared even that man, who had seen hundreds of corpses. Even though it was his job, he was scared. I walked over to the tray my partner was on and he slowly pulled the cloth covering him. He asked me if it was him, and with almost sad eyes turned away from the corpse. I collapsed. It was horrible. His face had been cut three times and the wounds were horribly infected. His skin was pale. His eyes were the worst part though. They weren't rolled up or closed. They were wide open. His expression was blank, but his eyes were so horrifying I couldn't look anymore. I felt sad and angry. What could make him do something like this? I knew it had something to do with the case he was working on, the same case everyone else had left unsolved. I blamed them. They did this.

The worker there stood in silence as I cried my eyes out. After I had calmed down a bit, he asked if my partner had any family. I said he had a daughter and a wife. He looked sad and hung his head. He said with a shivering voice ''Can you follow me please?'' I didn't know what to expect, but I knew it wouldn't be good. I followed him to another tray, and stopped. He stopped as well, and asked me ''What kind of man was your partner?'' then quickly pulled the cloth covering another body. It was his wife. I was almost numb from seeing the body of my partner but this still hurt me. I wasn't as shocked as you would think, I didn't know her that well. But a thought crawled into my mind when I looked over to a tray close to this one. It was clearly a child. I immediately knew who it was, even though she was covered with a cloth. It was their daughter.

My mind was racing. Who had killed them, and why? Was this the reason my partner committed suicide? Had the killer cut his face and escaped? I was about to ask if there were any clues as to who had killed them, but then I looked back at the tray with the daughter. There was blood in two parts of the cloth. The place where her neck would be, and just below her stomach.

It was no wonder that my partner had killed himself. No one could live with this. His wife and child murdered. And the things the killer had done. I made a promise that day. I promised to find the killer. I will find him, and take everything from him. I asked the worker who had done this, were there any clues to follow. He said ''Your partner did this.'' I looked at him, not knowing what to say. Before I could get a word in, he continued ''His wife, daughter, his face, everything. He did this himself. With a mirror piec-'' I bashed his head to the wall. That fucker was lying, and I knew it. He was lying to me at a time like this? How fucking dare he? I left that place in rage and didn't even hear what the worker said as I was leaving.

28.8.2012
I'm still angry at that worker. How could he say something like that? Killing your own family, doing that to your face? And his daughter... My partner would never do that. I will find the killer and I will make him pay.  I'm going to his apartment today to see if I find anything on the crime scene.

It's now afternoon. I found a few notebooks there. It seems he was keeping a diary to help with his investigation, just like me. They were labeled after some cases he had worked on, and one of them was labeled ''The mirror murder''. It was the case he was working on when he died. I read some of what was written the notebook, and found out he had visited and old man called ''Rick'' before his death. The address was there, so I will go to him as soon as I can. I need some time to deal with all this.

1.9.2012
I went to see that old man today. While I was driving there I saw this old house that was pretty close to the one I was visiting. I got a bad feeling from looking at the house and felt like something was calling me there. When I got to Rick, I introduced myself and asked him if anyone lived in that house. He said another police had come some time ago and asked that same question. I knew who he was talking about. He then continued to explain there was nobody living in the house, and that no one had lived there for over a year now. I told him I'd come back later, and went to that house. When I was leaving, Rick said something like ''don't go''. But I had to. Inside the house it smelled bad. I found some birds and a cat lying dead in one of the rooms. It made me kinda sick, but I kept going and proceeded upstairs. There were three rooms, and one of them had a mirror in it (picture here http://i.imgur.com/piXEBkF.jpg). My partner's notes mentioned it too. Here's the clip that speaks of the mirror: 

''*The mirror is cracked and blurry. The gold edges are stained with what looks like blood, and I swear I can hear voices from behind the mirror. I'm really creeped out and don't want to stay here any longer, but this place is the only clue the diary holds. So far everything it said has been true, and I even found the dead crows. I'm going to go talk to that guy Rick again and see if he knows more about this place. Hearing the story of this mirror has really gotten to me. I swear I can hear a little girl crying for help now.*''

After reading that I went to Rick again. He told me my partner hadn't come to see him again, and had just left in a hurry. I'm genuinely scared right now. I can feel someone watching me.

2.9.2012
I just woke up from a bad nightmare. It was the face of my partner screaming inside that mirror. Behind him stood a man with no eyes and three cuts on his face (positioned just like the ones on my partners corpse. One on the left eye, one on the mouth and one on the right cheek). I decided to read his diary a bit further. I'm not sure if this is a joke, but I'm really scared now. I can't sleep, so I'm gonna take some sleeping pills after I'm done writing this. I hear knocking. This is what he wrote in his notes:

''*The mirror is in my house. I can't fucking believe this. I'm too scared to touch it, I hear them inside me, screaming. I'm afraid for my family. I dreamed that I was doing horrible things last night. That man is in my head. It's that mirror. It's that goddamn mirror. I need to get rid of it before my family comes home.*''

I don't have the strenght to go on anymore. I read his notes. All of them. He did it. He did it and he wrote it all down like some fucking psycho. That morgue guy was right. Even his own daughter...he raped his own family and killed them. I can't take it, there's no point to go on in my investigation. Here is the last few senteces he wrote. I can't seem to make sense of them and my head hurts. I can see and hear all these people every time I close my eyes.

''*I've killed them...my family...that dream happened. Everything I saw in that dream happened and I just watched myself do these horrible things to my family..even after they died. The mirror is evil. It made me do it, and it made me cut myself. It burns, it burns so much it's hard to see, but I see people around me. They're just a blur but I can see it's my family and some other people. A man with no eyes and his son, a girl who cant be older than 15 and her mother. And that man.*''

This is the end of a text file found on the computer of a man who confessed to murdering his wife and two children. He was found face cut in a river by two police officers on a patroll. He was sent to prison for life, but he soon bit his own tongue and died. A mirror was found in the appartment, and apparently he used a piece of it to commit the murders and cut his own face.

There is one exception to the buildings still standing and not having been restored. It is a small manor, called by the locals ""The House of 44 Ravens"", at the end of Bassett Road on hill beyond a rusted iron wrought gate. Unlike most of the other buildings, the manor is extraordinarily extravagant with its forty-four carved statues of ravens, for which the manor is named for. The house though it has been declared condemned, has also been called a historical site and thus it has not been torn down. 

I shudder as I recall the local legend about the man who used to own the manor, one Mr. Timothy Van Buren, and the fate that befell the manor. 

Has the legend goes, Mr. Van Buren was obsessed with ravens to the point of near-worship. There had been reports of the man climbing into trees looking for the nests of ravens to steal the eggs and incubate them, and each time one of the birds he raised died (whether he killed them or not is a subject up for debate amongst the town), he would commission the local sculptor, Howard Poe, to carve from granite a statue of the particular raven. Has the story goes, Mr. Van Buren commissioned the forty third raven to be sculpted, and upon its completion, Mr. Poe brought the bust to the property. 

Several months later, Mr. Van Buren had found, and hatched the forty fourth raven. Through a practiced eye, Mr. Van Buren knew this bird was going to be larger and much stronger than all the others he had raised. He was so elated that he went to the town pub, got drunk, and was reported staggering through the streets singing, ""Finally! He has come! The Raven Lord has arrived!"" He raised this raven for seven months before the fire broke out in his house.

It was a rather dry summer that year, so it is no wonder why the fire broke out in the first place. Most people believe that the fire broke out in the study room, because Mr. Van Buren had left a candle too close to some documents and he perished in the fire, and that is the official story. The, unofficial story, is that Mr. Van Buren set the place on fire intentionally himself in a strange and weird ritual to the Raven Lord. 

There are only two facts supporting this statement. Fact number one: no human body was recovered from the fire. Fact number two: That night, several witnesses claimed to have seen a giant raven with a wing span of fifty feet and terrible red eyes rise from the smoke, though the officials at the time simply stated that it was just their imagination.

The mayor asked Mr. Poe to sculpt the forty fourth and final raven in both honor of Mr. Van Buren and the raven he so dearly loved.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_10oiij,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/10oiij/the_house_of_44_ravens/,

“Hey, Dillon” Said my brother Kyle as I flicked on the T.V. I turned my head to him. “Turn it to the news; some crazy shit happened earlier a few miles away.” As he requested I changed the channel to the news. A typical reporter standing in front of a camera appears mid sentence. “-cident occurred near the town of High River, where two teenagers were found dead. Witnesses say that before the “attack” there was a third friend with them, but is now missing. Recent reports say that the bodies were brutally attacked by wild animals, perhaps a pack of wolves. No tracks have been able to confirm this theory due to the heavy rain the past few days.” 

The television screen then showed the bodies. The corpses of two kids, about fifteen or sixteen years old, were horrifically mangled, lying in grass just outside of a wooded area. The limbs appeared to be barely hanging on by a few tendons. Besides that, the heads of all of the carcasses all shared a similar trait, missing pieces of them. Literally, chucks of the bodies were gone, no teeth marks, just gone. My brother and I stared in awe at the sight, our jaws open. I look over to Kyle and ask, “How the hell does a pack of wolves do that to three kids?” He shrugs at me. “Maybe the wolves were on steroids, and pissed that its balls shrunk.” He snickered. “That thing come by my house, I kill it.” I told my brother in my best redneck impression. “Yeah, sure you will.” He replied. “Hey, Kyle?” I asked him. “Yeah?” he replied. “Aren’t supposed to be getting Keagan here pretty quick?” “Oh, shit yeah” Kyle replied, “By the way, when did Mom and Dad say they were getting home?” “Tomorrow, around 7 Pm” I answered. “Ok, I`m going to get Keagan now.” Kyle said. As he walked out the door leading to the backyard, he called our dog to let it go outside, “Peanut!” Our dog ran out the door and went on to play with our other dog. 

~

It`s about 9:30 PM, the three of us, Keagan, Kyle and I, decided to see what happened to the three kids. Upon arrival to the area, we jumped out of the car, clicked on our flashlights and started our search. Through long grass trees we found the scene of the animal attack. Having not noticing the gruesome sight at first, the stench of the blood and something else made me vomit at a glance of it. “Hey, Keagan!” I called, “Kyle!” They both rushed over, their flashlights beaming through the dark. “Did you find something?” Keagan asked. Still gagging through the stench, I manage to say “Yeah, but it reeks of ass and only the blood is left.” “So what exactly happened here?” He asked, “I didn`t watch the news report.” Kyle told him, “A few kids were apparently attacked by a pack of wolves, two corpses were found, and one kids body wasn’t found.” While Kyle continued to explain what happened I shined my flashlight at the trees about 30 metres away to look through them. To my surprise, someone, something was looking back at me. In the trees glowed two orbs back at me. The thing creeped up slowly, almost curious. It was on all fours as it skulked, while it was doing that I slowly made my way to Keagan and Kyle and pointed them in the direction of the creature. Trying to see it better, we all aimed our flashlights at it. We all stood motionless, waiting for it to do something. Kyle whispered with shock in his voice, “What the fuck is that?”
	
When it got to about five yards away it stood up on two feet. It stood at 6 feet with little fur at all; it resembled a decomposing bear carcass with patches of fur and muscle desperately clinging to it flesh. In between its shoulders is a horse skull, in replacement for its jaw, hung an unusually large canine jaw. On its hands were individual claws with joints like fingers. It roared a blood shrieking noise; it felt as if the ground shook from how loud it is. One of the beams of light directed at it stopped and fell. 
	
Kyle ran, and I mean he fucking booked it. He ran directly behind us. The creature that was staring at us ran after him quickly changing from standing from two, to four legs. When it chased after him I was in the way, but that didn`t stop it. It bulldozed over me like I was nothing, making me black out. 
	
I woke up a few moments later with Keagan was dragging me back to the car. I looked back with blurry vision, my eyesight returned a few seconds later. I regret even looking at what I saw next. Kyle was lying on the ground with the beast standing on his back. The thing grabbed his arms and with the sound of bones cracking and Kyle screaming, his arms were cleaved in two. We finally got the car, luckily the doors were unlocked. He dragged me into the passenger seat and ran into the drivers seat. He reached into both of his pockets. “Fuck! Dillon, where`s the keys?” He shouted at me. “Kyle has them; maybe you can go ask him for them!” I shouted back. 
	
“Well, I`m going to have to get them from him.” he stated. The monster that killed Kyle disappeared, nowhere in sight. “I think it’s gone.” I told him. Keagan took a deep breath and quietly got out of the car. When he got about halfway from Kyles corpse and the car, the beast rushed out from the trees tackling Keagan. The thing ripped a hole in his chest, grabbing onto his rib cage and pulling it out. I sat inside the car, staring in fear at what`s happening. But my heart sank when it saw me inside the car. It walked towards the car; on its face I could see a grin. It shook its head when it got to ten feet away. Its head busted through the window, gripping my head with its jaws. It jerked its head back out, tossing me out the car. While I was on the ground I realized that my body was still in the car. Then everything faded into black, and I felt at peace.

 I’ve lived here since I was born, to this day. It had 5 bedrooms; 2 bathrooms; a kitchen; a cellar; 2 living rooms… and an attic. All of my life, especially in my adolescent stages, I always feared the attic… It had a vent that hung down, in the next room from my bedroom. I swear, every night I would hear whispers, and laughs. I always convinced myself I was just hearing things, until this one night.
	I was lying in my bed, texting on my new iPhone I got for my 17th birthday, when I heard a coarse gagging sound from the next room. I jumped back and stared, to what I thought looked like a human crawling, covered in blood, with hair in its face. My heart pounded, because I knew this wasn’t a hallucinogenic figure. This was real. It crawled across my floor coughing and moaning. I screamed and grabbed my phone, I pulled it up and began to dial 911, but I saw its face past my phone’s light. It peered into my eyes, whispering “true fear is known in some, but the rest are…” then I passed out.
	I woke up at 3:00 AM to a scream. I ran down stairs as fast as I could, and found my mother lying on the floor… dead. I saw bloody footprints leading into my parent’s bedroom, then out into my little brother’s bedroom. Then I heard his cries. I started to ball as I curled up in fetal position. Then the human crawled at me, head notching in every direction, whispering “but the rest are prone to loss”

Now, this one wasn't your typical nutcase. This guy was twisted in a whole new way, by the end he was known locally as the modern day mad monk. Now, this guy had a thing for literature. File said he was locked up after he ran out of things to write on and carved up his family. I saw the photos, bodies half rotten covered in words just gouged into the flesh with fingernails. And this guy himself, died scratching words into his chest with a spoon. 

So, we get here and, wouldn't you bet, this place was creepy as hell. Nobody had touched it since the 40's when all the freakjobs got transferred to state penn. We'd all seen stuff like this before, chipped paint and rusty wheelchares make great television after all. We weren't ready to see his room. The walls were covered. I mean covered in writing. Words written over words again and again, some written in pen, others in ancient food smeared out. In places some words had turned a brown colour, we didn't want to think what these words were written in. It was strange, staring at all the words. None of it made any kind of sense, sentences would mingle together and twist off into elaborate patterns. Looking at it for too long your head would start to pound.

So we set up our usual gear. Cameras here a fan or two just out of frame there, the whole deal. The usual play was we walk around in the dark and act scared shitless. So we all go walkabout but one girl, new hire, Jenna. I guess, I think she was a boom operator? She latched onto that room. Said it was something about the atmosphere that she couldn't let go of. I only checked in on her once. She was sat on the floor legs crossed staring into the wall, all of those words, like they were staring right back at her. I don't know, maybe they were. I remember I tried to check up on her, placed a hand on her shoulder. Jerked half out of her goddamn skin like she'd seen a ghost. Shame I didn't get it on tape really. After that I left her to her wall. Left a camera in there with her since she was the only one who wanted to spend time in that tiny little cell and left her to it. That was my biggest mistake. 

It was another hour before we heard hide nor tail of little Jenna. When we did we wished we didn't. We found her in the pitch black, huddled against a wall, just...Just screaming. I'd never heard something so horrifying and piercing as the noises she made. Took just under an hour to calm her down. After that she went full catatonic, wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't talk to the crew not a word. That wasn't the worst thing though. I was the first to find them, the markings. She'd used a hairpin. A goddamn hairpin to cut her flesh. The words looked all too familiar. 

So, I don't know. I don't believe in ghosts. Never have. Not so much possession either. I think it was the wall. Seeing her just sat there staring into all of those words, all of that suffering, all that, that madness scrawled onto the walls. Maybe that's what made her snap. It wasn't until after someone took her pin off of her that she decided our other cast needed some extra body art. I read the reports from back then, our modern day mad monk killed several orderlies just for some extra writing space. He'd pin them down first, they never died quickly. He would bleed them from the words carved onto their bodies. I came to this shithole with a crew of seven. Now there are only two of us left. It's been five hours now and Jenna... She's still pounding on the door. I've managed to seal myself in here. No way in hell is she getting through that door. The thing is, I don't think it would matter either way, of all the cells I could have sealed myself in after she turned. How many must there be, five hundred? A thousand? Out of all of those I had to seal myself in the same cell as her.

I've been in here longer than she was. Even as I write this I can...Feel them, the words. It's still all nonsense. But, every now and then, I'll look up and see lines jump out at me. Just another scrawled line that holds just a little more meaning. Not sense, you see. Meaning. I don't see the full picture yet but it's coming to me. It's beautiful, really. The words, they all fold together and twist and turn in the most beautiful poetry  imaginable and every second I read the more the pattern unfolds. 

I think I said something, a long time ago, about why we write things. Why I've been writing this down for nobody to read. Why the last inhabitant of this little room wrote all of this. I don't know, I don't think anyone should know. That would ruin it, the poetry of it. I also realise that nobody is going to read these last few lines. I realise that I ran out of paper to write on over an hour ago.

1337275814.0,15,self.creepypasta,trxdg,Jack’s Back ,saggypeanuts98,19,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/trxdg/jacks_back/,"I first got in contact with Jack, my former landlord, a little over a year ago when I answered his newspaper ad. I was in a rush to move out as I had just broken up with my significant other, whom I shared an apartment with, and Jack was renting out the furnished basement of his house. The location was good and the price was a steal, and I moved in with a few boxes of personal items four days later.

The house was old and the floors were creaky – Jack was the eternal bachelor, interested in nothing but cars, certainly not interior decorating or hardly even basic upkeep for that matter – and when he got up to go to work at 5 A.M. he would often wake me up, since I am a very light sleeper. However, as the months passed by I got accustomed to waking up early.

I cannot tell you the exact moment I realized that something wasn’t right.

Over a number of days, a thought slowly crept into my conscious mind and settled; I hadn’t heard very much noise from upstairs lately. There was the occasional creak or bang, like in all older houses, but the heavy footsteps that I woke up to and sometimes heard during the evening had seemed to disappear completely. Perhaps Jack was sick, I thought. Perhaps he hadn’t worked in a few days, perhaps he worked different hours. The man was a real loner and kept to himself, so it honestly didn’t seem strange to me. I only really talked to him when I went upstairs to give him his rent money on the first of every month. He was never unfriendly or rude, but short with me, didn’t have much to say.

I looked out the window and saw that the light was on in the garage. The blinds were closed, but someone was moving around in there. Jack must be working on his car. I felt relieved. His car was his baby – a powerhouse customized from scratch in the body of a 1930′s Ford. He’d shown it to me once. It was still just barely drivable but had already won prizes. He spent all his free time working on it.

The last couple of days the truck that he drove to work had been sitting in the driveway when I left in the morning, but the following day it was gone. That same evening, the new noises started.

It was around 5 P.M. I was on my computer, when from upstairs I heard what could only be described as shuffling. Like something covered in cloth was being dragged across the floor in short bursts. Then the sound of something heavy, like a big dresser, being moved. More shuffling. I heard the phone ring multiple times, but nobody picked up. A few minutes later, I could hear Jack slam the front door shut and walk towards the garage. As he passed by my window, I looked outside.

Now, I have to say that Jack was not a man who cared a great deal about the way he looked – his hair was grey and disheveled, his clothes often had holes and oil stains and I had never seen him even remotely close to clean shaven – but this, this was different. There was something unnerving about his gait, but I couldn’t put my finger on what exactly was wrong. Arms hanging at his sides, he was looking up into the sky. I couldn’t see his face, but for a moment it looked like his mouth was wide, wide open… was that his tongue bulging out, swollen and black? No, of course not, it couldn’t be…

I closed the curtains and locked my door. Never before had Jack frightened me.

That night, I woke up from screaming upstairs. Not frightened screams, or calls for help, but angry. A man’s voice, loud, shouting in rage. I couldn’t make out any words. Was it Jack? I stumbled out of bed and fumbled around in the dark for my clothes. Not really knowing what to expect, I looked around for something to defend myself with, and grabbed a knife from the kitchen. With shaking hands I called the police on my cell, ran upstairs and beat my fist against the door.

There was no answer. The house was dark and silent. Jack’s truck was there in the driveway, cold, sleeping. After a little while a police patrol drove by, and I talked to the officers briefly in the driveway, but they left after looking around outside and not finding anything out of the ordinary. Useless cops. So useless. I turned around, and the house loomed in front of me like only houses in the dark can. I thought I saw movement behind a curtain.

After an hour or so I crawled back into bed. I did not sleep. I just laid there, quiet as a mouse in the dark with my covers up to my eyeballs, listening for any noise or movement upstairs.

There was only silence.

Thankfully, I was not scheduled to work the next day. It was late summer and a lovely day, but I was afraid to go outside. I did not hear Jack all day – however, the phone rang multiple times. Nobody picked up. I spent the day with millions of thoughts running through my head, jumping at every little sound the house produced, kitchen knife never out of reach. Had there been a knock on my door that day I would probably have suffered a fatal heart attack.

Nightfall brought a sense of despair. I did not see anyone walking by my window that evening, but through my curtains I saw the lights come on in the garage. I started to wonder whether I was losing my mind.

Sleep came late, and when it did, it was filled with terrible dreams. It was one of those long nightmares that you never really seem to be able to get out of. In my dream, Jack was standing by my bed, looking down at me. I remember his face – foreign, cold, filling me with a deep feeling of dread. And then, something had roused me from my sleep. I looked up and that lingering feeling of dread escalated into paralysing fear, violently wedging an icy spear into my spine – because for a few terrifying seconds Jack was right there, mouth open so impossibly wide, like a ghostly image burned into my retinas from looking into bright light. I screamed, and the vision faded away. Just then, as if something upstairs had heard me scream, a response came in the form of a heavy thump. Something rolled across the floor. I think I cried.

Looking back, I think that was the turning point for me. Everything about this was so, so wrong and I couldn’t continue letting this happen, whatever it was. I needed to not be scared anymore. This needed to end. When dawn finally came after what seemed like an eternity, I looked outside and felt my heart skip a beat when I saw something moving around in the lit garage. This was it. It had to happen now. I needed to know the truth. I grabbed my trusty kitchen knife and climbed out my bedroom window, which was not visible from the garage.

Crouching, I sneaked around to the front door and held my breath as I turned the smudged brass knob. It wouldn’t budge – the door was locked. Is it possible to be both relieved and disappointed at once? My sweaty hand tightened around the handle of the knife as I went around the side of the house. Adrenaline was coursing through my veins, eyes in the back of my head like a startled deer. Please-don’t-let-him-see-me-please-don’t-let-him-see-me.

The kitchen window was open. It was open… I still remember every terrible detail so clearly. After picking together the last bits of courage I could muster, I stood up and looked inside. The fluorescent light over the sink was on. I could see that the refrigerator door was slightly ajar.

Then… The smell. That awful, disgusting stench, wafting out through that window slit. And there, on the floor, next to the broken dishes… God help me.

I did not go back inside. I didn’t stay. I drove away, and I called the police from my car. I did not want to gamble on that thing, whatever it was, staying put in the garage until the police arrived. I drove until I was too tired to drive any further, then I pulled in on a side road and slept.

I never went back to the house.

A few days later, I found the article in the local newspaper. It stated that a 58-year old man had been found dead in his home on 112th and Dunsmuir. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was going to be performed. Foul play had been ruled out, however. The coroner estimated that the man had been dead for about three weeks before he was found by his tenant. It also spoke of some unusual findings around the property, especially in the unattached garage, but I did not read any further.

The worst part is, sometimes when I wake up I can still see Jack standing beside my bed, draped like a blanket over something far more dark and sinister.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_trxdg,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/trxdg/jacks_back/,

It's no secret that modern technology is a marvelous thing. We can record, store, and recall immense quantities of data, using the great machines we call computers. They're compact, powerful, and fast to a degree that is often difficult to understand. We have seen them undergo incredible improvements at a phenomenal speed.

Take, for example, the good old Commodore 64. Released in 1982, it was considered a gem in the world of computers, with a blazing fast 0.98 Mhz processor. Let's not neglect to mention its floppy drive system, which imbued it with 170 kilobytes of storage! Of course...it is now the year 2012, and computers have come a long way. Japan's K-Computer now has a processing speed of over 8 petaflops. It's so fast that the old system of measuring processing speed, Ghz, had to be largely abandoned. Meanwhile, a company called Cray is building the Blue Waters Supercomputer, which will feature 500 petabytes of storage.

There is, however, one piece of technology that, for now, surpasses even these behemoth computers, and that is the human brain. The brain's storage, estimated at 2.5 petabytes, has already been surpassed, however, it's processing speed and algorithms have not. The brain operates differently than a computer, you see. While computers think in a linear fashion, all 1's and 0's, the human mind has a 3 dimensional thought scheme, yielding exponentially more neural connections than a computer can even compete with.

Where am I going with all this, you may ask? It is the nature of humankind to improve things. In the insignificant span of 30 years, the computer has improved exponentially. They are now millions of times more powerful than before. However, computers are not the only thing we humans will wish to improve. Inevitably, our computers will surpass the power of the human mind, and we will fall to our temptations. Why should we suffer a feeble organic mind, prone to errors and eventual death, when we can simply upload our minds, personalities, emotions, and all onto a computer? While many say this is impossible, computer parts are already being integrated into the human body, and our scientists believe that the opposite will be possible in as little as 60 years.

Still not seeing a problem, are you? The new you, a computer with everything you are, will far surpass you. With a processing speed rivaling that of light itself, how long do you think it will be before you go through every possible thought and emotion the mind could have ever had? A minute? Two?

How long do you think it will be before you decide, with perfect logic, that you would rather skip floating aimlessly through an eternity that is as cold and empty as you now are? Take a look over at your computer now, and mind the power button...

Charlie spat the toothpick out of his mouth, it landed carelessly on the slimy deck of the dredge barge they were on. Dean paused momentarily, lifted one gloved hand up and backwards, middle finger fully extended, before reaching back down and grabbing the line close to the water. He yanked hard on the brown stained rope, and with herculean effort, hoisted the taut line upwards and looped it over the pulley winch. 

""Bought fucking time."" Charlie swore as he slapped the large green button on the winch's console. An electric motor kicked on behind them and the rope began steadily pulling out of the muck and fed into a nearby covered housing. 

Dean stood back and wiped the back of his arm against his sweating brow, the back of his dirty glove slid across his forehead, leaving a dull red streak there. He began hearing distinct voices in his ear. 

*Join us, Be us, We are one, Drink, You will be one* 

Dean looked down at the back of his glove, noticing the dark stains on it. He turned to Charlie.""Hey Chuck, do I got any of this sh...""

""Yeah man."" Charlie interrupted. ""Here."" He said as he leaned over to a bucket at his feet, retrieving a clean white cloth and tossing it to Dean. 

Dean used the cloth and wiped his face with it. Immediately the voices softened to a hushed whisper.

*Drink, come*

""Are they bad?"" Charlie asked.

""Nah man, Just a smear. Not even enough to make me thirsty."" Dean answered. He paused for a moment, before speaking up again. ""Actually, do we have any Cokes left?""

""Department can't afford them anymore. We got three cans of Ginger Ale and then we're down to drip bags."" 

""I'm not drinking horse juices. throw me an Ale. We need to pick up a pack of Uricycles tonight."" Dean commented as he cracked open the can and took a generous swig. 

A metallic rattling noise drew their attention to the side of the riverbank. A gaunt, nearly naked figure was digging furiously at the chain link fence that ran the entire length of the Hudson river inside city limits. The man's upper body was caked with dried and fresh blood, flowing from what remained of his shattered fingers after desperately clawing at the wire fence all night long. The metal links were bent and twisted in places, but still intact. Looking up and down the fence, they could see countless spots that looked just like it; Bent and twisted links smeared with a ruddy brown color along an otherwise unchanging gleaming wall of metal as far as the eye could see in both directions. 

""Call it in?"" Charlie asked. 

""Fuck it. Won't do that poor bastard any good anyway. Never seen em come back from the urge when they're like that."" Dean responded morosely. ""He'll slit his wrists to drink his own blood if they lock him down. Besides, APHK don't do individual pickups anymore."" 

Dean wondered if there was any point to the madness that the world had been reduced to. Every natural water source in the world contaminated at the same time. The survivors of humanity reduced to living off of whatever liquids and fluids that had been bottled, canned, or stored before ""C day"". 

As if to emphasize the point, they watched a pretty young teenage girl a bit further down the canal squeeze underneath a heavily damaged section of the fence. She emerged on their side bleeding from multiple scratches and furrows in her skin and clothing. Her simple yellow t-shirt was ripped along the front, exposing a single breast to the two men as they drifted past. Uncaring and with a joyous smile, she walked down to the river bank and waded into the thick muck with outstretched arms, quickly disappearing beneath top layer of blood and decomposing flesh. 

""Shame."" Charlie said, reaching into his front pocket and extracting a small container of vapor rub. He used it to apply a small layer of the fragrent gel underneath his nose as the winch reached the end of the line and hundreds of dead, rotting bodies began sliding up onto the barge inside their repurposed trawling net. 

Dean grabbed his hook pole and snagged the body of a small child that was starting to slip off the boat. He manuevered it back into the fresh catch slowly moving towards the mountain of corpses already piled high on the barge. His mind briefly touched again on the futility of it all, knowing deep down that governmental supplies of sodas, bottled water, and canned goods were dwindling fast, and the Urine Recycling plants could only function for so long. Assuming one could avoid any rainstorms, eventually they'd be driven mad from dehydration. Ten years, maybe twenty, there'd be no one left to haul his bloated corpse out of the small runoff pond next to his house. He shook his head to clear the tiny whispers quickly fading to nothing as the remaining moisture evaporated off his skin in the hot sun.

My friends stayed the night at my house, as we saw some fireworks the night before. We stayed up all night and it was about 7 o'clock. We couldn't find anything to watch, so I just decided to flip through the channels to see what was on. I see Disney Junior, and think why not? We like to poke fun at kid’s shows, so we thought it would be funny. What I did next was the biggest mistake of my life.
	
I click on Disney Junior, and the show on is Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. I figured, “Eh, why not? I’ll probably fall asleep soon.” The episode is Minnie’s Picnic. I’ve saw this before. I used to watch all these silly shows when I would wake up early because nothing was on. So the episode started out like I remember it, Mickey and friends were getting ready to go to a picnic. 
	
But something was off. I couldn’t really put my finger on it; something was bugging me. Then it hit me. Pete wasn’t with them. Pete normally walks out of the closet with a picnic blanket before they leave the house, but he didn’t. They didn’t have a blanket. They chose to forget him.
	
They had the picnic like they did in the actual episode, then they head back to the clubhouse (probably to do the hot dog dance). When they get to the clubhouse, there is no dancing. No music. Just the sound of me and my friends breathing across the room. They walk to the closet and open the door. A mangled body falls down. You couldn’t tell who it was, if it wasn’t for the overalls that it wore. Pete wore those overalls. His legs were completely gone, and he had bite marks all over him. The blood was too hyper-realistic for my friend. He ran in the bathroom and threw up. 
	
Mickey and Goofy drag what was left of Pete to a backroom that I never seemed to notice in the other episodes. When they opened the door, we were in shock. There were several other characters hanging up; mangled, torn to pieces. My friend was done. He ran out the door and was never heard from again. 
	It was only me left. They hung Pete up and slammed the door. I couldn’t take anymore of this. I shut off the TV and tried to go to sleep. I couldn’t, seeing what I just saw.
	
A few days later, after the image of Pete and the other mangled bodies cleared from my mind, I tried to search the episode up on Google, but I found nothing. I am now scared of Mickey Mouse and all the other Disney characters and can’t go on my family’s  annual trip to Disney World. This episode has truly ruined my life. If you do stumble across it please do not watch it.

She sat on the couch, grey-eyed and balefully beautiful, watching me stare intently at the candle on her mantelpiece.

“It’s gorgeous,” I croaked.  It looked like a jar filled with a shimmering fluid more than an actual flame.  My fingers hovered a few inches above the closed lid, “May I?”

Her half smile was quiet.  “Be careful,” she almost hummed.

Picking the jar up, I watched the contents slosh gently against the sides.  It wasn’t a candle at all.  I looked at her, questioning.

“Liquid light,” she explained, “all but forgotten in the bright morning of its capture but immeasurably valued in the midnight darkness.”

The jar was warm to the touch, but not hot.  I reached to unscrew the lid.

“Hm,” she disapproved gently.

I looked at her, my hands frozen in place on the container and casting jiggling pools of shadow across her face.  She did not break eye contact, but said no more.  The lid slid off, and the opened jar began to whisper audibly.  I looked at her, perplexed.  “If you’re going to open it, then at least listen,” she mouthed.

I put my ear to the jar’s opening.  A child’s voice reached out to me, quiet.  “Help me,” it breathed.  The woman cleared her throat, and I awoke.

Finding myself in my bed, it took a long moment to realize it had been a dream, and a longer one still to come to terms with the loss of what the grey-eyed woman had been going to say next.  After another moment, the feeling slid away from me, and seeing that the clock next to my bed read 3:47, I rolled over and fell back asleep.

Thud.

The shovel had thickly struck wood.  A very large man clapped me on the back and boomed from behind a thick beard, “Ah!  So the laddie had some backbone to throw into it after all, boys!”  It was only when a cheer answered this statement that I noticed the rest of the pirates, a dozen men standing waist-deep in half-dug holes ranged around mine.  They promptly scrambled out of their own excavations and began clearing sand from the heavy chest I had uncovered.  When they had hoisted the box carefully up to ground level, the captain crept lightly forward and lifted the lid.  There had been no lock.

I could see a brilliant glow from inside the treasure chest, but I could not actually see what was producing it.  The captain reached inside and scooped out a single, brilliant glass jar.  I gasped with recognition, suddenly realizing I was in another dream.  I waited, wanting to hear what the pirate had to say about the golden liquid.

“Hm?” he said, noticing my reaction, “Recognize this?”  He jerked his head toward the jar.

I nodded.  “Liquid light.”

A roar of laughter met my words.  “Liquid light?” the captain mocked.  Turning to his men, he added, “Perhaps the boy isn’t so savvy as he seemed.”  This elicited more mirth than my errant pronouncement had.  

“No, lad,” the pirate went on, turning back toward me, “this ain’t no light, and it ain’t no candle, neither.  This is nothing less than the pure, distilled essence of gold.  More valuable than any mere ore; why, this jar alone is worth more than the Crown could part with, and there are dozens more here.”

I wanted to hear if there was a voice in this jar, too, but I knew the captain would never just hand one over.  Unfortunately for him, this happened to be my dream.  And when you know you’re dreaming, you may as well be a god.  I reached out, and the jar jumped out of his hand, floating toward mine.  Taken by surprise, he unsheathed his sword with a growl.

I glanced at him and jumped lightly into the air, hovering just off the ground for a long moment before flying just out of the blade’s reach.  I unscrewed the jar and listened to it like a seashell.

The same little boy’s distressed voice greeted me.  “Please.  Help me, help us,” it murmured over and over. 

“Who are you?”  I asked, desperate to use my dream-powers to help.  I felt a weight drop into my pocket.  Reaching in, I retrieved an old, beaten piece of parchment, a treasure map.  Unfolding it, I was surprised to find a modern-looking street map on the inside.  I gazed for a moment at the crossing streets, noting a large black “X” drawn over one of the intersections.  

When I awoke, I quickly sketched the map from memory onto a notepad I kept on my nightstand before the pirate-dream’s details slipped from my head.

The next day dawned bright as the essence of gold.  I awoke, and looking about, my eye fell on the map-sketch I had made the night before, and the grey-eyed woman and the pirates swam back to me.  I could hear the little boy’s voice as vividly as I had in the dream.  I briefly wondered if someone was trying to reach out to me from the other side, but I shook this feeling off quickly, not even really knowing what I meant by “the other side.”  Still, I kept thinking about the little boy and his map throughout the day.  I kept looking at the map I had drawn; I was unable to recognize the shape of the area it depicted, but something about it rang familiar.  I felt silly for half-expecting to recognize it, but by the time I went to bed that evening, I had almost, but not quite, put the issue out of my mind.

Whoosh.

The wind rushed past my head.  I was tumbling, free-falling in pitch blackness.  I screamed as I fell through the icy air, seeing nothing.  After a moment, several more screams, and a futile attempt to gain any sense of my bearings, I saw a flash of light.  Another moment, another midair flip, and I saw it again.  I thought for a moment that I was seeing the moon each time my body turned over itself, but the third time I saw the light, I recognized as one of my dream jars.  Flooded with relief at the realization that this was yet another dream, I steadied myself in the air with a thought and called the jar to me.  It smacked into my palm with a satisfying, warm solidness.  I looked around, but I couldn’t see anything but air in the tiny sphere of illumination that the jar provided.

I eagerly unscrewed the top, and this time light burst out of the jar along with the whispering, urgent voice, illuminating the whole world.  I saw a tangle of huge buildings below me.  I did not recognize them until I noticed the Statue of Liberty off to my right.  I was hanging, motionless, in the air above Manhattan.  I listened close to the jar, and the boy’s voice, more urgent even than before, said, “It’s here…help us…it’s here…”  As he said this, I realized that the map I’d drawn from the last dream had been of the island below me.  

It is possible, I learned on the tarmac the next day, to board an airplane sheepishly.  My only consolation was the fact that no one on the plane knew that I was going to New York to literally pursue a dream.  I glanced at the map I kept on my lap.  A Google search conducted on waking up that morning had led me to the address that the “X” denoted.  The building, as far as I could tell, was an old warehouse, well away from the nicer parts of the Borough.  I dryly hoped that I wasn’t about to get myself actually killed following these stupid dreams.

My initial impression had been correct.  The building was in a terrible location.  I could just see it at the end of street I was walking down.  As I reached it, I saw that the door had been left ajar.  Either the building was completely derelict, or someone knew I was coming.

I pushed the door open and stepped inside.  It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the gloom.  In front of me was a staircase headed downward.  A faint glow rose from the floors below.  I started down, and as I descended I began to hear faint shouts and the whirring of machinery.  The light grew steadily brighter.

At the bottom of the staircase lay some sort of factory.  Small, sickly children ran between rows of huge machines.  The light was coming from a conveyor belt which carried hundreds and hundreds of the dream jars.  Could this all have been a dream?  I wondered to myself.

“You’re going to need this,” said a voice from near my elbow.  I recognized it at once as the boy who whispered through the jars.  He was holding one towards me, offering it.  Unlike the brilliantly shining others, this jar was filled with a murky and dull yellow liquid.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Nightmare,” came the simple reply.  The boy tugged at my sleeve, pulling me behind one of the larger machines.  “My name is Yusef.  Thank you for coming here.  We need you.”

“What is this place?” I asked, dumbfounded.

“The factory.  This is where we manufacture dreams,” came the reply.

“So the light in the jars—“

“—are dreams,” Yusef finished.  “Not liquid light or distilled gold,” he added.

I took a moment and really looked at the boy for the first time.  He was thin—too thin, badly thin—and I could see scars running up the length of his forearms, disappearing under his sleeves.  He couldn’t be older than nine or ten.

He saw me staring.  “Things in the factory…are not good.”

At that moment, a loud voice boomed over the heads of the scurrying children, unintelligible.  I couldn’t see the man who was yelling, but I could hear the whip crack and the pathetic yelps that followed the voice.  This wasn’t a factory for dreams—it was a sweatshop.  

I turned to Yusef.  “So you—“

“—write and deliver your dreams?  Yes.  A few days ago, I wanted out of here so badly that I just whispered for help into one of the jars.  When I realized you’d heard me, I told you how to get here,” he explained, trembling, “you have to help us get out of here.”

A very large hand clapped my shoulder.  “Who is this!?” its owner yelled fiercely.  Looking up, startled, I recognized the foreman who had found me as the model for the pirate captain Yusef had sent me.  I looked at the nightmare in my hand, unscrewed the lid, and dumped the contents onto the man’s head.  He fell to the floor, gasping at private terrors. 

I looked at Yusef.  “Good one, got any more?”  I asked. 

The boy wordlessly produced a sack of the things.  I grabbed one in each hand, stood up, and shouted to the children, “Upstairs, everyone!  Let’s go home!”  They didn’t need to be told twice.  As the children dropped their tools and ran upwards toward freedom, Yusef and I stayed behind, nightmares in hand, to cover their escape.  To my surprise, only three more men came out of the woodworks to pursue the fleeing children.  Yusef and I each felled one with a thrown nightmare, but the third closed the gap too quickly for us and grabbed me by the throat, whip in hand.  With a look, I sent Yusef scampering up the stairs after the others.

Determined to recapture the little escapee, the man dropped me and bolted for the staircase.  I followed.  As he mounted the first step, I stuck a foot between his, tripping him.  He fell face-first, hard, into the staircase.  I jumped over him, took the stairs, and was out the door in a moment.  He followed, but stopped short at the door.  I stood on the street with the children in broad daylight.  He moved no further.  He didn’t dare run after escaped, illegal child laborers in the middle of New York City in the daytime.  I stared for a moment, then slowly shepherded the children away.

Hours later, the sun set, and night came on.  New York fell into a dreamless sleep.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1fp2l4,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1fp2l4/where_dreams_are_made/,

I'm gonna call this one ""In the quite""",Stella_Man,24,10,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1e9u6v/first_time_poster_constructive_criticism_welcome/,"It’s quiet now. So still and so quiet. I’m all alone here. No one can bother me now. I just sit here waiting. Waiting so patiently for him to arrive. It has been a long time since last I saw him, but I still remember everything about him. He rarely ever talks to me anymore, but I can still hear his voice echoing in my memories. Memories that I had hoped were long lost. It’s so cold here in the quiet darkness. Suddenly the silence ceases, and I hear him approaching. 

The stamping of his feet on this cold hard floor is unmistakable. Such a long powerful stride. My body tenses as I can feel his presence thickening the air that I breathe. He stops and the deafening silence returns seemingly drowning out my own thoughts. The fear builds with the anticipation. Every time he comes to me I wonder to myself, “Why me? What have I done to deserve this?” The only one that ever answers is him. Suddenly I can hear his voice seemingly inside my own head. In a subtle whisper he speaks to me the same words he always says, “No one can help you, no one can hear you, no one cares, you are mine.” Each syllable causes me to cringe. My heart races and my skin flushes. The stench has finally arrived. It turns my stomach, and I gag. The smell of dead and dying things fills my nostrils as I struggle to breath. The stench is so palpable that I can taste it. Eventually I succumb to my body’s urges to vomit. I try to raise my hands to my mouth to keep from spewing everywhere, but the chains restrict me. 

I almost forget that they are there sometimes, but not now. Now I can feel the heavy iron, cold against my wrists. In the darkness; the quiet seems to be the strongest sensation that I experience. Suddenly I feel his hand on my shoulder. Almost giant in stature, his hand engulfs my shoulder and the searing pain begins. I try to muffle my screams for as long as I can. I think he enjoys hearing my scream. The burning sensation quickly rushes over my entire body. I feel like if I had clothes on that they would  turn to ash by contacting my skin. I wish that I would just turn to ash and this would be all over. 

With his one hand he lifts me to my feet. He walks around to look me in the face. I never understand how even in the darkness I can see the emptiness of his face. His cold dark eyes seem to stare right into my soul. I have no secrets from him. I can hide no fear or sadness. The subtle smile on his face makes it all the worse. He enjoys this. He enjoys it as much as I dread it. His hand, still on my shoulder, makes a sudden swipe  across my chest ripping flesh from bone. My legs crumble beneath me but the chains hold me in place. The chains once keeping me down are now holding me up and exposed for another lashing. The tears flowing down my face burn as they reach my open wound as if made from fire. His smile grows as he grabs my arm and begins to peel the flesh and muscle toward the shackle at my wrist. All I want is to give up, to die, to end the pain, but he would never allow that. He knows he must keep me alive to maintain his pleasure. 

My screams can no longer escape. Only the screams I hear in my head remain. Only the silence can reveal the sound of my blood dripping on the cold floor. It feels warm on my feet if only for a moment. He begins to laugh. The thundering booms of his voice echo in my ears only outdone by the excruciating pain. His laugh fades as he begins to walk away. Each long stride more emphatic than the last until I am once again left alone in the cold, dark quiet of my own solitude only to wait in uncertainty for his next visit.

Back and forth between his kitchen and his living room. His house was a small one, so the distance between the two rooms was fairly short. It was a little two bedroom, one bathroom out in the country in western Tennessee. He had bought it with his wife Beth almost exactly 13 years ago to the day. Garret loved Beth, he really did. Their marriage wasn't perfect, but what marriage is? Together they had two beautiful children. First came Autumn, an exact replica of her mother at 17, and then 5 years later they were blessed with a boy, Randy, who was now 12. It was a Monday, and this was important because Garret was always especially angry on Mondays. He didn't have to work, or handle business or really do anything on this particular Monday, but he was angry nonetheless. It was his anger that caused him to lash out at Beth about 40 minutes earlier and he hated himself for it. He paced back and forth wondering what he was going to do. All she did was ask him when he was going to cut the grass. He'd been putting it off for quite some time and it was in desperate need of a cut.
“Just cut the grass” He spoke outloud to himself. Beth wasn't there, that was his fault. “Why couldn't I just shutup and cut the damn grass.”
He stared down at the kitchen floor and closed his eyes really tight. Hoping that she would come back so he could apologize. She would come back, she always did. Often times Beth would go for a drive over to her mothers house, or to the local diner for a cup of coffee, anything to clear her mind. Garret forced a swallow down his tight throat. Something told him she wasn't going to come back this time. He had been too mean earlier, way too mean. He'd really done it this time. What would he tell the kids? How is a man supposed to tell his kids why their mother wasn't there to greet them home from school and fix them a snack, like she had every day. Why she wasn't at supper, or wasn't there to tell them goodnight. She wasn't at the diner this time, something in her eyes before she left him just cast a shadow over Garrett's heart.
Garret continued pacing and talking to himself, stopping only a few times to wash his hands, go to the bathroom, and wash his hands again. Before he even noticed the clock tick, 4 hours had gone by and it was just about 3 in the afternoon. Autumn would be coming home soon. Garrett placed both of his hands on top of his head and let out an audible sigh.
“What in the fuc--” Just before he finished his sentence the phone rang. It wasn't his, it was Beths cellphone. Garrett picked it up and quickly answered it.
“Hello?”
“Daddy? Why do you have mom's phone?” It was Autumn, she probably just left the school.
“She's in the shower. What did you want?” He asked in a slightly nasty tone.
“Wow, you don't have to be a dick Dad I was just calling to let you or mom know that i'll be getting Randy from school today, we're going to get ice cream before we come home, I promised him.”
“Oh, okay honey that's fine, see you in like an hour then?”
“Yep! Bye daddy love you.” She seemed happy.
“Love you too Autumn.” Click.
He placed Beth's cellphone back on the counter where it was and went to the sink to wash his hands one more time. The stickiness was bothering him.
“One hour.” He said to himself .
Garrett stepped over Beth's corpse and walked out into the sunlight of his backyard. He stretched out his back and arms, grabbed his shovel and dug 3 holes, humming to himself as a tear fell down his face.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1e0u5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1e0u5w/my_first_pasta_please_readcriticize/,

At first he was innocent, I thought he was just shy, he'd come and go.

As I grew up, he'd often get me in trouble. People wouldn't ever catch him, he always got away before they could, leaving me at the scene.
I remember my mother scolding me when she saw a dead cat a few feet away from me. 

I'd never harm a cat! I felt terrible even though I was innocent. She made me apologize to the owner, who's daughter had been in tears. I was miserable for quite a bit of time afterwards. 

Occasionally he'll come along and break something, and flee after, leaving me to take the blame. To be honest, I've never exactly got a good look at him, but I know when he's around, I feel his presence. I get sick, dizzy, confused, and paranoid. 

In high school, I'd look through our yearbook, in hopes of finding him. Ratting him out. But I never got lucky. 

My senior year, I remember getting my class picture taken, I saw him. His sickening smile, dressing like he was also graduating, I brought the picture to the Guidance and asked them who he was, they laughed at me and asked if I was joking. I brought it to my parents, they did the same. Can they not see him? Am I the only one who can see him?  

I remember my parents getting me a therapist. Apparently I'm worrying them. With my behavior. I'm tired of this. That kid constantly ruining my life. People at my school avoid me. As if I'm some sick, twisted lunatic. 

I remember him coming in, and strangling the therapist, I tried to stop him, but I couldn't. His grip was to firm around the therapists neck, I managed to stop him, but after security was rushed in, the therapist yelled at me! I saved him and now he is scolding me! Security held me back. 

I'm twenty three years old now, and I have to spend the rest of my life in a mental hospital after I shot a cop. Doctors tell me that I have a split personality, that it's basically someone else inside of me. My heart sunk when I was told this. 

All those years it was me, I was responsible for everything this entire time. My family occasionally visits me, they tell me they miss me and that they love me. I know they're lying, I know they're afraid of me. I apologize to them for the horrible life I've given them. I can see it in their eyes. I'll occasionally catch a glance of my mother wiping a tear off before it rolls down her cheek. 

I managed to stop myself, from committing suicide. I stopped him- me, from it. I told the doctors about it, and I am heavily medicated on specific days, I hate it, but it prevents my other personality from coming in. I'm surrounded by supportive people now, so I think I'll be able to manage. I still can't forgive myself for the people I've hurt, but, they accepted my apology. I think it's time I go now, the doctors waiting. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1dh7z1,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1dh7z1/splitpersonality/,

The buzzing sound is high pitched, and frequently pulsing. You can feel it in every part of your head. Your heartbeat leaps with every pulse, spurring your body's responses. You begin to manually breathe in and out, to try and control your pulse. But you know that buzzing sound won't let that happen. It's penetrative noise worms it's way through your defenses, and sinks deeper into your conscious being.

It's only a matter of time, now.

You try to focus on something, anything, to ignore that buzzing sound. Your family, your friends, your loved ones, your pets, your work, or your hobby. You close your eyes, and try to drift into your thoughts and your experiences. You float in your head, dreaming of instances that have come and gone, and can only be relived inside of you. You know you're safe in there, and the buzzing begins to recede.

I told you it was too late to do anything than continue, didn't I?

A pulse bursts through your skull and your memory changes. What once was a happy time in the park with your parents, is you all alone, abandoned by the unloving people that gave birth to you. What once was a happy time commemorating your 10th birthday, is now you all alone, your parents abandoning you, and all others your age shunning you. A happy relationship with your significant other? A horrible death at your hands, splattered with blood and gore, and a deeply sad, pitiable look in their fading eyes as they look to you for a reason why. Your pets? Your next meal, as you devour their still living flesh, flailing and weakly attempting to flee. Your work? A collection of failure and broken dreams, a reminder to all around you of what you could have been, had you not suffered such a callous fate.

Your hobby? Well, that's the only thing you really have left. But it's not the one you originally had that brought you pleasure.

You open your eyes, and look for a window. At any given time, you can usually find one person on the street somewhere. In houses, in cars, in walkways, and in their own heads. So many delightfully ignorant people. So many willing puppets. So many inconspicuous brothers and sisters to thank, by freeing them from this hell of flesh and life. To see them offer themselves up to the grand purpose of our species. To propagate through the mutual destruction of others. The other beasts around us that call themselves ""human"".

They can hear the buzzing, too. Just like you could, before you were made to listen to the buzzing in the back of the heads of every human being on this Earth. Soon, they too shall hear that buzzing sound in the back of their heads, and realize how they are truly meant to be. And when enough of our brothers and sisters finally wake up?

Actually, the question is, do you want to know why they are outside?

Bathrooms are a place filled with emotions. However, rarely happy ones. Locks on bathroom doors provide privacy, a need people get when they need to be alone. To cry. To vent anger. Every bit of emotion we do not wish the outside world to see. And as you sit on the toilet, your only company is yourself in the mirror. The mirror that sees all the pain, all the grief all the suffering. And your reflection sees this. Your reflection absorbs this, it embraces everything. All the vengeful emotions revolving around the bathroom reflection. In the reflection, they can do all they desire. Knock off a shampoo bottle, turn on the faucets. It could do this, but it does not want to. That would be foolish, it would just scare you off. It needs you in the darkest of darkness. For what you cannot see, that you cannot escape. It needs the reflection of a light switch. And if it does get you, every emotion you have ever had in the bathroom will come through you with the force of the times it has been seen. Turning you into the person you do not wish the outside world to see. Angry, depressed. A wreck with no purpose. 

As long as the reflection cannot see a way to turn off the light, as long as there exists light, you are safe. So lets not hope you have a jester in your household. A jester with naive desires for fun. A jester unaware of the emotions festering in the bathroom. A jester, who turns off the light while you're inside.

The following is taken from the culprit's diary, and is to be treated as evidence. There were no dates marked in the diary, and only bits of the information have been confirmed.

(there is blood covering one or two sentences in the beginning of the page) and we're going back to see the old house again. I'm propably going to take some pictures too. It's going to be fun seeing what shape the house is in. I just hope it hasn't been sold or demolished or anything, since it's not technically our property anymore. I know Rick would be glad to see it torn down, even though I told him to watch over it. He just can't forgive my dad, even after his death. Oh well. Maybe I'll go see Rick too.

We arrived at the house and it was in pretty ok condition (considering it was already rotten when we left. I was sure it would have collapsed, at least a part of it). The swing at the backyard was apparently stolen or something, because only the metal frame remained. My son went inside before me and Grace, and he took my camera with him, so I don't have any pictures of the outside. When I went inside I noticed a smell coming from one of the rooms. When I looked inside I saw some dead crows lying on the floor. It was horrible, as some of them were half eaten. Poor things propably got trapped inside somehow and got attacked by a wild cat. I closed the door, and hoped my son hadn't seen what was in there.

I went upstairs, and saw someone walking into my son's old room (it was at the end of a corridor, so I just barely caught a glimpse of them), and I could almost swear it was...well, It's impossible so I won't even bother writing it. Anyway, I quickly followed to see if I was right, and in the room stood my son, and no one else. I was relieved. I almost thought that bastard had returned, but it had just been my eyes playing tricks on me. I bursted out laughing, when I saw my son's terrified face (I had propably scared him quite a bit when I ran in the room) and at that moment Grace walked in. I hadn't noticed it, but there was a mirror in the room, just behind my son. Not just any mirror. It was my dad's. That fucking mirror. I got rid of it once already, but someone found it and put it back up. I was so angry at this point that I just walked out the room. How was it there? Who had put it back up? I was almost sure my dad had returned. Returned to make my life a living hell again.

God, I got angry again just writing that. Anyway, I walked out of there and headed to another room. It was the old bedroom. It was completely empty, save one cardboard box in the corner. I opened the box and the anger turned into overwhelming joy. There were all of my family's portraits. My sister, my mother and me. I looked like the angry kid I was back then. I told my family to come over and have a look at the pictures. (blood is covering some words, and the sentence makes no sense)

When everyone was back in the car, I remembered the mirror again. I hadn't taken a closer look at that mirror, but I'm sure it was my dad's. I looked at grace, and she knew what I was thinking. She knew about the mirror as well. I don't want to explain the story, but maybe I should anyway.

The reason I hate that mirror is my dad. The mirror in itself isn't evil, but in his hands anything can be a tool of pure agony. He used to cover it with a white cloth when it wasn't being used, and I think he knew what he accomplished by doing this. Every time he removed the cloth, all of us, my mother, sister and me knew that we had to hide. He would grab onto his bottle, and start humming this tune that haunts me to this day. He would come after us, and whoever got caught, was to be tortured in front of that mirror. He would just beat me up, but he did things far worse to my mother and sister. Me and my sister hated him so much, but mother wouldn't leave him. We didn't really have any place to go anyway, he was the one bringing the money home. 

One day, my sister just snapped. She took a knife and walked in front of the mirror. She broke it, and sliced her throat. I saw it happen, and had no idea how to react. I was just numb. I must have passed out after that, because the next thing I saw was mom and dad fighting. By fighting, I mean my dad had pinned her down and was hitting her. I was so scared, I ran away and grabbed the phone. There was just one number next to the phone, titled Rick. He was a friend of my dad and dropped by to visit every now and then. In panick I called him and told him what had happened. I then hung up without even waiting for a response. I ran to the mirror room, and saw my mom lying on the floor with a shard of the mirror piercing her throat, and my dad undressing, standing over the corpse of my sister. I was filled with rage. I saw what had happened to my sister when she was caught and put in front of the mirror, and now, after she had escaped to death, it was about to happen once more. I grabbed a shard of the mirror and stabbed my dad with it. He screamed, and turned around to face me. I was 10 at that time, and not strong enough to cause any serious injury, so my dad just smiled and started coming after me. I wasn't scared. For the first time of my life, I was so disgusted and angry, that I didn't care about what would happen to me. My father had to die.

I sliced his face three times, and it was enough to make him retreat. After holding his face for a while, he grabbed the knife my sister was holding, and started coming after me again. This is when Rick came through the front door and tackled my dad. He pinned my dad down, and started looking around to see if everyone was alright. You could see that all he wanted was to snap my dad's neck, but the police he had apparently called arrived, and took my dad away. He got a lifetime in jail, because of some asshole laywer who got him out of deathrow. I explained what had been going on to Rick, who almost threw up several times during it. He took me in and raised me as well as he could, and together we buried my mother and sister. We got rid of the mirror, buried it deep in the forest. The house was left with no owner, and I later moved there with my family. We moved away from there about a year ago, because I started having reocurring nightmares about my dad returning.

I had told Grace the story about the mirror and my family when we moved in to live there, but my son doesn't know. I hope to keep it that way.

On the way back home, I decided we should go to see Rick and ask him about the mirror. I didn't want my son to know about my past, so I tried to make it seem like I didn't know what the mirror was. I asked Rick if it was his and apologised for my son breaking it (this was just meant as a hint for Rick to play along) but he looked at me with a strange, almost scared expression. He told me he had thrown it away. I'm not sure, but I think he meant he had thrown it away again. I was scared. I couldn't say anything and just stood up and left. Grace followed.

We got home and I put the pictures on the kitchen table. I was still thinking about that mirror, and how it had gotten there, to that room. I can't let this go. I will go back there in a few days. I'm not going to say anything to grace or my son, but I will go there.

Get the fuck out (blood is spilled here, and may be covering part of the text)

The diary was found on the crime scene, on a table next to the picture of a young boy, supposedly the culprit when he was a child. In the house was found a broken mirror with gold framing, and two other bodies next to it. An inscription on the mirror says ''Watch the next generation repeat our deeds''. (Here is the picture of the diary when found, next to the little boy's portrait http://i.imgur.com/9TQqz2R.jpg ) The culprit had supposedly killed the two victims with a shard of the broken mirror, and gouged his eyes out afterwards. Signs of violation were visible on the body of the female victim. The investigation goes on as we try to find out what drove the man to commit this crime.

1352999305.0,14,self.creepypasta,138x0g,The Davenport Demon (Wrote this quite some time ago),ColtonH,30,16,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/138x0g/the_davenport_demon_wrote_this_quite_some_time_ago/,"It was the year 1964 in Davenport, Iowa. A decent-sized city, it lay on the Mississippi River. I've only heard about the events involving this “demon” from people in the area, and from a few miscellaneous newspaper clippings that made their way to Nebraska.

During the summer of 1964, a couple were diving along the Mississippi River on S Concord Street at night, around 23:00. As they were driving, the woman – a Miss Clarissa Belle – pointed out something weird in the river water. Almost immediately after, ""something horrendous reared from the water, and raced across the road,"" as put by Clarissa Belle when interviewed a few weeks after the second sighting, when it began to be taken seriously by the media. The couple barely had time to make out what it was, and the man – a Mr. Samson Browne – slammed on the brakes.

They stopped, and thought that they had hit whatever it was. Clarissa Belle, terrified yet, stayed in the car as Samson Browne got out to check it out. While the car had been splashed with river water, it was undamaged and they returned to town, only mentioning it as an oddity to their friends.

It was in late winter of 1969 that the second reported sighting of the “demon” was made. In this instance, the demon was seen by a married couple – Jolene and Hank Miles – and their friend, whose name has been forgotten to time. It was once again by the river, this time on River Drive on the way home from Credit Island Park.

The “demon” emerged from the river's icy surface in a sudden surprise lunge, landing on the roadway's southern lane right in front of the car. Jolene Miles had, when the couple reported it to the newspapers, described it as “ugly and vile, almost like a disfigured raccoon with the most godforsaken tentacles”. Surprisingly (unless a frequent reader of such newspaper reports, where witnesses that were together frequently contradict one another), Hank Miles had left out the comparison to a raccoon and described it as almost catfish like, except with tentacles instead of fins. This description was the same as their friend's, except in that simple comparison.

In the 70s, reports grew of it until a climatic encounter in the fall of 1975. Unlike most of the reports, this one was not on a car but rather at a private boat ramp in Davenport Harbor. Lee Anderson and his current mistress, Britney Cooper, were putting their boat into the harbor at night when the water began to have a strange light from it, as if there were “Search lights underneath the water's surface.”

They were intimately entangled when suddenly the boat tipped, sending them both into the water. Barely escaping, Lee Anderson reported that his mistress had fallen in and drowned to the police, and that a “thing with tentacles” had attacked the two of them. The burn marks on his body were explained by the idea of something electrical being dropped into the water with them. When the body of his mistress was found, it was burned completely to an almost unrecognizable point, except for the face.

This first deadly encounter led to Lee being charged with manslaughter despite his reporting it as an animal attack and the wounds being nearly impossible for the man to make (without specific equipment), and Lee Anderson was sentenced to prison He committed suicide a week after being let out on parole. Throughout the 70s, several more reports were made.

By the 80s when the last major newspaper report on the Davenport Demon was made (which was another event like the first death from the “demon”) it had become a local legend. To this day, it is unknown if the Davenport Demon was real, or if it was simply a scapegoat for accidents and murders that people tried to use. While there are some people who claim to have seen it still, none of these stories have been put into the newspapers and have merely been mentioned by people who live in Davenport, and even then mainly people who had been hunting it much like the more popular Bigfoot Hunters.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_138x0g,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/138x0g/the_davenport_demon_wrote_this_quite_some_time_ago/,

She asked the Sheriff of her town to look into it and when he arrived in her sisters town with one of his deputies none of the population could be found. they searched an apartment and the deputy came across an unknown monster in a dark room which caused the two lawmen to head home and call in government help. Later on they return to the town, searching with a CDC team and after searching the apartment again they come under attack by the monster again. once outside they realize that each house has similar monsters coming from them. the towns people had become deformed, with upside down faces, walking on all fours etc.

A fellow redditor whom I know IRL has been a tremendous help to me in being there to bounce ideas off of. My original idea was to have the antagonist be a demon of some sort, as this, IRL, would be horrifying. However, in terms of the game, a demon doesn't make for a good story because of the fact the players can conquer a demon, and view it from a game standpoint.

Listen, if I don't respond in the ne- dammit, the lights are flickering again. Anyway if I don't respond in the next few hours it means I didn't make it out of here. I'm sorry, I have to be brief. SHIT! That noise again and now the light-switch won't work....I have to go find a weapon of some kind, there may not be time. Stand by for a follow up.

Edit: OK, found an old baseball bat in my closet. Inside with a flashlight typing as you read this. I caught a few glimpses of it, but you can only make out a sort of reflection/gleam of teeth, and that damn shine that cats and dogs eyes give off. I don't know whats going on-other apartments seem to have lights on, but my power is dead. I can't find my wife either. My dogs havent woken up, witch is odd....Staying hidden for now, thought I heard a low grumble. Turning off the light and closing the laptop till I don't hear it. I don't want to be detected from light under the door...shit, louder now, it's close....stand by.

Update: Were back. Something brushed up against the closet door, made it rattle a little (shitty apartment.) Anyway-after that, there was a loud thump in the bathroom, like something hit the linoleum floor, then there was a scampering of claws on the bathroom floor. It's how my dogs sound when they are trying to gain traction..but they're both crated up for the night. I'm going to move out of the closet. Check on the dogs and look for my wife. I have goosebumps. I'll update again in a few minutes, maybe I should let the dogs look around?

Update 3: The dogs are OK. They're awake, but I opened the crate door and they refuse to come out..Fuck. something is running up the stairs.....fuck this I'm getting in the crate with my dogs and going lights out for a minute....I'll upd

Update 4: Sorry I cut you off, it was too close, whatever it is. I've abandoned the laptop in favor of my phone, as it gives off much less glow. I made it into the kitchen, and slipped in warm, wet fluid. The dogs water bowls are in here, I hope thats what it is..water. Too much of a pussy to look. I felt something hot on my neck. Like warm breath. I think it's toying with me. Still looking for my wife. I'm moving on to the office (second bedroom) for solitude. I can still hear scurrying, but I haven't seen the eyes again. I don't know if that's good or bad. I fear i may have lost her.

Update 5: Those fucking blue and red lights again...how I hate those lights. Someone knocked at the door. I won't answer it. They don't understand. It's the same thing that happened years ago, with my first wife. They didn't believe me then either. I tried to tell them, I didn't know why they found her like that, her body twisted up...eyes gleaming in the dark of the garage...
It's happening again, it's all that damn --- Thing. It does this to them. I swear it's not me, Redditors. It's not my fault.

Those fucking eyes. When she looked at me in the bathroom, I had to do it. I had to use the bat.
It had taken her. The good new is, I found my wife. I finally found her. Please tell them it wasn't my fault. I told her to stay out of the garage.

I was a child then, but when I thought about the ocean growing up, it always reminded me of home. In the past years, I'd decided to move back. It took some coaxing on my part to have the misses decide that it was a better place for us. I told her that we only have one kid, and he's still an infant, so why not now before he becomes old enough to go to preschool? So she reluctantly agreed. She had always wanted a place to call our own anyway. She was tired of the tiny apartment we lived in.
Anyway, we left the apartment behind and moved to the rural part of South Carolina, where the ocean was in view and we had a lot of land. When we saw the house for the first time, it looked a little run down, something of a fixer upper, with its pale green paint and  the shingles falling off of the roof. It seemed erie. It was a old shore house that we got a deal on and even though it needed to be fixed up, we were happy. Our first night there, we slept on the living room floor.
In the middle of the night, I awoke sweating. I was breathing hard and it felt like I had just been shoved to awake. I looked around to see nothing. That's when I heard a stir in our patio. I jumped up from the air mattress and walked cautiously towards it. Through the tiny window I could see a light shining through. Now this wasn't just any light. It was different. It was bright as day and seemed unreal. I heard laughing as I walked towards the door. I opened it and the last thing I remember was being bathed in the light and a feeling of piece.
When I awoke the next morning I was laying next to my wife. I had assumed the whole thing was a dream and I told my wife what happened. She said it must have been the fact that we moved into a new place and the happiness I felt of being here. She just smiled at me and told me not to think anything of it.
That day the movers arrived and we started putting things in their rightful places. It started to feel like home. 
A week had passed and nothing. No dreams of laughter or anything. No light, no feeling of being shoved. So I started to forget about the dream. 
We were happy. This place had a feeling of happiness and a sense of peace.
The next month went by in a flash. We started to paint and fix up our kitchen. I remember my wife going into town for some things when that light had appeared again. This time I knew I was awake. I heard that same laughter on the patio. As I walked towards it, I felt a sense of peace and the laughter got louder. When I opened the door this time, I didn't pass out but instead felt the light drawing me towards the water. It was the strongest thing I have ever felt. It kept pulling me, closer and closer to the shores edge. 
Over the waves and the laughter, I heard my wife's voice. The laughter ceased and I felt the pull no more. I was shaking. Scared. Confused. I turned to see my wife standing on the patio looking at me with a face full of worry. ""Honey? What's the matter? You look so pale. Are you okay?"" I just looked at her and said, ""That dream was real, Beth. Whatever this thing is, it wants me to come with it towards the water."" 
She looked puzzled. ""So you're saying a ghost or something is pulling you near the water?"" I nodded. That's when she laughed and told me that stories would get me no where. She then walked back inside to attend to our son. I remember standing there for like seemed like hours when my wife called me in to sleep. 
That night, sleep had decided to leave me and I was left wide awake. I got up out of our bed and grabbed my laptop. By this time we had all of our amenities and wifi was essential to my work. I opened up Facebook and started chatting up a friend about what happened. He was skeptical but answered all my questions I had. He said it could be a number of things. A poltergeist, just a ghost, even as drawn out as a mermaid. I didn't really believe that it was a mermaid or anything he said but at this point, I wasn't sure what to believe. 
Around three in the morning after talking to my friend, I crawled into bed and held my wife. I was scared but I wasn't going to tell her that. She was even more skeptical then my friend about all this. I fell asleep that night with all the possibilities of ghosts an mermaids swirling in my head.
I woke up the next morning to the smell of pancakes and coffee. It had seemed that my wife had gotten up early to make us breakfast. 
I dressed and walked to the kitchen to see my wife and two year old eating. ""Morning."" I said with a smile, ""Seems you were busy preparing breakfast."" 
""Yeah,"" Beth said, ""I thought it would be nice. How'd you sleep?""
That's when I heard something different in her voice. ""I slept fine babe."" I pulled out a chair and sat down. ""What's on the agenda for you guys today?"" I said through a mouthful of pancakes.
""I was thinking we'd go for a swim. Would you like to join us?"" She said with erie sincerity.
""I think I'll pass. I gotta catch up on some work."" I was lying. ""I can watch Joshua if you want.""
""No. I wanted to take him swimming with me."" He coed as Beth said his name. ""Are you sure you don't want to go swimming with us Steven?"" This is when she gave me the oddest smile I had ever seen her give me.
""Yeah I'm sure. Are you doing alright? You've never given me that smile before Beth.""
""I'm fine."" she said as her eyes darted from me to the window quickly.
After I finished eating I went to our bedroom to message my friend again. My message was as follows:

Howie,
You know how I told you about that light and you gave me lists of what it could be? Well, Beth has started acting strangely. She gave me the oddest smile that I've never seen her give me before. Could it be a ghost or something?

Steve

I sat staring at that note, thinking how crazy it sounded and then I pushed send. In about thirty minutes I got a response.

Steve,
Is there anything she has insinuated towards the ocean or anything like that. She could be possessed or drawn to the same light like you are. If I were you, I would leave that house.

Howie

After I read that message, I heard laughter again. I walked towards the patio and I saw the most gruesome scene I have ever seen. On the patio i saw blood splattered across the finished wood. On the walls I saw written in blood, ""Come join me Steven. The water is nice."" The laughter grew louder and i heard my wife's voice, ""Steven, it's okay. Everything is okay. Follow me into the water and peace will find you."" I looked up to see my wife with outstretched arms on the shore. She was beckoning me, trying to coax me into following her towards the water. The laughter was deafening now. As tears filled my eyes for the death of my son, I saw the light. That peaceful light, surrounding my Beth. The tears stopped and I felt pulled again.

    It was autumn and the leafs began to fall. I was going to work with my father, as I do each fall. I  go to Allen city Kansas, My parents have a farm there. It's just out in the country, Mostly peaceful. My parents own a house out in the forest that I stay in each year. I started to notice holes dug all around. I thought nothing of it.
    It was about 10:00 at night, and I was driving down the usual road to get back home. It was a tough day fixing my dad's storage building. I was drowsy, and didn't really want to be driving. I looked down a second, To get a drink  of water. When my eyes saw the road, I was wide awake. It happened in a flash of light. My car, About to this big animal standing in the road. Bracing myself for the worst,  I opened my eyes, and it was gone. No blood, no bumps, nothing. 
    I had come to the conclusion that it was just my Eyes playing tricks on me, But it didn't seem that way. Deep inside me I knew what I saw was real. I got home and went straight to bed. I woke Up at 3:40, at least I think it was. I stood up, feeling lightheaded, and and extreme nausea. I drank some water and went to bed. On my way there, I looked out my bedroom window, and IT was standing there! 
     This creature standing before me was about four Five, six feet tall, With arms that reached its deformed feet. It's hands Were just big claws, covered with mud. But it's face was the worst of it.
It had small black eyes that were completely void of life. It's mouth was 
Curved with long rectangular teeth, it almost appeared to be smiling. It was completely gray, with a few black spots on its arms. I stared at
It through my window in shock, while the creature moved off. It rammed
Into my wall, and stopped. I waited on my bed for a sound. I was terrified, Yet eager to see what it did next. After 10 minutes of silence, the thing started To dig. It kept digging, on the side of my house, then to the middle of the yard. It kept digging and digging, until it hit a rock or just stopped. I put the Sheets over my head and cried like a child. After a while, the digging became somewhat
Soothing, and rhythm, I started to like it. It finally put me to sleep...
I woke up the next morning, walked outside.  I found a soft patch of dirt,
Got on my knees, and started to dig.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_xju39,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/xju39/dig/,

1329527523.0,14,self.creepypasta,puo8m,Woodlot in Southern Michigan,SkullyKitt,19,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/puo8m/woodlot_in_southern_michigan/,"When I was 14, some friends and I went for a hike in the woods near my house. We were headed for a spot we had cleared out and set up into a kind of hangout. We had a fire pit, some logs, a beat up old lawn-swing set that we used like a couch, etc. We went out a handful of times to do some Midnight Society style story telling, but it turns out that hiking in the woods at night when there’s random garbage all over the place and random noises and it rains a lot - well, it’s not that fun, so we gave up on it.  


I want to stress that I say ‘random garbage,‘ I don’t mean cans and wrappers and stuff like that. By no stretch of the imagination were these what you might call ‘pristine’ woods - people dumped furniture, car parts, all sorts of nonsense out there and left it to rot or rust. I mean, just bizarre stuff, regarding how much work it would be to just haul that shit out there - who decides to abandon a fridge in the woods? What do you do, take a hand-truck or something and wheel that shit out into the trees? Or an engine block, or a book shelf - we once found what looked like most of a dollhouse, left to be eaten up by nature. Just really random crap. 

That particular day, we were headed there to kind of have a last to-do with one of our number who was moving away later that week. We’ll call him John. His dad had gotten a job in another state, and while he promised to visit, we were all kind of treating this like this might be the last time we saw him. We had backpacks full of pop, my d-cell battery-powered stereo, lots of snacks, etc. The weather was really great, and overall it was a pretty good time. 

After several hours, we decided to hike back. It was about an hour’s worth of walking, and if we waited too long to get started out it’d be dark, and none of us had thought to bring flashlights. 

About halfway out of the woods, one of us realized he’d left his cell phone behind, and we had to go back. However, on the way, John noticed something off the path and pointed it out. It was a chair. 

We all got closer to check it out: none of us had noticed it when we were leaving the clearing for the first time, but every one of us recognized it immediately. It was one of the chairs from John’s dining room. A lot of furniture had already been packed up and/or shipped, but the dining room set had been out on the lawn this morning waiting to get loaded up. The one who thought he lost his phone found it in his jacket, so we turned back to leave, taking the chair with us.

For such a small thing, it was surprisingly bulky and annoying to move, especially since we were all already carrying our own crap. There was talk of leaving it behind, but John’s mom had apparently inherited the set from his grandmother, and would be really upset to find out a chair had been taken, so we took turns carrying/dragging it as we walked. We came to the conclusion that some dick had stolen it for laughs, then left it. 

After we left the woods, it was only about 15 minutes to John’s house. There was an ambulance waiting when we got there. Apparently, in the process of shifting an armoire, it had fallen and injured his mom. It broke her foot, but she recovered alright. We managed to get the chair in the moving van while he found out what was going on, so they never even knew it was missing. After he moved, I didn’t hear a lot from him - we just kind of drifted apart. I guess it was a friendship of convenience, given how close together we all lived.  

I’m sure you’re wondering where the creep-factor in all this is supposed to be: well, here’s where it gets weird. A few years later, someone abandoned a wooden footlocker by our ‘hangout.’ We put it to use as an extra seat, and a table for card games. At some point, someone else - when we weren’t there - smashed it up. We decided to use the broken chunks as firewood, but took note for the first time that the letters SGT - which we took to mean ’sergeant’ had been stenciled on the side that must have been towards the ground, as well as what seemed like a surname - meaning this had been some Veteran‘s trunk. Out of curiosity, we googled the name in our local area, and with a little sleuthing, figured out who they were and where they lived. Or, HAD lived, since it turned out that the guy we tracked down had died. Recently, in fact - right around the time the trunk had shown up in our clearing. 

I know it’s a long shot, and a weird conclusion to draw, but having grown up around those woods, and after years and years of finding so much random crap out there, I couldn’t help but wonder about connections. 

This past year, someone broke into our house. The door was forced, but my parents didn’t notice anything missing. I did - but I didn’t mention it to them. Someone had gone into my room, and stolen the stereo from all those years ago. Nothing came of it, of course - 

After all, I knew right where to find it. I brought it home, and that was the last of it. 

I don’t hike in the woods anymore.

The sound echoes through the room as I examine the body, clean kill, a smooth almost surgical incision to the throat. Blood now covering the floor makes it difficu lt to get out of the room without leaving footprints; then again I always love a challenge. She was fun, they all are. Never once have I left unsatisfied after one of my callings.

One town, one victim, this is how it must be. I have to be invisible to avoid detection. That is the only way I can spread my message to the world. They have to know why I do this, without them knowing exactly who I am. This is the second kill today the other was much less methodical, his death didn’t matter. I simply needed his identity for a cover, the power company goon that reads your meter.


Well, it's almost three thirty; her children are going to be barreling through the door in about ten minutes, time to get out of here. I take off the painter suit revealing the uniform I procured this morning and stuff it and the knife, now glistening red in the light, into the tool bag and walk out of the back door of the garage and read the meter before I hop into the work truck and drive around aimlessly for about twenty minutes before slowly driving by the house to catch a peek at my work.


I drive by the house slowly as not to arise suspicion, after all there are two police cruisers in front. Who wouldn’t want to see what happened? In a town this small everybody knows everything just minutes after it happens. I happen to see two children, Kaileigh and Trevor Paulsen knees and hands covered in their mother's blood and tears in their eyes being escorted out of the house by two of Boothbay’s finest. The look on everyone’s face is tantalizing, such grief, it’s simply amazing. The two officers’ faces are the greatest part, I mean kids love their parents, but only in a small town would this affect, seemingly complete strangers so powerfully. They probably went to high school with Karen; maybe one of them even had sex with her after prom, who knows? All I know is it's time to leave town and pick my next martyr, somewhere far, somewhere smaller.

A little baggie with two blue capsules. And a stupid note with two blue capsules. And a stupid note with two words… “Do try”

I figured it was some shitty prank from my “experimental” friends from down the street. We’ve tried nearly every reasonable drug there is, trying to get the most psychadelic trips, maintain the best highs..

DMT, E, Acid, some experimental shit this dude sold me for wayy too much. Shit fucked me up… I tripped I was dust floating down from the ceiling. Lasted like eight hours. Fucked… me… Found the shit on my porch one night… Fucking ding-dong ditch or whatever. A little baggie up…

Anyway, the pills had like an orange 17 on them… Looked them up online, and couldn’t find anything.

I threw it on my dresser and crashed for the night.

I called all my friends the next afternoon. They all “claimed” they had nothing to do with it. “Wasn’t them”. I figured one of them would fess up eventually…

Over the next week, I pretty much forgot about it. None of my friends said anything, so either they forgot, or it really wasn’t them. I didn’t feel like mentioning it, we had some concentrated Salvia, so we lit that up.

The next day, curiousity killed me, I picked up the bag. Glanced at the note again… “Do it”… I swore it said “Do try” but I was high when I picked it up, so I dont know. But it entrigued me even more. I examined the pill. I reasoned with myself. I just couldn’t take it, it could be anything, but I was so curious. What if it was THE best high, the MOST psychadelic trip. I talked myself out of it. I set it down again, and I couldn’t help but feel like I was missing out…

The next few days were hell… I had a fever, and I felt like literal shit. Probably strep. I slept most of the day, but I awoke from the sound of my own heartbeat. My thoughts went instantly to the pill… I picked it up. It was practically calling my name. What the fuck did I have to lose. If I die, I die. I felt like dying anyway. For all I know, it could be some fucking antibiotics. I hoped for the latter. I looked at it one last time.

I downed it.

I remember “waking up”. The world was in negative. I was strapped to a chair, and these dark pulsating lights were eating away at my vision. I had no Idea what was going on, but I wasn’t scared. I was used to fucked up trips, but this was different. I felt empty. Time was moving backwards. Light was inverted. These dark lamps pulsing energy through my brain. A bass tone vibrating my body. I couldn’t close my eyes… I needed these “lights”. They were blackening the world. My world. The world where I resided and wasted time in the light. I finally understood. I was in the dark.

I started seeing the figures after what seemed like an eternity. Black masses of energy crawling towards me from every angle. I was seeing them in strobe. As the dark flashed, they crept closer and closer. I recognized them as friend. They were to free me from the light. Take me away from this white hell we all know so well. I wanted to go to them, but I made no attempt. I focused on the strobe. I needed them to move faster. To rid me of luminescence. Once and for all.

The strobe frequency slowed. Time started to speed up. The figures were stationary. The light was coming.

My cornea’s burned as the trip wore off. My emptyness enveloped me. The stobe was near out.. The figures no longer visible. I finally closed my eyes. Such a pale dark compared to true darkness.

When I opened them, I was in my bed. I shut them back immediately. I hated light. I hated our world. I wanted nothing more than to return to the chair. I couldn’t live here anymore. I couldn’t open my eyes. I reasoned with myself for hours to get up, to open my eyes. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t eat. I didn’t. I prayed for darkness. It meant nothing. I was in the white. The only way I knew to return to the black was the pill. I had one left, but I had to open my eyes.

My luminous mind was telling me it was just a trip. Don’t go back. Forget the abyss and return to normal life. The darkness was in favor. I didn’t want to go back, I needed it. It was the realization the world needed. But I didn’t care about the world. Only the dark.

Night came. I finally opened my eyes. Not to let the light in, but to get the pill. The last pill. As far as I knew, it was the last pill on earth. My want for darkness convinced me I only needed one. The figures would take me this time. I would forsake the light for the wondrous dark. I cared not what was in the dark. As long as it was unlit.

My body was weak. My eyes so adjusted to our world’s pathetic darkness, I felt as though I was looking at the sun. I needed the eclipse. I grabbed the bag. And without hesitation, swallowed the capsule. I would be home soon. I closed my eyes.

I “awoke”

I was back. Again in the chair. The dark was so comforting. Time moving the way I remembered. My frail body energized by the tones. The strobe showing me truths. The darkness was truth. I waited for the figures. I was confident they would take me this time.

Finally they limped into view. I praised them. Every strobe showed promise that I would soon forget light. Their movements were choppy and slow. But promising.

I urged them closer. Watching intently between strobes for their presence. They were getting close. I could feel them. Their pulses heavy on my chest. Our hearts beating in unison with the strobes. They were here.

The saviours were had arrived. They circled me. Crippled creatures that would transform my world. They opened my eyes to the dark, and closed them to the light. They held out their hands as the strobe slowed to a near stop. Everything was speeding up. I thought they took me. I closed my eyes.

When I opened them, I was in complete darkness. Beautiful, astonishing darkness. Every direction, an endless abyss void of light. This was what I had prayed for. Where I belonged. I never had to see light again. To open my eyes to anything but black was impossible. I loved it.

I got up to walk around my uncontaminated world. The dark Eden.

I stumbled over something. Something in the void? I felt around. This overewhelming darkness contained something familiar.

My old world.

Sometimes, fear of the unknown just seems like the preferable option than facing a real, concrete danger. Normally it’s nothing, though. One time, the beeper function of my wireless housephone went off, when I was the only one home. It could only be called from the living room. Another time, I swear someone took some change from my desk. They’re all probably just slightly disconcerting tricks of the memory.

But what would you do when something truly suggestive happens? Would you run, or just ignore it, like I did?

Last Monday was a normal day. I got up, brushed my teeth, changed into school clothes… All little parts of my morning ritual. It seemed like it would be another totally un-noteworthy day, until I saw the strings.

There were three or four thick twine strings in my room. They criss-crossed between the walls around my bed, one attached to the door. No way would I have missed them before; I should have tripped over them. They were tied to pins in the walls, which had also not existed before ten seconds ago.

Nobody could have been in my room while I was in it, let alone set this up. It was early, and my brain wasn’t processing correctly. I simply discredited the sight, untied the strings and left for school, leaving them balled up on my desk.

It didn’t get any better later. Outside my house there were hundreds of them, tied between houses, around cars, across streets… This had to be some super elaborate prank. One of those hidden camera shows, or a comedy improv blog. They had gotten everyone else to play along too; passers-by were tangled in them, tying them to objects they were walking towards and away from, as if they had been and were continuing to follow the course laid out for them.

I nervously continued my journey to school. On the bus, every except me was tied to the door. At school, groups of friends were tied to each other; teachers were tied to their desks and boards. Oddly enough, at this point all I could wonder was why I had been left out.

When my friend Lucy sat beside me in first period, she simply plonked her bag down on my lap and rested her chin in her hand, looking right past me to the window outside.

“Hey Lucy.”

No response.

“Come on, I didn’t expect you to be in on this too. “

She sighed and started taking books from her bag. All the books were tied to her hands. I grinned, and yanked one of the strings off a book. She didn’t seem to notice, instead simply disregarding the book completely, letting it drop to the floor without a moment’s hesitation.

“Um.” I leaned down, picking up her book and placing it back on her desk. She took no notice.

“Well, if that’s how we’re gonna play it.” I smiled, trying to look playful, but really just trying to hide my nervousness. I bundled all the strings attached to her together with one hand, then pulled them all free. She blinked, turning to stare at me.

“Holy crap, Martin. You’re like a ninja or something.”

“I’ve been sitting here for maybe ten minutes.” I smiled again, relieved my friend had finally “noticed” me.

“Where did all these strings come from??” She gasped, seemingly noticing for the first time. “I assumed you were all fucking with me…”

She stood up, backing into a corner. No one else in the class noticed.

“They weren’t here just a minute ago! Do you see them too??” Her tone made it clear she was genuinely scared.

“No. Didn’t you-. “ I was interrupted by my teacher slamming the door behind her. Everyone except me and Lucy murmured a good morning, and still, no one seemed to pay either of us any notice. “People have been ignoring me all day.” I said to Lucy, before turning to our teacher. “Hey! Dumb bitch! You can’t teach for shit!”

No reaction.

“I’m getting away from all this shit.” Lucy pulled a few strings aside and left the class. I followed, and surprise-surprise, no one else noticed.

We wandered the corridors, leaving and entering classes as we saw fit. Whenever we untied a chair or book from someone else, it was like it suddenly didn’t matter to them. It didn’t exist.



I showed her the street outside; there were more strings than when I came in this morning. Twice as many. We carefully picked our way through the tangle, making our way to a nearby coffee shop. Not particularly grand, I know. But what would you do in our situation? As I said, fear of the unknown sometimes seems like the safer option. On a few occasions, I suggested we untie a few more people. Lucy was opposed to it, remembering how terrified she’d been.

In the coffee shop, we grabbed a couple of sandwiches and drinks from the fridge. We found a table, untied all strings attached to the chairs, and sat down. We both ate in silence, both of us too scared, both of us distracting ourselves by watching the strangers in the shop, oblivious to the strings. After twenty minutes, Lucy spoke up. “Now she’s gonna take that sandwich.” She said, pointing at a woman across the shop. Sure enough, she walked to the fridge and took the plastic wrapped sandwich she was tied to. “She pays for it and leaves.” She did so, according to the prophecies of the strings. “That guy doesn’t intend to pay.” I watched as a man took his coffee and ran out of the store, the two servers just looking too exasperated to go after him.

“This is horrible.” She whimpered. “Let’s go. Please.”

Outside wasn’t much better. Everyone just followed the strings’ instructions, going about their daily lives. Lucy announced she was going home to sleep this off, and I agreed to walk her home. She only lived ten minutes away.

Away from the busier part of town there were fewer strings. It was nicer; we could pretend it wasn’t happening.

When we turned onto Lucy’s street, she stopped, her mouth falling open.

“What now?” I broke the silence, my voice sounding surprisingly small.

”Look.” She pointed outside one of her neighbours houses.

I saw it clearly, and I’ll take my memory of that moment ‘til the day I die. A little dark imp, maybe three feet tall, walking along with its knuckles on the ground, almost like a monkey. It had two bulbous yellow eyes taking up about half its face, and no mouth or any other facial features. It was holding a hammer and a ball of twine, which it was letting out behind it.

It walked quickly and quietly from the front door of the house to the mailbox. It stopped, hammered a nail into the side of the box, and tied it’s string around it. It turned to face us, and stopped when it spotted us.

My bottom fell out even further than it had already been, but it just stared with a look of surprise and curiosity. You could almost say it was the more frightened one. Suddenly, it beckoned to us with its tiny hand.

I looked at Lucy, she hadn’t moved. I looked back at the imp, which stared at me. I halved the distance between us, and then halved it again. This wasn’t fear of the unknown anymore; it was fear of this little guy. Didn’t seem like anything to be scared of. When I was a meter away from it, it extended its hand.

“Uh. Hi.” I shook it. It nodded in approval, blinking its massive yellow eyes up at me.

“So you’re the ones in charge of the strings?” It nodded eagerly. I called Lucy over, but she stayed where she was.

“There are more of you?” Another nod. I wanted to ask it so many questions, about what it was and where it came from, but it seemed for now I was stuck with only yes or no questions.

“Do we even have free will?”

It just looked at me, almost sadly. I immediately felt sick to my stomach, and couldn’t bear looking at the little monster anymore. I grabbed Lucy, who had been listening to our exchange, and now sat on the curb with her head in her hands.

“Come on.”

We entered her house, and I made her a cup of tea. When I found her in the living room, she had untied her dog and was curled up with it, crying. I set the tea down and sat beside her.

“I’m so scared.” She whispered after a good ten minutes of sobbing. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

“I’m going to sleep” She mumbled suddenly, and was under within the minute. Sleep was starting to sound pretty good all of a sudden, my eyelids suddenly felt like they were being weighed down.

I collapsed to the rug, and the last thing I heard before I fell asleep was the scurrying of several sets of little feet nearby.

I felt much better the next day, as if the whole affair had been a dream. I’d probably have believed that if I hadn’t been awoken by Lucy’s mother that morning, wondering what I was doing sleeping over without permission or something.

Over breakfast, Lucy asked me why I looked so pale and nervous. I turned to her and smiled, mumbling something to her about feeling sick.

But the truth was, I was scared because I couldn’t see any strings, and was wondering whether my actions were truly my own. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,black,True,t3_nh76r,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/nh76r/string_theory/,

A mom, a dad, and a sister. If were not spending time with friends, we'd spend time with each other. Especially me and my sister. We got along great. We would do just about anything together. I love her with all of my heart 

My sister loved to laugh. She had such a bubbly personality. She would find just about anything funny. But one day, she was laughing much more than usual. We were watching a comedy show, and my sister was laughing uncontrollably. The joke on the show wasn't even that funny. But, I shrugged it off. We all have those moments. When we laugh when something isn't funny. Nothing too big

 The next day was a lot stranger than our average day. My sister still had a case of the giggles. That's not the weird part though. The weird part is that she was watching a horror movie. A brutal one at that. Laughing uncontrollably. This sent a shiver up my spine. But some horror movies do have comedy. I still asked her what was so funny. She just kept laughing as a character in the movie was being murdered. I had to leave the room.

 The following day...is one I will never forget. I was sleeping in after yesterday and I just heard my sister laughing per usual. I tried to going back to sleep but it was just to obnoxious for me ignore. So I go in the kitchen and see...something I couldn't bare myself to describe. What I saw still scars me to this day. My sister was just standing there with the kitchen knife. And behind her...were my parents. Soaked in blood. Dead. And she was laughing uncontrollably.  I slowly backed away and called 911. Thankfully, she didn't notice me. She probably would have killed me on the spot. The police came, and she was immediately sent to an insane asylum.

 After all of this happened, I had to live in a foster home and take years of therapy. I also, on occasion, visited my sister in the asylum. And every time I see her she just sits there...laughing uncontrollably.

We have taken walks like these many times and noticed a house, it was painted white on the outside and had no windows, there was a sign up front that had a fainted date on it, Me and Brandon had walked up to the sign, but Jack was always naive so he stayed back. The sign said ""Reichman's Resident"" I had noticed that the sign had a faded date that read ""12/4/????"",

I had a weird feeling in my gut knowing the date was not 12/4/????, I had asked Brandon if he had ever seen this house, naturally he had said no, Jack was a little worried and said ""Hey guys I'm heading home my parents would catch me dead if I'm out at midnight."" So he had left, Me and Brandon were a little curious so we walked to the front porch.

On the front porch we had noticed a small hole that had a resemblance of a face, we didn't worry about it much, we glanced in the house, the house was all lit up, the lights were on and in the house was completely empty... Knowing the lights were on Brandon, without any warning knocked on the door

We heard a faint ""coming...!..."" We stood waiting around two minutes so Brandon a complete fool knocked on the door again, we hear a bigger response ""please.... Wait...!"" Then just as we were walking away the door slammed open revealing no one to greet us, The slam had startled me and I asked Brandon "" Hey dude lets get of here I don't think we should stay any longer"" 

As soon as I had said that a noise came from the door screaming ""COME IN!"" Knowing Brandon the ignorant person he immediately stepped in, knowing I had to follow him I stepped in.. The door slammed shut, and the light dimmed, We were trapped and scared.

In the distance we heard a faint ""Welcome.... Here..."" Now we were terrified, knowing Jack was not to far off I had reached for my phone to text him... I opened my phone and had 75 messages all reading

""From: Jack
To:408******

Hey are you afraid of the dark? Lets have fun...
12/4/1849

Then my phone screen turned white leaving it nothing but a flashlight. Brandon was silently whispering to me ""This is so fucked...""

I whispered back to him ""stay quiet and follow me"" the reason I told him to follow me was I could tell he was scared out of his mind and could not lead. We had stumbled into the kitchen which had nothing but alcohol and lighter fluid, there were hooks hanging and swaying back and forth.

We had entered a black and crusty bedroom almost as if it had been burnt. We heard a faint noise that I could barely hear, this is what I think I heard.

""He's coming ??? The????""

The bedroom had drawers that Brandon had opened revealing nothing but old newspapers the print was faded but I could make out a few words

"" ???? Started ??? Casualtys""

We had eventually stumbled into a long hallway which had revealed one door, a perfectly framed door that looked new. In an instant a got a message on my phone

""From: Jack
To: 408*****

I was abandoned...
6/17/13

I was terrified but Brandon had said ""hey you should go through the door first naturally I would say no but I could not argue since he was scared shitless.

I head reached the door handle and on the other side was what looked like the front of the house I stepped out... And Brandon was gone he was behind me and he just disappeared into the darkness of the house, feeling so terrified I ran towards my house, everything seemed normal.

Nothing seemed to change, feeling relieved I went to the house next morning with Jack and Brandon, but something didn't feel right like i had forgot everything last night so I ignored it. The house was there and I had noticed two holes in the house with a human resemblance.

I got a text message that read

From: Jack,Brandon

""Come join us...""

    I have always been a paranoid person, ever since I was a child I would have terrible thoughts of monsters killing me in the night, or having illnesses that would end up killing me. No, matter what happened during the day I would get these terrible thoughts at night. At first the thoughts wouldn't be so bad, but as I got older it got worse I would lay in bed and see hallucinations of demons and killers standing over me...staring at me with their soulless eyes and their twisted smiles.

   
    Eventually I decided that I was sick of living in fear. So I went to go see a therapist, I told her about my thoughts and she said that I had paranoia and that I needed to learn how to control it. She gave me a prescription and reassured that it would help with the thoughts. 


   When I got home it was late, so I took the medication and headed to bed. Everything was peaceful at first until I heard a noise coming from my closet door. I looked at my closet and saw a dark character standing there, it had pale white skin and sunken black eyes, it's face was contorted into a horrible smile that showed its blood stained teeth. I stared at this character thinking to myself that it was merely a figure of my imagination, and that it would soon fade away. 


   The monster came closer to my bed. Leaning over top of me, staring right into my eyes. "" it's just an illusion"" I said trying to hide the fear in my voice. Suddenly the monster started to laugh. Before I could say another word the monster stabbed me. I cried out in agony, the metallic taste of blood in my mouth. As everything started to fade away the monster mocked me hissing ""it's only an illusion""

The cheap key chain he had just bought had a little light, 'twas the only thing that he was focusing on at the moment. As he pressed the small button on the side of the miniature coke can, the light illuminated the palm of his hand. Being the only thing getting his attention, the red spot started to make his eyes relax. His sight had no longer a clear focus.
It was kind of a calm despair that he felt. His head was working like crazy in the morning, stressing him up, and he just asked God for some time to sit down and think of nothing. And when he got it, guess what, things were going too slowly for him. He felt an urge to create, and with that came the agony of not having the inspiration.
He left himself seated for as long as a bored mind could remember, staring at the flashy light. The music wasn't even entering his ear anymore; he could only feel the low sounds making the table and his chest vibrate, intensely. 
Letting his head fall to the side as the hope of some idea crossing his mind started to fade, he became more and more sleepy. His eyelids were refusing to close though, as a misbehaving brat that just didn't want to let his brain rest while it could.

- Cold.

He said, while he was turning the fan off. The weather had become rainy all of the sudden; the meteorology said that it would be like that for the next ten days or so.
Had the bad weather ruined his trip or was it himself? The signs were evident for anyone looking for them, as any sign ever is. But WHAT IF…

- What if….

He’d never know the truth. The bridge falling off, all those accidents in the past few days (even though the road was quite dangerous, STILL that number bothered him a lot), and even the dice with letters that he threw as a joke didn't stop spelling “DEATH” on most of the strokes. Add that to his friend’s mother dream, and there you go. Everything miraculously turns into signs.

- Maybe I should just get that damn bus. The curiosity is killing me.

Should he gamble with his life just to test the mysterious ways that surround us? Or do they? It’s just speculation in the end, as everything beyond the reach of our eyes and ears is. But still the damned “what if” tingled inside his head as the Devil himself was whispering it in his ears. “Let’s just pretend there’s no one talking inside my head and there we go”, he thought.
The song’s mixed up vocal parts didn't help much on that matter: words put on top of other words, to keep the insane climax it has reached in the end. 

“Meshuggah… now THAT’S a good band name.”

His mind wasn’t that idle anymore. Maybe his head’s clock had started to rotate too much without him perceiving it. Seconds later, there was the fan on again.

-Still this is cold wind… but what the hell, I was almost sweating. 

His id was sounding like a lady with that temperature thing, changing his mind on each 5 minutes passed. 

“Was it my id or my ego? Was this a RATIONAL choice based on an irrational arguments that I gave myself or it simply was a 'don’t you even think of dying now' thrown in the air by the animal part of my thinking?” 

He wasn't feeling anything before, really. But then, the fear of screwing all up filled his mind.  His synapses ended up leading him to a semi-irrational reaction. But what lead to that? Was it fear? Was it rational? God only knows.


The Night Before

-Just throw it again man. It’s impossible to get THAT again.
- Here goes nothing…



A moment of silence.




- There's no way we’re doing that man.
- Oh c'mon look at us! We look sound wussies!
- First of all, do you KNOW what will happen?
- No idea. We were invited, so why not going?
- Man, you don’t even KNOW about that thing for sure. That could be all some sick joke.
- Does the four hundred bucks that came along with the letter sound like a joke to you?
- And how the hell do we know that it’s real?
- If these were fake bills and the letter was a joke, it would be a GOOD joke, worth being a part of. Who’d spend MONEY just to send FAKE MONEY around?
- Shit man… I don’t know.
- COME ON!
- Yeah, I think we should just go to check things out. I mean… four hundred bucks just in advance is quite a lot.
- I fucking hate you two.
- THAT’S THE SPIRIT!

And a few drinks after deciding, they went home. And a few hours later his phone rang.

- Man, don’t complain, just turn the fucking TV on

As his eyes started to get in focus again, he saw a 20 feet section of a bridge broken and fallen inside the river. The bridge went up as much as a 13 floor building from the water level. And down below this small truck, that looked almost like a toy.

- Yeah, some drunk fuck didn't watch the road, so what?
- Guess what road that is?
- OUR road?
- Correctamundo.
- Well so what man? They’ll just get a different route and we’ll just spend a couple of hours more on the road. It’s worth the squeeze man, I’m telling ya.
- Well, what the hell… just letting you know. I’ll be getting the tickets in a few hours.
- Ok man, just give me a call and we’ll ride.
- Sure thing, now go back to bed.

In the middle of the word “bed” the phone was already hooked. Not for long.

- FOR FUCK’S SAKE I gotta take some sleep!
- Dude. My mom had a bad dream.
- What? Ah, fuck, I thought it was… but… what? Bad dream?
- Yeah. And I died in it.
- Fuck man… talk about bad omen! Haha!
- I’m not fucking kidding you dude. I’m not going anymore.
- C’mon damnit. Hey, just get ready to take your tickets in a couple of hours and I’ll call you so we can fix things up.
- Dude, NO! … Mother fucker, he hang up on me…





Some five hours later his mind changed.

“That’s it, we’re not going anymore… not for now” 
	
And after setting things up for the delay, he just started to get used to it. And his mind became idle. The light still tingled his eyes when he started to remember the phone number on the back of the business card. Written with a rough, male for sure, cursive type, a name and a phone number.

- Well, in case of any trouble, just call this, he said.

And he did. Before he could say “hello”, the low-pitched voice of an older man on the other side replied

- Yeah, yeah, I know. I’m picking you up in 5.

And the connection was cut.

“What the…”

Precisely five minutes later, he heard a motor humming and a horn, right in front of his house. Looking outside the window, he could see a limousine.  He went outside, and the door opened. The now known voice said “get in kiddo, it’s time to roll”

- Water?
- Oh… yes please. But can you just tell me what’s going on?
- Just drink your water and relax, kiddo.

So he did. And he fell asleep.

Three nights before

- Man, the THREE of us received packages, with the exact same content!
- And all of them mentioned our trip.
- AND it’s on the way there.
- Man, I’m NOT going somewhere just because we receive letters with money offering us a job. You know what kind of job that is, right?
- We don’t have to bring anything man. How is that related to drug dealing?
- Dude... I don’t know. Maybe that’s some sort of code.
- “We’ll have more, you just have to come” is a code for drugs? Where did you take THAT out from?
- Man, I don’t know. This just freaked me out.
- Come on, we can always check how things look like before we jump into this.
- Fuck… okay, we’re doing it.



When that dialogue came to his head in a dream, he woke up. Who knows how much time has passed by? He just knows for sure that there was something in the water. 
Where the hell was his head when he called that man? 
	
“What was I thinking?! I needed the money but hell, that is NOT worth it”

As his cognitive system started to work fully again he felt strangely cold. His legs were numb. He tried to move them with his arms but his arms were tied. A thick rope swirled around his wrists, where he could see small chunks of meat and skin that were ripped from his arm, probably by his own weight.
No cries could describe how he felt, for being so stupid of trusting someone he barely knew.  All of the thoughts of the past few days flooded his head, he could almost see the scenes in the barely visible dark puddle in the darkened room. 
The scent he could get from the ambient was a mix of stone and something he could not remember what it was, 	but he was sure he had already smelled that.

“Iron?”

A quick flash of his childhood came to his mind. One time he was running around, playing with other kids, and he cut his head pretty badly on a loose nail coming out of a board. That smell… the shade of the puddle started to be recognized by his tired brain.
A cold shiver went up his stomach and filled his torso.  Where had this much come from? There was no doubt at that time it was his.

“FUCK!”

Desperately looking in the places he could in his body, he found nothing. Not a trace of a cut. More and more nervous, he started to do almost spastic movements, trying to turn and see what was going on on his back. With that, the ropes just got more and more entwined, causing a sharp sting on his arm that had almost no skin anymore.
The only idea that crossed his desperate mind would simply have to do. He bent down as much as he could, and started to suck the thick red liquid from the puddle into his mouth, as much as he could. He got up again, and pushed his arms back, so he could see his hands. He spat as much as he could over the ropes, which were looser as his weight wasn't strangling his arms anymore. When he started to feel the blood reaching his wrists, he started to pull his arms slowly out of the knot. He prayed for it to work.

I can feel it deep in my very core, and I’m starting to realize that there’s no going back.  I stand in silence, staring at my hands in the flickering light of a faulty fixture, as though evidence that I’m still myself will make things right again.  It doesn’t.  I listen to the sound of my own pulse in my ears: thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump.  It reminds me of the flapping of large membranous wings in the darkness.  As I focus on the sound, I detect a subtle change.  I no longer hear wings, but hoof-beats.  The sound has shifted from inside my head to reverberate around me.  Unmistakable, the galloping of a horse is amplified and distorted by the concrete walls until I am smothered in a sustained resonance.  It’s him.  He’s getting closer.  Oh God, he’s coming for me!  Can this be real?  An insidious whinny punctuates the din.  I run.
            The structure is gargantuan, but we don’t really know how gargantuan.  I sprint down the hall, the sound of my bare feet slapping against the cold concrete floor is drowned out by my cacophonous pursuer, who is quickly closing the gap.  I careen past countless closed doors on either side of the hall.  Occasionally, I catch peripheral glances of faces framed in windows on the doors, illuminated by the cold and indifferent light cast by fluorescent tubes spaced evenly overhead.  Most of the time, the faces seem to be human; wide-eyed, with mouths agape.  Every now and then, however, they grin. 
The hooves are right behind me, and my lungs are searing my chest, but I continue to run.   The horse’s breath reeks of sulfur, and my skin blisters as it alights on my neck.  Eventually, I will need to come to terms with the pain, but there’s no time now.  
I know that turning to catch a glimpse of my pursuer will cause me to lose the single step of advantage that I’ve miraculously managed to maintain.  Consequently, my only warning that he has drawn his weapon is the subtle ‘shink’ of honed metal leaving the leather sheath.  All sound becomes muted, and time slows.  This is it.
But then . . . an open door.
I dive into the darkness and throw my weight against the heavy barrier.  A split second after it slams into place, it is rocked by the force of the hellish equine and its rider.  A pregnant silence prevails before the horse issues a deafening shriek of frustration.  I sit with my knees drawn to my chest and my back against the door, and I listen for several tense minutes as anxious hooves pace back and forth in front of my sanctuary.  Finally, there’s a single clanging strike from the sword on the exterior of the door, and they are gone.
I let my breath come in ragged sobs.  This isn’t possible.  I was always the first to discredit and disprove the ghost stories, but here I am: part of one.  The darkness of the room is palpable, and it feels greasy as it slides over my skin.  I must be on one of the subterranean levels, because the concrete is frigid under my feet.  Sickening dizziness overcomes me and I vomit.  
I realize that, in order to survive, I must move.  I slowly ease the door open and lean my head out.  The hall is silent.  As I pause to decide my next move, icy fingers close around the ankle that I’ve left in the darkness.  In an instant, I trade cognizance for hysteria.  
Eternity passes in a blur.
When I regain control of my actions, I find myself out of breath and on the roof of the building.  Somehow, I have climbed twelve stories without being aware, and I am now leaning against the door that leads to the stairs.      
In between panicked gasps for air, I hear the familiar sound of hooves echoing up the stair-well.  I spin around, scanning the roof for ladders or fire escapes, but there’s nothing.  Finally, my eyes fall on a bridge spanning the gap between my structure and another on the compound.  It must be an original part of the compound, because it is covered in the style of bridges from the turn of the century.  It looks rickety and anachronistic compared to the utilitarian building to which it is attached.  There are no lights in the bridge, yet the darkness seems welcoming.  I am suddenly certain that my only chance for safety lies on the other side.  Behind me, the door handle begins to turn.
I sprint to the bridge . . .

You could say I was crazy, taking her in just like that, but in all honesty, it gave me something to take my mind off the fact that I was nearing thirty five without so much as a whisper of a family. “Hi, I’m Marise!” she casually informed me on the day I met her, grinning wildly as children do. Let me give you some back story. I’m a teacher at the elementary school here in the small town of Coleville, been here all my life. I was reminded all too much that I was lacking a significant other by the kids I teach, but I guess I just never found the right person. Anyway, Marise turned up one day to my class, and by turned up I mean she literally just walked through the door, she wasn’t on any school roll and we couldn’t pry any information about her parents or where she lived out of her. We all felt a bit sorry for her so we decided to let her stay, as she had a keen passion for learning.



Fast forward a few months, after class I get curious and ask again where she stays after school, though this time she breaks her usual confident character, becoming fascinated by her shoes before muttering “I don’t really have anywhere to stay...” What would you do? It’s not as if I can just turn a little girl back to the streets. I drive her back to my place after school on a Friday, wary of how suspicious I must look, even though I do occasionally give my students one on one sessions at my home. She runs through my door as soon as it’s open, jumping onto my couch excitedly yelling “Is this where I get to sleep?” I nod and she seems overjoyed. I wonder what horrible things she must have been sleeping on all these months. 



I began to like having her in the house. In a way she was the daughter I never had. After a while, I began to worry that she did in fact have parents and that they would be terrified, not knowing where their daughter was. One day I confronted her about it while she was drawing, telling her that was important that I know where and who they are. As I finished the sentence I saw her expression change. Her inquisitive features dropped into neutrality. A complete withdrawal of emotion or thought. A cold primal fear clasped my insides. It barely lasted a second before she was back to her smiling self though, laughing the question off and carrying on with her drawing. I was too stunned to push the question again.



And don’t think I didn’t consider going to the police, I almost did on several occasions. I just figured it would be a bad look asking if there were any missing girls in the area, especially considering I had one at my house, and for a few weeks too. I ended up looking online for local missing children, and there were surprisingly many for such a small town, although I had seen on the news that almost all of these kids were found alive, as well as warnings to keep your kids safe, but none were Marise.



I came home from shopping one day to find the house deadly quiet. I figured she was out gallivanting as she often did. I put down the groceries on the counter. A frantic, coarse yell ripped through the house, nearly giving me heart attack. My hearting beating ten times faster than it should have been, I turned around to see Marise standing in the corner of the room, now silent as a mouse, facing the wall. I must have missed her when I walked in. I blurt out “Marise, what’s wrong?” As she turns her head to me I saw that same expression as before, sending ice through my veins. “Nothing.” She smiled.



The next few weeks unnerved me more than anything in my life. I would watch her at school making new friends every day as usual, however only now did I realise that the kids who were going missing were friends of Marise, coming back a few days later, only... different. They lacked the sparkle in their eye, the spring in their step. I loved Marise as I would love my own daughter, but I was simultaneously terrified of her. I chose not to ask questions.



One afternoon I brought back another student, as he was having difficulty with a certain math problem. We were sitting at the table when I excused myself to the bathroom. From inside I could hear Marise talking to him, even laughing with him. I was listening to the sound of their voices when suddenly they both fell silent, and I mean silent. I could not hear a single sound outside the bathroom. I opened the door and saw the kid face down on the desk with Marise right next to him looking at me with her expressionless face. I nearly ran, but I realised I had to get this kid to hospital. I told Marise to wait there, as I put the kid in my car. As I drove off Marise said “I like when you bring other kids round to play!”



The kid awoke from his coma three days later, and doesn’t remember how it happened, and like the rest, he was different. The doctors had no idea what happened, so they told his parents to keep an eye out for any similar incidents. As much as I was scared of Marise, I was even more scared of losing her. I convinced myself that she was troubled and that I could help. After some time I recognised the relation between what she was doing to the kids, and her awful screams and mood swings. The other kids seemed to make her happier. So I brought another child home for tutoring. And another. And another. Each time I told myself this would be the last one she needs.



 I didn’t want to be alone.

The sun was already starting to hug the lands with its warm tentacles. You slowly got up from your wooden bed and reached the old window board. You decide to open the old, rugged window. The winter breeze gently flicks over your skin, sending chills down your spine. Quite expectedly, it seems that you felt bored at this time.

The landscape around your house was beautiful, by the way. The solemn trees proudly guarding the foresty surroundings of your home. You notice the small, slightly bended path leading straight to your “home” from the western side of the clearing.

The words reached your mouth almost unexpectedly. “They will not dare to attack me again, monsters. I taught him a deep lesson last time. Oh, you will not run away again”, you said in a deep, uninterested tone. It was at least a good full month since one of those creatures visited you last time. Time did not make much of a deal to you, why would it? You completely forgot the concept of counting the time, so the only orientation for you now was the Sun itself.

You carefully closed the window blinds and slowly walk back to your hallroom. Your leg hurts a lot, especially since one of these creatures threw a small metal piece into it. It is slowly starting to fade though, behind the thick black, pulsating skin. 

As you arrived at your hallroom, everything seemed as it should be. The flames were cracking in the fireplace, the books were on the old, sturdy shelves, and even the heads of those creatures were there. You seemed to recognize a face of a woman and a young girl, but could not be sure who they were or why you recognize them at all. However, unlike the rest of the ornaments, the heads were getting blacker and increasingly deformed. You were concerned they will never prove to be useful.

Then, you heard it. The very same sound that those monsters bring every time they are ready to confront you. “Why can’t they just leave me alone”’?! You screamed, while reaching the window again. You take a peek through the blinds, and notice them. There were five of these creatures there, holding the very same items in their hands as those that hurted your leg so much. You felt ready for them. They shall trouble you no more.
---------
Reporting Officer William Watson; of the second Phoenix’s PD. We reached the last known suspect’s location. The abandoned house is positioned in the unmarked position in the Western Fields, and seems untouched for years. We will also look for any evidence of attack on our officer who was here a month ago and ran away. We can all agree we feel that a certain thing is watching us. If deemed required, we will call for reinforcements. Officer William Watson out.



Watson placed the radio in his jacket and took out his most trusty companion, the standard police 9mm out of his side-pocket, then yet again looked at old, almost crushed shack. For a moment, he could swear he saw a human face on the window located on the front-side of the shack. The old structure was two stories high, and William had a strong feeling that it could demolish at any moment. It was quite obvious nobody had worked on it in years. A cold drop of sweat touched his hand. It was reported that a suspect killed his wife and two children in this house, and it was on him to investigate. Some rumours even connected the killer with a demonic figure that lived in this house for generations. Watson never believed in paranormal stories, but a speculated dark creature with a human head being so close to him made him nauseous.

As the party of five slowly walked towards the shack, they heard a loud screaming noise. William could swear it felt almost demonic as the rough sound travelled by the wind. They stood on the mud-covered ground for a moment to gather the courage to advance from their position. Garry Sands was the first one to make progress towards the shack. The old companion of Watson, whom he met while was he was attending the academy. That was 17 years ago, and since then Garry has proven himself to be the best friend William Watson has ever had, on or off the police job.

As they cautiously reached the front doors, they heard the wicked scream yet again. William’s hands were covered in sweat. With the group standing in front of the old, wooden doors, Watson had to give the order. They decided to tackle the doors. The doors did not pose a big problem to the officers, since they were half-destroyed even before being bashed on. Whoever is living here did not use them as regularly as you would expect.

When Watson entered the shack, the smell in the air was disguisting. The smell of rotten flesh combined with urine and feces, he thought.  Yet again, he felt very sick. Watson slowly made steps through the dark rooms of the shack, which was seemingly so much bigger than it looked from outside. With quite a few rooms to be covered, they decided to split into groups of two, with William offering to go alone, but cover only the one or two rooms to the straight opposite side of the hallway. The groups split up, and William proceeded to move towards the far end of the hall.

He moved slowly, with the sound of his breath making him even more uncomfortable in the dead silence. He checked every door to his left and right while walking, but most of them ended up being false rooms with just a wall behind the door frame. At this point, Watson could swear he heard a scream from the above floor of him. He decided it was better to not provoke whatever was up there, and stayed quiet.

After what seemed like an eternity, William stepped into a big squary room he was going for the whole time. The room was quite spacey, but very much dark, with the only source of light being the big fireplace on the opposite side of the room. The fire was blazing red, with the sound of cracking wood reaching his ears. He took a quick peek around the room, with the pistol in his sweaty hands. The tall bookshelves made him feel creeped out. The room was physically split down in two parts by the wall on which there were sturdy looking doors. He cautiously reached them, and to his surprise, they were open. He slowly pulled the doorknob down...

Then, he saw them. Eight human heads rotting on a small. what looked like operating table, in the far corner of the room to the room. Some of them were already blacking, with the flesh being disguistingly soft looking. However, one of the heads looked almost intact, he  long hesitated before making the first step to come closer to see... 

A fresh, clearly cut head on the table. The head of Garry Sands. William fell on his knees, just to land into a small puddle of blood. There were no sounds at all at this moment. Just him, and Garry. Or at least what was left of him. Watson started to vomit, with the greenish liquid getting mixed with the blood, resulting in an unbearable smell. 

Then, the fire stopped. The last ink of light was dead, and Watson was now in complete darkness on his knees, in a praying-like stance. A whisper touched his ear, soft and relaxing. “Right on the time.”, your voice said. “A new life for the new beggining. The head of life.” You were relieved you are finally free. A  slow river of red blood started covering the neck of William Watson.

William Watson woke up in his shack, slowly trying to get up. He scratched the thick black fur on his leg. William reached the window and took a slow look at the solemn trees that guarded his home.

I still love you. I probably always will. When the light played off your hair, and the way you smiled... I still melt thinking of it. I often think of how we first met. I had just come home, and you had moved in from down the street. You were gorgeous from the word ""go"". Your long dark hair, your crystal blue eyes, every delicate feature at play. I ran indoors, and had to work up the courage to talk to you. But then again, you beat me to it when you knocked on my door.

You were always good at knowing when things were timed just right.

I could tell you really liked me, too. I'm not much to look at, I know. But I guess we were meant to meet. After that, you would come over, and hang out. Watching movies, playing games. When your parents were out of town, I'd sneak over and waste the night with you. Remember the time the house was struck by lightning, and your roof caught on fire? You screamed and panicked really badly. You were so afraid your parents would catch us, and blame me for trying to burn down the house! Thankfully, I ran home and got a hose and put it out. Even when your parents came home early, I made the excuse that you had run over and got my help, which kept them appeased.

I quickly kissed you goodnight when they weren't looking.

After that, we spent so much time together. I told your parents I offered to be your ""tutor"", and really did help you with school. But I guess I should have seen what was going on after that. You started becoming cold, not returning my calls or barely talking to me. In fact, I knew something was wrong when I saw some other boy walking out of your house. The next day I asked you about it, and you told me that you were thinking about your situation, and how maybe I was a mistake. I was on the verge of tears. Here we were, on the edge of nearly a year together, all the things I did for you, all the things I decided not to ask for, and being respectful and everything ANY GIRL COULD WANT, and I was the one who was the mistake?! I couldn't help myself when I stormed out of the house!

Then you started to torment me.

Every day, you would come over. In less and less clothing. Openly flirting with me! Openly MOCKING me! And I could do nothing, or else draw suspicion! Every time, I asked, I BEGGED you to stop, and your automatic response? ""What would my parents have to say about what we've been doing?"" You kept crushing my heart, over and over, and you wouldn't stop.

Then you brought your friends into it.

Mocking me. Flirting with me. Showing open contempt for me. You used me, and every time you reminded me of it, I died a little more each time. Until tonight, when I asked you to come over. You made the most of it, didn't you? Makeup, black and pink bikini, nice shoes, hair in pigtails, bubble gum, everything. You wanted to see me cry, and you did. Every single word, every barb, everything was orchestrated. You said that this was the greatest moment in your life. The realization of the ""secret power"" you had, and how you reveled in every second of my torture. I was just a place holder for someone more handsome, more refined, and much easier with his money.

You turned around, strutting your body, and saying that no boy could fuck you like you had fucked me.

Until I fucked your gut with the knife when you turned back, that is.

Your eyes were so wide. Did it feel like what that boy did to you? Did it feel like every time you ruined my pride? Ruined my hopes? Ruined everything that I gave for you? THAT I DID FOR YOU?! I kept thrusting and thrusting, your eyes dilating wider. I could tell you felt an explosion of pleasure. The way you shuddered with each piercing stroke, I'm sure of it. Like every night, when you would cuddle close to me, and the feeling of my fingertips on your thigh. The sensation of my lips behind your ear. The feeling of my breath on your neck line. I know all the signs, honey. We were together for about a year.

Then, like each time, you closed your eyes, and went slack. But I knew that this time, you wouldn't wake up. And I was okay with that. After all, I gave you the ultimate sensation, didn't I? No other boy could give you a thrill like that. No, not a boy. A MAN. Because that's what I am. I gave you something you would never forget, and you will never be forgotten for it. All that's left now is to clean up, and get you home. After all, tomorrow is going to be known for 3 milestones.

You start 6th grade. It's our one year anniversary. And my 42nd birthday.

Original can be found here: http://www.crappypasta.com/the-toy-gun/
__________________________________________________________

In the summer of 93, I turned 7 years old. My older brother had turned 7 two years earlier, and for my seventh birthday, he gave me his old BB gun. A Rejunco Actuator. I didn't know who Rejunco was, or for that matter what an ""actuator"" was either, but all I know was that it was something he hadn't played with in a long while, was made of faded aluminum with bright red highlights down the sides and on the handle, and was heavy to hold. Anyone who didn't know better would swear that it was a real gun. Mom objected to him giving it to me, but Dad said that things like the gun were a natural want of a boy my age. I didn't care that it was a gun, myself. It looked so rad, and that's the only thing that mattered.

After all the presents were opened, my brother took me outside to teach me how to shoot it. He grabbed some empty cans from the kitchen, led me to the backyard, and set up the targets.

""Now, the idea is to be precise. To be precise, you need intention. That means you have to mean to hit something, okay?"" He lifted his arms, prompting me to copy him. ""You have to mean for something to fall down, so the idea is to line the little piece on top of the barrel, called the sight, and make it look like it's on top of the intended target. When you feel like you have a good aim, you squeeze the trigger, and let the gun do the rest.""

I felt extremely anxious to wield something like this. It was so cool to the touch, and rather comfortable to hold, that I couldn't help but shake a little bit. Bro could see how I was shaking so much, that he grabbed the top of the Actuator, and pushed it down slightly. I looked at him, wondering why he was so glum looking. He sighed deeply, shaking his head.

""Calm down,"" he told me. ""You need to be calm when you want to shoot. Otherwise, bad things happen that you don't want to happen.""

I pulled the gun back, and proceeded to look at it again. I noticed something I should have seen earlier.

""How do you load this thing?"" I asked.

""That's partly why I got bored of this thing,"" he replied. ""I never learned how to load it up, so I just gave up my interest in the thing entirely. I was your age when I got it, so I figured that you'd want it as well. Now, calm down and focus.""

He took his hand off the barrel of the gun, and stepped back. I took a deep breath, and took a can in my sights. I looked down the barrel, and aimed as best as I could. I felt the trigger slowly give as I squeezed it, and the quick jerk of the mechanism on top shocked me enough to distract me from the sound of the pop as it fired. I was elated when I saw the can fall down, struck hard from the pellet that hit it. I jumped up and down, hoping for my brother to realize I did something on my own for the first time in my life.

I stopped immediately when I realized that he was holding a gun of his own, darker colored and rattling with the sound of the pellets inside. I was so preoccupied with my aim that I never saw my brother step behind me, taking aim with his own bb gun. He waited with me, and as I pulled the trigger, so did he, firing simultaneously. He knew the thing wasn't loaded, so he took aim with his own gun, knowing that even if it was loaded, I was almost guaranteed to miss the can anyway. So he pulled a big brother trick and shot the can for me.

""You can't hit something, unless you have something to shoot it with."". he said, walking towards me. ""Keep that in mind, okay? I gave you this, so that you could practice on your aim. If you can aim, come to me, and I'll let you use my gun. Until then, use this. And... happy birthday, bro.""

With that, he rubbed my head, and ran back inside. I looked the gun over and over, trying to figure out where I could load the thing, when I heard something jump onto the fence. It was Mrs. McKinna's cat, Mitsy. Mitsy was a general nuisance to the neighborhood (like the time Mitsy got into our car during the previous summer, and went to the bathroom all over the driver seat), and always mean to everyone except Mrs. McKinna herself. It was safe to say that no one on the block liked Mitsy, not even me. So I decided to practice using Mtisy as a target.

""Stupid cat! I'd be funny if she just fell off there!"", I thought to myself.

I proceeded to take aim at Mitsy, and lined my sight directly onto her. I slowed my breathing, and steadied myself, and took careful aim at her. I could still feel her claws in my shoulder from when she jumped on top of me three days prior, and scratched me from my shoulder to partway down my upper arm. Mitsy always jumped on me. Didn't matter where, didn't matter when. From my roof on a rainy day, to a tree in the middle of summer. I hated that cat, and I'm sure that cat hated me. So I took my time, and began squeezing the trigger.

""FALL. DOWN. You stupid cat!""

The trigger finally gave way, and the slide moved towards the hammer, and with a loud ""POP!"", the slide shot forward. I could feel some kind of force push out of the gun, and jostled back, but I could see something else: Mitsy looking like she had been hit by something, HARD. She didn't jump off the fence. More like she fell off to the side, and rolling into the air, fell into the bushes belonging to Mrs. McKinna. I ran around the fence just in time to see Mitsy running off towards her home, and sighed in relief that I hadn't actually hurt her. So in my relief, I ran back to the house, and finished my birthday party.

When it came time for bed, I put my gun in my dresser, got changed, climbed into bed, and fell asleep quickly. I must of been asleep about 4, maybe 5 hours, when I heard a loud ""POP!"" coming from my dresser. Honestly, it spooked me quite a bit. Nothing like a sudden, loud noise to pull you out of whatever dream you were in. I sat up, and rubbed my eyes, checking to see if the sound would happen again. When I only heard silence, I knew I could go back to bed, so I laid back down, and fell asleep.

The next morning, I was supposed to go to Baseball practice, so I could changed and headed out the door. That's when I saw Mrs. McKinna, talking with my parents. Apparently, Mitsy climbed up onto their bed last night, meowed rather loudly, threw up blood onto her husband, and then fell over, dead. She was in tears, and when she checked to see if something had attacked her, she couldn't find anything. So here she was, crying over her cat, while mom and dad were trying to comfort her.

All I could think of, was how glad I was that stupid cat could no longer hurt me. So I hopped on my bike, and rushed off to practice.

After I got home, I ran to my room, grabbed the Actuator out of the dresser, and ran downstairs to practice some more. I let mom know that I was going outside, and that I'd stay in the yard. She said it was okay, and to be careful, and I said I would. I dicked around with the gun, pretending I was a good guy, blowing away criminals.

""Take that!""

""I just blew your mind!""

""Hasta la vista, bay-beh!""

Every line you could think of, I said it. I was just imagining that I had the boss in my sights, imagining a burning building, saving my mom, when a bird broke through my concentration. A bluejay had landed in a nearby tree, and was so loud, that I couldn't get back into. I couldn't help myself. I began yelling at the thing to shut up. I kicked the tree it was in. I even threw some rocks, but no matter what I did, it wouldn't stop. So, taking my finger off the trigger, I pointed the Actuator at the bird, and promptly began yelling at it.

""If you don't shut up, I'm going to MAKE YOU ST-!""

*POP!*

The gun kicked back, and I felt some kind of force exit the gun. And out of the tree, the bird fell down. I rushed over, and immediately could feel my eyes well up. I looked at the bird, lying still, and motionless. I began to cry as I tried to beg the thing to get up. It wasn't my fault it fell down. The gun went off on it's own. I didn't even pull the-

""Now, the idea is to be precise. To be precise, you need intention. That means you have to mean to hit something, okay?""

My brother's words ran in my head. I had to MEAN to hit something? I began to cry harder now. It was MY FAULT the bird was dead. I thought I had to pull the trigger to cause something to fall down? I... I didn't want the stupid thing anymore. I didn't want to hurt anything. I didn't want anything to die-

Mitsy. Oh god, I had killed Mitsy. I didn't want to KILL Mitsy! I just wanted to scare her. To make her fall off the fence! Not die! At that point, I just LOST IT. I dropped the gun, and ran into the house. My dad was inside, watching the TV, and I ran to him. I told him about the bird, and about Mitsy, and that the gun could shoot things, but it didn't need to be loaded, and I was to blame. I cried and cried, trying to get him to believe me, so he got my mom, and they proceeded to comfort me. As she tried to get me to calm down, he went outside with a plastic bag, proceeded to get the gun, wrapped up the bird, and when he was inside, threw the bird away, and put the gun in his desk.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I had killed two things, and I didn't mean to do it at all. Finally, I had to use the bathroom, so I hurried down the hall, did my business, and tried to sneak back to my room.

*POP!*

It was the same noise I heard the previous night. And I finally recognized what the noise was: the Actuator's firing mechanism. I sneaked past my parent's room, and into the living room, where dad's desk was, by the front window. I quietly began opening the drawers looking for it, when I could hear a subtle *click* from the second one on the left. Pulling it open, I saw in the moonlight that the gun was primed, ready to fire. I slowly tried to reach into the drawer, to see what was causing the gun to move on it's own, when-

*POP!*

The noise was loud, and I knew it woke up my parents, so in my panic, I slammed the drawer close, and rushed back to bed. I dove under the covers, and tried to get myself to calm down. I didn't touch the damn thing for almost a month after that. I wasn't going to touch that damn thing again, even if my life depended on it.

Unfortunately, my life didn't depend on it.

3 weeks after my birthday, one of my friends, Marla, asked if she could come over for a sleep over. Naturally, I begged my parents, and they said it was okay. So the next day, Marla's mom dropped her off, and we proceeded to do what any other kids our age usually do. We played games, watched movies, had ice cream sundaes, and camped out in the living room. It was near bedtime, and we had just gotten changed into our pajamas, when I saw Marla in my dad's desk.

In the second drawer on the left.

I ran over, and begged her to leave it in there, but she wouldn't listen. She heard something in there, and wanted to find out what. And that's when she pulled the Actuator out, cocked and ready for use. I begged her to put it back, but she wouldn't listen. She was enamored with it, pretending to blow away bad guys, and was having to much fun with it. So I... I dove for it. She fought back, trying to get it away from me, telling me that she had a right to play with it. But I wouldn't listen. I pulled and pulled, but she wouldn't budge. She twisted the gun, pointing it at herself in the process, directly at her head. I screamed for her to leave it alone, that it will hurt her if she doesn't put it back, but she wouldn't have any of it.

""GO AWAY-""

*POP!*

Marla's head shot back, and she let go of the Actuator. Her body fell over itself, falling like a doll. Her eyes went glassy, and her skin began to get pale.

""MOM!""

I turned to look at my brother, standing in the hallway.

""MOM! DAD!""

I heard my parents stomping down the hallway, expecting to be annoyed. What they saw was him, staring at me, kneeling down beside Marla, trying to get her to wake up, with the Actuator lying beside her. I couldn't stop crying, as mom called 911, and dad tried to comfort me. but when the EMT's got there, they announced they were too late. Marla's parents were called, and told that Marla had died in an accident. Everyone was in shock, especially me. The Actuator killed one of my friends, and we didn't even have our hands on the trigger.

At Marla's funeral the next week, it was an open casket reception, and we were given our final chances to say goodbye to her. I wanted to go last, and waited until I had my chance. As everyone proceeded to go to the graveyard, I hurriedly pulled the Actuator out from my jacket, and laid it in with her.

""You're the last person that should be hurt by this stupid thing."", I said, in between tears. And quickly ran outside to her internment. And that's the last time I thought I'd see the damn thing. But the internet has a bad way of reminding people of their past.

Two years ago, my brother committed suicide. Marla's death lead to a wealth of emotional issues, which eventually lead to drug abuse. He just couldn't get over the fact that the gun, with no way of loading it, had killed Marla. That idea ate away at him, until one day, he apparently killed himself. I had wanted to forget that, until I was visiting /b/ on 4chan, and I saw a picture of him as the opening post to a thread, taken by crime scene photographers, slumped down on the floor. And in his hand, lay a dirty gun. It was made of faded aluminum, with bright red highlights down the sides and on the handle.

And the poster wrote: ""So, does anyone know who makes the Rejunco Actuator? Got one for sale, slightly used, only used to An Hero once. Works really nicely. Totally untraceable.

It was only a few days past my 6th birthday and I was still wetting the bed. The stink of piss mixed with sweat greeting me as I arose. It was that dream again. It seemed to be happening nightly now. In my dream I would wake up and need to go to the toilet. When I get there, there would be a dead animal in the bowl. Tonight it was a rat. Every time, as soon I seen the animal, things would go insane. Doors would start banging, windows would open and shut, the front gate would screech. It was like some mad spirit flexing it’s muscles. The blood. The blood of the animal would be splattered everywhere. Now wonder I was wetting the bed. Any child would after that. Wouldn't they? Or at least that's what my doctor told me.

This morning I decided to try and wash them before mother woke up. For some reason she was always quiet on mornings when I wet the bed. It was like she knew what I had done, even before I had woken up. This morning she was already awake cleaning the toilet. Without looking at me, she said “Just hurry up and put them in the wash.” I couldn't hide anything from her.

As I poured a bowl of cereal she came in, her face weary with being up so early doing the daily chores. “Did you dream last night?” She always knew when I had the dream. I hadn’t told her about them in the beginning. It wasn’t until she took me took me to the doctors for my bladder problem that she begun the ask about the dreams. “Yes” “Can you describe it to me?” she asked. I still felt wrong discussing these dreams. They felt so personal to me. For some reason I had begun to look forward to them. According to my doctor I was having night terrors. I didn’t understand what a night terror was but if it was anything similar to a nightmare, then that wasn’t what I was having. I always got a thrill just when I was about to peek around the toilet door. How much blood would there be this time? The first time I told my mother, I would never forget the look on her face. Disgust mixed with fear. Obviously I had told her the wrong answer so I made sure to tell her it frightened me this time. I know you're not supposed to lie to your mother, but it almost made her happy when I told her this, or at least a little more relaxed.

That night I set in front of the fireplace. I was told that some children like to watch TV in the spare time. Those children must not have a fireplace. As I watched the flames dance I wonder what I would dream tonight. Wouldn’t it be interesting if a person ever showed up in the toilet?",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_19eunj,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/19eunj/prologue_the_recurring_dream/,

He had no friends other than his dog, named Jake. He would tell Jake everything that came into his mind and over time he created an imaginary world that he would talk about with jake - a world where inanimate objects were his friends and everyone loved and adored him.

Only a short year down the track of this world being created, Jake the dog passed on from old age. Finn was so distraught and left with no one, he spiralled into a deep depression and got worse and worse. Seeing no way out of his hellish nightmare, and incapable of thinking rationally, Finn the human took an overdose of prescription drugs, putting him into a coma, a coma that doctors and his mother feared he would never wake up from. 

In Finns comatose mind, he sees the world he once dreamed of with his dog. Jake is his best friend who can talk and has the power to stretch and mould into anything, while Finn is a 13 year old boy hero who saves princesses and is loved by everyone for who he is. He always does good and is never seen as evil - he is truly happy. Jake the dog has a girlfriend, a rainbow unicorn, who can bend colour to her will, and she speaks a language that only Jake can understand. There is an evil man known as the Ice King who is extremely depressed and possibly even schizophrenic, although he says everything he sees is because of his ""wizard eyes"". The Ice King kidnaps princesses and tries to forcefully make them love him, because he is so alone. It is possible that the Ice King is simply a depiction of how Finn may have ended up if he grew to old age in the real world.

Unfortunately Finn the human lays in his hospital bed, hooked up to life support, slowly rotting away day after day. Although he may be happy in his dream world, he is truly a lost, scared and sad little boy.

Found his wife's picture, taken from its shelf.

Because this hadn't happened for at least a whole year.

The last man on Earth ran for a while,

On and on, mile after mile.

When he saw a cabin like his someone --some*thing*-- had made.

Silent he crept, more quiet than a mouse.

Ran into a man who was his own clone.

And killed himself, then sat for an age.

A light in the woods, right above a tree.

(Family over there). I went out at least 3 times a week, meeting different people and having different experiences. One of those nights, I met up with a girl, and she seemed really cool. Had a couple of drinks and had some great laughs. So after that, she decided to walk home, which wasn't far. I stepped out with her, and saw her leave, up until she turned into a very unknown and strange shop.

She went in there, as there were no lights turned on. I've never seen anyone go in there before either. So I slowly go up to the shop, and it says 'closed.' I obviously couldn't ignore the sign, so I slowly creeped open the door. I walked around hesitantly and noticed that there was another door open with a small light. I look down the stairs, and hear some Japanese conversations going on. The most fucked up part? You could hear a buzzsaw noise in the background.

As I slowly creep down, I see a clear trashbag of blood. Red and pure blood. I choke up a bit, but continue into the other room, where I'm introduced with cut-up limbs hanging from the ceiling. Not only that, but I spot the girl that I met lying on a table naked, getting her intestines mutilated by a Japanese man in a lab coat with a buzzsaw in his hands. She was obviously dead, and I had no choice but to sprint outta there.

The moment I sprint out into the dark, I continue back into the bar where we were drinking, and there is not a single person at the bar. The lights are still on, but no bartender, and no guests. I step in, turn around, and I'm greeted with a message written in blood.

My mother wanted to clean the house and get things ready so I was to stay with grandma. I tried to keep her in good spirits as she seemed so solomn, avoiding cracking jokes with me and staying silent. I tried to think little of it as she had essentially been given a death sentence, and after about a half hour, she started smiling again, seemingly over it. ""I've been waiting for a chance to tell someone this,"" she said. 

She explained that when she was in her early teens, she started working as a volunteer at an institution in South Carolina. They were severely understaffed, and had to have many untrained nurses and volunteers to even operate. She added that their license to be a hospital facility had probably been forged, and it was at a time when inspectors were not taken seriously and could easily be bribed. 

You avoided working late at night if you could, but sometimes it was unavoidable because they had to ensure that all of the patients stayed in their rooms. The grounds themselves were already old, decaying, and dangerous, having formerly been used as an early manufacturing plant. It would frighten you to go through the rounds because often you had nobody with you. There were long, turning halls, seemingly without end, and usually without much light because there was no money to replace light bulbs. Instead, you were given a kerosine lamp, and had to walk the hallways late into the night. 

It was not unusual for the patients in the facility to be treated with experimental medicine which we would consider barbaric. It caused horrible side effects such as insomnia and hallucinations which made them hurl themselves at the light of the kerosine lamp. They groaned and garbled language, throwing themselves at the bars of their rooms until their blood and hair covered it. Some even knocked their own teeth out against the bars, and violently pulled against them like animals. Most of the glass windows were broken, and patients often tried to use the glass to injure themselves or you. 

One night she had been badly shaken after a few rough encounters with patients so she took refuge in the room where they kept all of the tapes and the interviews with patients. One patient in particular kept repeating one unnerving phrase. She whispered to herself, ""When it is night, and the sun still burns, what is right, you'll soon learn; when bones are twisted without force, listen for sounds of remorse."" Then she shivered in the cold darkness. The room was dark except the light of a small screen and a couple blinking white lights around the room, showing power to all of the instruments. The small television screen was paused on an interview with a patient. My grandmother said that she thought about leaving and that she should have just passed it by, but she didn't. 

Growing up poor in a rural county, it takes her a few moments to get the tape to play right, so at first, she thinks she's made a mistake. The tape begins to play, but it has no sound. The patient is a girl with a buzz cut and bald headed in some places. Odd for the quality of the tape, the room was in incredible detail and you could clearly see words on the back wall, yet strangely the image of the girl was blurry and wavy. A name displayed itself briefly at the bottom of the screen: Noleta Raybern. You cannot see her face when the tape begins, but as it plays on, after about 20 seconds, she looks up to the interviewers and you see a horribly disfigured face with most of the nose and eyelids gone, as well as a good portion of her jaw. Her eyes are black and one rolls freely, unattached, and her mouth moves awkwardly, so you can tell she is speaking, but all that comes out of the speakers is a low humming noise and a lower sound that sounded kind of like an engine revving.

There is static audible over the sound and the frames of the video begin slowing down, skipping over each other. It goes to a picture of a group of girls standing in front of a machine, and my grandmother realizes that the girl is among them. This plays for a few frames, then cuts back to the patient. Suddenly, the girl is standing, but her bones are strangely crooked, like they should be bent out of her skin. She walks around the chair then several frames are missing and it goes black as the audio of the interviewer resumes without warning from the hum, ""mmMany people have you told about what happened to you?"" There is a wheezing sound that can only be taken as laughter, a laughter of someone whose vocal cords had been stretched to the point of snapping and scorched by heat. ""Everyone.."" Then it goes black again for a few seconds. My grandmother said she almost ran out then, but felt like a force had her pinned to the chair. 

When the video resumes itself, the girl is staring, black eyes and all into the camera. ""Everyone is going to know what happened to me,"" More wheezing, static, and revving. Then laughter, distorted to the point of demon possession comes over, and the interviewer replies, ""Get her out of-"" And the static humming replaces the rest, with a picture of what looked like the aftermath of an explosion. The power lights in the rest of the room are suddenly gone. My grandmother realizes that the humming is actually a hymn sung after what was supposedly a lab disaster. As she continued watching, the interviewer says, ""She's bluffing. She's the only one that knows-"" The picture distorts, then appears to switch to a different point of view showing the interviewers lips moving without any sound. Then the sound gets very loud, ""The lab radiation from the fusion experiment had horrible side effects, but that's a price I'm willing to p-"" The tape then cuts short and cuts to the picture of the girl staring at the camera with low screaming and loud revving in the background, and a text across the screen that flashes, ""When it is night, and the sun still burns, what is right, you'll soon learn; when bones are twisted without force, listen for sounds of remorse"". The camera then pans out to the phrase on the wall.

My grandmother said she screamed and ran out of the room and never came back. Although later she mentioned the tape to a friend who had gone into the interview room, he said he never found such a tape. The only evidence was a blank tape with the name NRMD scribbled out on the front. The facility was shut down some three years later after patients began complaining of burns and stomach pains. The entire community was stunned when an investigator announced that it appeared that they had all succumbed to radiation poisoning. 

A few days after we left, my grandmother died in a bizarre house fire which burned down her entire estate. I don't know if what she told me was true or not. Maybe my grandmother was suffering from impending-death delirium, and maybe there was truth to what she said. Maybe she was the one who caused the fire. I'd like to believe that it was all in her imagination.. however, I have just received an email from the South Carolina Mental Health Institute containing a photo of a girl missing a face, standing in front of a wall that behind her reads, ""Never forget"".

But people at school have been talking about sending letters to random people is much more enjoyable. So we tried that and we sent around 10-15 letters before giving up. I was mad from this so I sent one calling someone a very rude names. I wasn't expecting a letter back but sure enough I got one.
""Jake, You got a letter!""
""Really?"" I shouted back from my room.
""Yeah!""

I ran downstairs and grabbed it from her hands ripping it open. I was, more than stunned. The letter had a note that gave an address to somewhere nearby. I called up my Seth telling him we needed to go. It would be dark when we were able to leave so we brought flashlights.

We got on our bikes and started to leave, the trip took 10 minutes and when we finally got there. It was a small house near a forest and there was no other houses for about 900 meters. Since we loved pranks we decided to knock on the door than run and hide in the bushes. No answer, we climbed up on a log sitting at the side of the house to look through the window. Most of it was dark except for a small candle sitting on top of a table. But wait! There was also a note near the candle.
""We need to get it"" Said Seth.
I agreed so me and Seth tried opening the door but it was locked. We had to crawl through the window.
""You go in, I will wait out here in case anyone comes back"" Laughed Seth. I knew he just didn't wanna go in but I couldn't say anything back. It was true, someone did have to keep watch.

I crawled through the broken window and took out my flashlight. There were, TONS of doors. They were all over the place but I didn't care at all I just wanted to take the note and get the hell out of there.

The next day we opened the note because we were way too scared to open it near the house. The note had writing, I said out the words.
""Please write back, -Someone You WILL Know""
Seth just dropped his jaw, so did I. What did this mean? I was mostly scared because the letter was capitals on the ""Will"" part. I told Seth I was not going to write back so he asked if he could keep the letter. I said he could.

Three days after that I was eating at home with my mother when I got a knock on the door. It was Seth, but his face was sweating and looked very disturbed. I stepped outside to talk to him and he started yelling at me.
""DUDE! I sent a letter back and-""
""WHAT? Why would you send one back?!""
""Just listen man! I'm sorry but as soon as I sent it I got one back as a reply""
""So?"" I said in a fake gasp.
""No, I mean that right when I put it in the post box I got one back""
""What?!""

The letter Seth sent simply said ""Come at me"" and when he got a letter back right before the letter even sent witch was crazy as is because the first letter I sent wasn't from his place. The letter he got said ""I was already here"". I sent a letter back but not because I wanted to keep doing this.

I sent a letter saying ""Leave us alone"". It took a while for a response but I finally got one about two weeks later.

The next part, I kept from Seth to save him the effect I had. The letter said ""Your in my spot"" Witch brought me fear and confusion. But it only made it worse when I read the address. It was mine.

I remember despising kindergarten. I went to Duggan Elementary School in Farner, Tennessee. Naturally, I
hated it. But how I felt about that place by the end of the year went beyond simple loathing. Obscure memories of those days still resurface in my mind from time to time. I remember hearing, and seeing things that I was too young to understand. I just have these vague images and sounds in my head that I can barely recall. I don’t have nightmares

There was something about him that seemed… well he didn’t seem very child-friendly. He drove a long white van to school every day. It was called it “the stupid van” because the kids all hated him. Mr. Arata was irritable and cross, but he sure knew how to act when he was being watched by other teachers or the principal.
One day, at my house, I remember my mother telling me that one of my classmates had gone missing. She was
watching the news and was, understandably, very upset. When a second child in my class went missing, my mother abruptly pulled me out of school. She told me that she would send me back when it was safe. I thought it was great, not being in school. I was too young to understand what a child’s disappearance could actually mean… too naive
to think about it realistically. I remember that, after a while, I went back. The kids had been found, but they did not go back to school for whatever reason. I heard one of my fellow students tell me that the kids who had disappeared had no recollection of what had happened. She said that they had been “cut open under the belly button and stitched up.” She knew those two kids well. I think her name was Katy or Kitty or something. I just assumed that she was lying through
her teeth. Even as a six-year-old, I wasn’t credulous enough to believe something like that.
Later on in the year, I remember the girl (let’s just call her Katy) talking about how one of the kids who had previously gone missing had passed away. She took a week off from school because of it. Apparently, she had kept in touch with the two kids after they switched schools. Katy said that the child had been sick ever since they found him with no memory. At this point, I thought she was making up more lies to get attention, but she did genuinely seem miserable now that I think of it. Little kids aren’t that great at acting.
I remember that one day, I had a terrible nightmare. The day started out normally. I remember going to lunch, and… I think I remember getting up to leave after the bell had rung to return to class. I’m not sure what happened next because
that’s the last thing I remember before having the nightmare.
Suddenly, I was on a table, strapped down. I could see tinted windows on the narrow walls by my side… everything was pretty dark. I was in a very cramped rectangular room. I just sat there for a moment. Clearly, I remember looking about and feeling the straps on my wrists and ankles. I looked to the side of me, and there was a tray with surgical instruments on it. I did not know how I got there in the first place. I was confused and on the verge of tears. A man dressed like a doctor came to see me. I couldn’t make out his face because it was so dark there. He just looked at me for a moment, then he turned on a bright light that was mounted over top of me – like the kind they use when you go to the dentist. He was wearing a doctor mask and had a blank expression on his face. I was stunned with fear. He casually reached for a scalpel, and grabbed one from the tray. I began screaming and crying. He looked slightly taken back. The man uttered a few words, but I couldn’t make out what he was saying.
I awoke to the harsh scolding of Mr. Arata. I was lying down asleep on the bleachers in the gym where we would wait for our bus numbers to be called. He was telling me that I had fallen asleep and missed the bus. He took me back to his class,
and called my mother to come pick me up. I started crying as soon as I had time to think about the dream. He didn’t try to comfort me; he didn’t even ask me what my problem was. He just stared at me. I told him that I had experienced a terrible nightmare, and he… he nodded at me… at least, I think he did. My mother spent the whole day trying to reassure me. The most disturbing part is, I usually wake from a nightmare as soon as I began feeling terror. But this… I was screaming and thrashing about for an extended amount of time. It all seemed real.
I was convinced over the years that I had hallucinated. I began getting homeschooled because I was extremely terrified of going back. My parents couldn’t understand how a nightmare could cause someone to have the kind of issues that I had. I had a few dreams about the experience. It wasn’t like I was having a reoccurring nightmare… it was as if these nightmares were much less real than my original nightmare. They were just the original experience in dream form.
They say that the sense of smell is the best way to remember something. Years later, when I was a grown man, I
visited my grandfather in the hospital. There was something about the smell that brought me back. It made me think about that dark room. I went over to my parents’ house and flipped through some of the old photo albums, looking for anything to help ease my curiosity. While I was looking through the photo album, I found a picture of the class and Mr.
Arata . It had some writing on the back, but it wasn’t in English. Arata is a Japanese name, so I guessed that that was what language it was. I knew that one of my Dad’s friends spoke Japanese, so I took the photo to him, and he translated it for me. I looked underneath the original text to see the scribblings that the man had left. The translation said, “I had a great time working on you this school year.”
I went back to the photo album and started rabidly searching through it. I didn’t want my dream to be a reality, but I had to know for sure. There were photos of me performing all kinds of activities. I even found photos of the time
that my mother brought the class cupcakes for my birthday. Almost every picture had Mr. Arata in it, with a stern look on his face. I held one picture in my hand(a picture that my mom took of me during a school play)and it seemed thicker than the others. I noticed tape on the edge of the picture. Two pictures had actually been taped together. I took a knife and cut the two pictures apart. What I saw haunted me. Underneath the regular picture was a picture of a small boy strapped to a table in the dark. I compared the picture with the other ones and… it was me. I looked on the back of the picture of the play (the back was originally facing the picture of me on the table) and it had more Japanese writing on it. I had to sit down. The dread and paranoia was coming back to me. I took the writing to the same man who had translated the first note. He seemed quite confused by what he read.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_vt87l,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/vt87l/arata/,

1324193813.0,15,self.creepypasta,nh5uc,Doors,XanCrews,16,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/nh5uc/doors/,"I was adopted. I never knew my real mother; rather, I knew her at one time but I left her side when I was too little to be able to remember. I loved my adopted family though. They were so kind to me. I ate well, I lived in a warm and comfortable house, and I got to stay up pretty late.

Let me tell you about my family real fast: First, there’s my mother. I never called her Mom or anything like that; I just called her by her first name. Janice. She didn’t mind at all though. I called her that for so long, I don’t think she even noticed. Anyhow, she was a very kind woman. I think that she is the one who recommended my adoption in the first place. Sometimes I would lay my head against her in front of the television and she would tickle my back with her nails. She is one of those Hollywood mothers.

Second, there’s Dad. His real name was Richard, but he never really liked me much so I began to refer to him as Dad in a desperate attempt to gain his affection. It didn’t work. I think that no matter what I called him, he would never love me as much as his own child. That’s understandable so I really didn’t press the matter. The most notable attribute of Dad was his unmoving sternness. He was not afraid to pop his children when they did something wrong. I found that out before I could use the restroom properly. He didn’t hesitate to spank me. Well, I’m in line and it’s because of his methods.

Lastly, is my sister. Little Emily was really young when I was adopted, so we were about the same age, but she was slightly older. I liked to think of her as my little sister, though. We got along better than any sibling could possibly get along. We would always stay up late together and just talk. Well, she did a lot of the talking; I mostly just listened because I loved her. It was a great setup that we had! We were short on bedrooms, so- because I didn’t want to sleep in the living room by myself when I was littler- I had a pallet set up for me next to her bed on the floor. This is where I have slept since. But it was cool with me because I enjoyed being with her and I had always felt pretty protective of my little sis.

Everything changed on a horrible Wednesday night. I was at home taking a nap when little Emily opened the front door. The sound of the door opening pulled me to a state of consciousness and I walked from the room down the hall to the living room. That’s when I first remembered it was Wednesday. I was never any good at keeping track of what day it was. Actually I’ll just go ahead and say it: My sense of time was HORRIBLE! But nevertheless, I knew it was Wednesday because Emily had just come home from her Church’s youth group gathering. She walked in the front door and hugged me, and then was followed in by Dad and Janice.

“You have a good nap?” Janice said teasingly as she ruffled up my hair. I just shook my head away and snorted in a manner that clearly expressed that I was teasing back with her.

“Don’t you snort at your mother like that!” said my father gruffly with authority. He shut the door behind him and hung up his coat. “I was clearly joking…” I growled under my breath. He must not have heard me because I didn’t feel him smack me. Emily then proceeded to our room and I followed. She started telling me about her day. You know… usual teenage girl stuff. But I listened so that she would feel better. After her summary she suggested watching TV and I obliged and jumped onto the couch as she was going for the remote. She rolled her eyes at my little-brother-like immaturity and scooted me over and sat down. The TV turned on and we watched it together until the sun went down. Emily was the kind of girl that- instead of watching cartoons and soap operas- would rather watch Discovery and Animal Planet and Natural Geographic. I like those too so I didn’t mind. Actually, those were the only channels that can hold my attention.

So it got late and Janice walked up behind the sofa. “Emily it’s past your bed time. Turn off the television and go to your room. You too.” she pointed at me. Emily turned off the program we were watching grudgingly and stood up. She started down the hallway to our room. As I followed I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

We went into our room and Emily turned off the light. Just as she did, I caught a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye. It was out the window, but as soon as I redirected my line of sight to where the window was no longer in my peripheral vision, what it was that I thought I saw was gone. I still remained alert. For my sister’s sake.

I laid there in the darkness with nothing but the thin ray of light from the street lamp outside to illuminate the room. It wasn’t much. Time and time again I could have sworn that I heard subtle sounds just out the window… a twig break, leaves crunching, clothes jostling, and all the while I could smell a faint stench of sweat and blood. I kept my eyes open most of the night.

The sounds outside subsided and the smell left my nose. I began to feel at ease. My eyelids closed.

Not long after that, I heard a very loud crash on the other side of the house. I was up in an instant. “THERE’S SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!” I barked with extreme adrenaline coursing through me. “Wake up!” I shrilly pleaded with Emily. She did, and as soon as I saw her sit up I ran to my parent’s room…

Dad was dead. His neck was splayed open and gaping as blood spilled out of it, off the bed, and onto the floor. I saw that the master bathroom’s door was closed and just before it- on the outside- was a man.

A man… I don’t feel comfortable calling it that.

He was very large and rugged. He turned around and saw me and that’s when I saw him accurately for the first time. I won't forget it. His eyes were large and beady and trapped with lust. He was styling a beard that was badly unkempt with blood dripping off. His clothes were dirty and his face was cold. Just then I noticed the same horrid smell of sweat and blood from earlier, but this time it was overwhelming.

He saw me. He saw me and grinned with a set of crooked yellow teeth. That smile threw me off. I thought that I was going to die, but then he turned back to the bathroom door completely unperturbed by my presence. I was terrified and didn’t no what to do. I just yelled and cried. I watched as he shouldered through door that was Mom’s only protection. I watched as he raised the large razor that he was carrying, but had obviously neglected to use properly. I watched as he sliced her open and tore her to shreds…

I then heard something; the last thing that I wanted to hear… It was Emily’s scream coming from behind me. The large monstrosity looked up from my butchered mother and stared at my little sister. I was distraught. He stood up and quickly started walking toward us. My sis turned and ran, and I was at a loss when he bypassed me and went straight after her. Why was she still in the house? Had she not assessed the situation and run? Apparently not, and now she was dead and I was alone.

I ran after them both. I expected the man to kill her as he had the rest of my family, but I was sadly mistaken. He grabbed her by the arm and jerked her as a way to make clear that he was in control. He dragged her through the house… I was making all of the noise I could now, hoping and praying that someone would come to my aid. He mustn’t take her. Not her.

As he passed me I backed against the wall and whimpered with terror, “Why?” He didn’t respond except by putting his free hand on my head while Emily screamed in the other and saying “Good boy.” He gave another crooked grin and a very cold, unnatural laugh. I followed him to the door where he dragged my helpless sister after him. He opened it, pulled her out, and slammed it shut behind him.

I am now sitting in the house with my mutilated adopted parents, shivering and whimpering with dismay. He’s out there with her. Doing who-knows-what to her, and I can’t do anything. I would if I could, but I can’t. I would chase after them in a heartbeat, but I can’t. I sit here, looking at the front door. I look down at my paws. If only I could open doors…

Sometimes they are jet black, sometimes they sort of look like a mood ring, other times it looks like a little firework going off and can shoot around a little. I have heard voices in various states of clarity when no one would be home. Most of the time it would be a muffled unintelligible thing, but every once in a while it sounded like it would happen just feet from you. The shadows and the voices go sort of hand in hand.

Being close to one of the shapes felt pretty much like you had your hands on one of those tesla balls they sell at the mall. I know people say there's a ""cold"" associated, but to me it's always been a sort of electric charge. The voices themselves are never crystal clear like sound you hear when talking to someone in a room. The sound is flat - like it's coming through thin drywall or a tiny transistor radio speaker. It has a tendency to pan from ear to ear, so it gets confusing as to where it is actually originating. I've also noticed that during the times this would happen it would feel as if you were entering a bubble or a fog - I suppose the best way to relate this to you would be if you were walking through a room and in an instant someone placed a large tupperware container around you.

For years of hearing this and seeing these shapes I though perhaps I was a little bonkers - that is until one day I was with my father out in the woods on his friends land.

My father hunts turkeys and this particular day we drove to his friends house who has 200 acres of land in Connecticut. We parked by the side of the main road and walked down a logging road about a mile and a half to where a sand pit was. We spent maybe an hour there getting the choke set on the gun (it's a mossberg 10/12 ga conversion) so it had the right spread pattern.

As we were walking back there were these clearings cordoned off by stone walls where cattle used to graze (the region is densely wooded otherwise). We stopped by one of the stone walls on our way back and we saw a wild turkey walking around the back of the field.

I remember saying ""Well, just a few more weeks and that sucker will be yours!""

Just as i finished talking this weird electric buzz came over me and the hairs stood up on my neck. Out of nowhere we both hear:
""Brian! Do you see them, Brian? Do you see them? They're all coming now, Brian! You have to be careful!""

Brian is my fathers name. It was in that same small tin sound that i described earlier. You can't pinpoint where it's coming from - like it's coming through a thin wall.

I looked at my father and his face had both a look of disbelief and fear that was taking over. I asked him if it was the land owner - my father said it didn't even sound like him.

My father said ""Yeah - I see them! What do you want?""

There was no reply.

My father became a little agitated and started yelling to see who was out there. We both searched the area up to the side of a hill and about 200 yards past the back of the field. There was no sign of anyone out there.

To double check, we drove to the owners house (who happens to be in his 80's with a metal joint in his hip) and knocked on his door. He had the flu and said we were nuts if we thought he went way back there.

That's really the end of it. I will say this though - since that happened, things have become exponentially worse for my family, everything from drug addiction to deaths and savings getting wiped out.  I honestly wonder if what we heard was something warning us that tough times were coming - or perhaps malicious forces.

It's not like I didn't understand why my father had to work all the time, but I didn't like it. So many times I'd get home with my little brother to find a note on the fridge, ""Working late again. Feed your brother and be in bed before eight.""

We had recently moved to New Jersey, a street called Havens Cove Road. Our house was the last one before it took a sharp turn and hit a dead end. The house was surrounded by woods; well, I am calling it woods but it was really the edges of the Marsh Baywood Swamp. A relatively expansive wilderness that my father kept telling me not to play in.

It was a Tuesday. I arrived home with Brandon and found another note. Grunting, I tossed it into the trash. I flicked on the television, grabbed a bag of Cheetos and vaulted onto the couch, then I noticed it.

The back door was wide open. My father's shoes, the only pair he had, were sitting on the back porch neatly.I jumped up and walked to the back door, nearly spilling my Cheetos in the process.

""Dad?"" I vividly remember calling him, but whether those were the actual words I used escapes me.

Receiving no response was surreal; while my father did work a lot he never once ignored us while he was home. I instantly got a chill, even though the weather was hot and muggy. I walked into the yard and waved to Brandon to follow. Brandon was still wearing his shoes and Jacket from school so that was a relief.

A crumpled pair of pants lay nearby, and I instantly knew they were my fathers. He had a bad habit of scuffing the pant legs. Once again I called for my father but got no response. I picked up Brandon and stepped through the foliage separating the yard from the swamp beyond and instantly found my fathers hat and tie.

I walked on for maybe fifteen minutes before reaching a part of the swamp where I could go no further. The swampy water had become to deep and the risk of drowning was to much. I would have to turn around and call the police. My father was out there somewhere, and all of my calling was doing nothing except scare my younger bother who now sat on my shoulders.

This area of the swamp was peculiar, but I didn't notice it until I looked up to see how late it was getting. About twenty feet above us hung men's dress shirts. I counted 16 white, pressed, and clean shirts, nailed to trees deep in the Marsh Baywood Swamp. I was one of the most disturbing things I'd seen and I immediately decided to turn and head back.

I tried calling out once more and this time, I got a response. I once again can't be sure of the exact words, but I'll try my best.

""She just wants to decorate her new home. I'll be okay, go home and make your brother some dinner.""

I spun to see my father climbing a tree a distance ahead; In the area I couldn't travel to because of the water.

""Dad, come on. Let's go home. You're scaring me."" I watched as the skin of his leg caught on a branch leaving a long scratch that immediately started to bleed. My father ignored it as he kept climbing.

""She's going to get mad if you stay. You need to go. Go home. I'm just helping her decorate."" He reached into a knot in the side of the tree and pulled out a long metal nail. He leaned against the tree and pressed the tip of the nail to his chest with a smile.

""That is good? Oh, I'm so glad."" It was as though he was talking to someone, but no one was there except us, ""They're leaving. It's okay, you don't need to."" He paused, ""Alright.""

My younger brother gripped my head and pointed to the water which had begun to bubble. The swamp began to get darker even though I swore we had another hour of sunlight left. My skin began to crawl as the bubbling became more violent.

""I told you she'd be mad. You should leave. Go."" My father's voice became more frantic and urgent, though it still had an air of calm happiness. It was like he wanted to yell, but couldn't.

My younger brother started to cry as we stared at the bubbling water. A lone hand reached up from it's depths; a hand attached to an arm long enough to reach branches higher than I was tall.

""Run."" My father's oddly cheery voice again.

Another hand burst from the water, followed by another and another; Each of them grabbing branches. Whatever was down there was pulling itself out.

""Run.""

A low gurgling scream emitted from the water, growing in volume as I watched transfixed at the amount of hands that were sliding out from beneath the dark waters of Marsh Baywood Swamp. My younger brother was yanking on my hair; He wanted to run, but I couldn't I was transfixed.

""RUN!"" This time my fathers voice was different. It was urgent, it was frantic, and it was a yell. I immediately snapped out of my trance and turned to run. I could hear the thing behind me trying to give chase through the dense trees. I burst into the backyard and slammed the back door behind me. I put Brandon on the couch, grabbed up a kitchen knife, and opened the door to the backyard.

Nothing was there, aside from my fathers shoes neatly arranged near the door. My father was never found, and when I took the police back to where I had found my father the only thing we found were the shirts. The 16 that were there before, 12 new ones, and my fathers; hanging neatly by an iron nail.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1374560515.0,,,True,t3_1iv7yf,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iv7yf/the_marsh_baywood_shirts/,

Written by myself and my pal Chris.

PT Boomer.

When we were on holiday with family in Germany, we went to a small market where a man was selling bootleg VCR’s. One of the tapes was labelled ""Thomas Magic Railroad pre-cut"". We used our money to buy it and the seller didn't even bat an eye, he must not have known what it was. When we got back to the small Hotel we were staying at, our parents let us stay up in the main room and watch it, so we did. When the VHS started up, lots of writing came up on the screen, looked like a script. It was grey-scale and there was an eerie noise being emitted. After that, the movie started as normal, be it with some colour disfiguration.

Then the VHS got choppy, and various scenes and disfigured audio cut around the screen. It then booted back to greyscale, and P.T. Boomer standing beside Lady. The engine was crying, asking him to stop, but he opened up her engine compartment and began hitting it with a wrench, causing her to scream. She began begging and crying, and he shoved a cloth down her funnel. Black smoke filtered out her sides and she began wheezing and faintly screaming. Then a woman entered from the back. She looked at Boomer and shouted what sounded like ""you again!"" then an inaudible break, then ""I won’t let you take another"". Boomer looked at her, and then threw the wrench towards her. She dodged, but he then tackles her to the floor and says ""if not her, then who, you?” She screams at him and hits him, and the camera pans back to the Lady engine, as her face goes purple and her eyes roll back. The woman can be heard crying and screaming, and then suddenly there is a large thud, then silence. Boone then walks past the camera, dragging a body by the foot. The scene then cuts to Burnett sitting in church. He looks over to the other side, and sees P.T. Boomer standing there. Boomer then steps back into the shadows and disappears. 

After the scene faded to black the screen again became choppy and the movie seemingly returned to normal. We were both shocked at what we had just seen; everything about those few minutes completely contradicted the extremely light tone of the film's first few scenes. We both knew that complaining about it to our Parents would make us seem ungrateful and there was nothing else to do except counting the amount of Spiders under the bed. So we kept on watching... For the next ten or so minutes the film seemingly continued as normal. My younger sibling was a little scared of the evil Diesel engine although I quickly assure her that he couldn't hurt her. Suddenly the screen jumped around and we found ourselves watching a strikingly different scene. Burnett is standing at the foot of his beloved Wife’s empty grave. It's a dark, stormy night and he is completely alone, or so we thought... 

""I'm sorry Daisy...I'm so sorry. I failed you... I promised you that I'd protect you... I've never forgotten you. I've never even thought of seeing someone else. I'll never forget you."" Burnett looks down at his mud-stained shoes. A single tear falls. ""Still here Burnett?” Burnett looks up in shock, but there's no one there. Suddenly the second voice sounds through the left side of the room's crappy Television, ""Of course you are... You never left.” Burnett looked to his left, again no one was there. ""And neither did I"" then sounded through the Television's right side. Burnett did not look to his right though, with tears or both sadness and anger falling down his face he shouts, ""BOOMER!” Burnett turns around to see the ghostly figure of P.T. Boomer, a Man who hasn’t been seen in Shining Town for over 5 years. Burnett takes a swing but Boomer catches his hand and throws it back at him. Boomer starts to walk around Burnett “How’s Lady coming along? I bet you're fixing her up real good!” Burnett follows Boomer’s eyes. ""Yeah I bet she's looking real pretty now... I’d love to see her Burnett, where have you hidden her?"". “I’m gonna kill you!” screamed Burnett. Suddenly Boomer was in Burnett’s face, before he could act Boomer had him on the floor, he beat him, mercilessly. ""See you around"" chuckled Boomer. Burnett sat in a pool of his own blood. The scene once again, faded to black...

We sat there in shock, both in disbelief at what we had just seen. Heroically, I stood up and walked to the VCR. “Enough, no more.” I approached the machine and pressed the eject button. Nothing happened.  I tried again, but still nothing happened. “It’s not…it’s not working!” I looked at the screen which was just static at that moment. My Sister suggested that we try pulling out the power cable, which we did…but the Television remained on. We both stared at it, “Mom?” I called out. There was no answer. “Dad?!” There was no answer. I slowly edged back towards the bed and sat down. As soon as I made contact with the bed the film resumed. We held hands and prepared for the next scene.

“I don’t know how to explain it Doc…it’s like he was there…and wasn’t at the same time” the Psychiatrist stared into Burnett’s eyes, knowing that this was far beyond his capabilities. “Burnett, I won’t lie to you.  I’ve never had a client with this sort of issue before… Why don’t you tell me about this man…? Boomer did you say his name was?”. “Boomer, yeah that’s his name… Back in High School we didn’t exactly get along. I was popular, he wasn’t…you get the picture. He was always jealous of me, and I knew that I had what he most wanted, Daisy. After graduation neither of us left Shining Time so we saw a lot of each other. He was always pleasant, but I knew that he hated my guts. I’d often see him down at the local Mechanics, buying parts for his bike whilst I was acquiring tools for Lady.” There was a brief silence in which Burnett looked down at his hands. “Lady?” inquired the Psychiatrist. “Yeah Lady, my engine, she was a beauty. Man, I put so many hours into working on her...maybe too many. Boomer knew it. Daisy would often say that I paid more attention to Lady than I did to her, that I cared more about Lady than I did her.”,  “Did you?” Burnett considered this question; again he looked down at his hands, which were now quite sweaty. “Maybe… This one night, I decided to take a break from Lady and go out for a drink, Daisy didn’t come with me cus she had a headache – one of her many – I came home at 3AM, steaming drunk…barely made it through the door.  I assumed that Daisy was in bed, so I decided to check on Lady, you know just to see if she hadn’t been stolen or something. But what I saw was worse…” The Psychiatrist stared at Burnett, eyeing him up and down and taking note of his body language.

  “I think we can leave it there Mr –“, “She was destroyed! Completely busted! And then I noticed the blood stains…the scratch marks and the chunk of hair. I ran up the stairs to look for Daisy but she wasn’t there… SHE WAS FUCKING GONE!”  The Psychiatrist cut him off. “MR. STONE! I MUST INSIST THAT YOU STOP!-”, “NO DOC BECAUSE NOW WE’RE GETTING TO THE GOOD BIT! I KNEW RIGHT AWAY!  I… I knew that it was him, Boomer. I had no issues with anyone other than him. Only he could do something like this. And then… and then at the funeral he was there! But just for a second, just for a second I saw him. And here we are, back at square one. He appears at my Wife’s grave and beats the shit out of me! And apparently I’m the only fucking person in this fucking town that’s seen him! Explain that Doc!” Burnett sat down, realizing that in his anger he had positioned himself over the Psychiatrist. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to –“, “No Mr Stone, I understand. I’m going to give you this medication, I can’t guarantee anything but it’s worth trying.” Burnett hesitantly took the pills and faced the other Man, “Thanks Doc”. 

Despite taking the pills Burnett does not become any happier; he still sees Boomer around the town, on the other side of the street or at the back of an alley. However every time Burnett gets close, Boomer is gone. Burnett now lives life as a shut-in, as time goes on he sees less of Boomer until he’s finally alone. From this point onwards the film seems pretty normal; Thomas the Tank Engine does his thing, Mr Conductor and his Cousin get into mischief together and Diesel continues to scare my younger Sister. 

We occasionally check back in with Burnett who is visited by his grand-daughter, Lilly. The film nears its conclusion with a thrilling chase sequence involving Thomas, Lady and the dastardly Diesel. “Now I’ll get you, Burnett Stone!” teases Diesel. As he draws close to Lady, Burnett (who is in Lady’s cab) retorts: “No you won’t, because the magic you refuse to believe in, will get the better of you!” But then, Burnett looks back to confirm something… he looks at Diesel to see Boomer riding on top of Diesel! “Oh shit!” exclaims Burnett “Guess who’s back Burnett! It’s me…BOOMER!”  Boomer orders Diesel to attack Lady, the rusty claw scrapes Lady’s newly coated paint. “I’ve spent so long running from you, so long hiding. No more. You killed my Daisy, you destroyed my Lady. WHY?!” Boomer stared at Burnett in disbelief, “You still don’t understand? You mistreated Daisy! You spent so much time working on that stupid fucking engine! YOU DON’T DESERVE THEM! I DO! All of those years back in School! All of the times you and your stupid friends shoved me in a locker, or flushed my head down a toilet! And now you've got your engine working! You and your fucking granddaughter! Not for much longer, I’m going to take them both away from you! “Burnett knew that time was running short, he increased Lady’s speed whilst trying to avoid Diesel’s claw. Burnett looked up to see an un-stable bridge.

Boomer fell off the bridge, and missed the barge. He ended up under water. He began floundering and choking. Then, a light appeared. He swam towards it, and there was a flash. Boomer was then standing in a large white space. And a woman in black appeared in front of him. She gave him a cold stare, it was Daisy, the Woman he had always wanted. Boomer tried to run, but immediately ropes appeared around him. The screen flickered and cut to a new scene. A large factory could be seen, and boomers screams were heard along with various other machinations. Then, a door opened, and a train rolled out. Boomer had been transformed into one of them. He screamed and cried, as his engine burst and he was engulfed in flames. The screen jittered, and he was human again. He was disfigured, scarred. He cries.

Suddenly with a flicker we’re back to Thomas, Lady, Burnett and his granddaughter, Lilly. As well as Mr Conductor and his Cousin. Still shocked from what we’ve just seen, we’re both thankful to be back in the warm light of the Island of Sodor. Burnett and Mr Conductor are able to create more Gold dust saving both Sodor and Shining Time Station. The day is saved! But something just doesn't feel right… by this point I’ve realized not to let my guard down. I felt as if we were about to get another surprise, and that’s exactly what happened…

 The film cut, to see Boomer enter a plastic surgeon’s office. In it, he goes under, and a voice is heard ""Here is what you have always wanted Boomer. She is yours now. You shall never forget her"". Boomer awakens from surgery; his face is engulfed in shadows, so we cannot see him. Then, he stands up. His memory is uneven, he can’t remember his name. We still can’t see his face. The film cuts to ten years later. Boomer is walking home, it’s quite late and he’s had a bit too much to drink. He enters his home to find the house empty, his wife is missing. He sees a shadowy figure, standing still. ""What did you do to my wife!?"" He screams. He looks down, but the figure is gone. He then cries over his loss. Finally, his face looks up. We see who he is. He is Burnett. Burnett passes out and awakens face to face with Boomer. A woman’s voice is heard ""he will make the mistakes you made. If you seek redemption, you must slay your inner demon"". Burnett then wakes up in the ditch with his dead wife, he remembers everything. He remembers being Boomer. And so he opens the door to the shack to find lady. Then the screen cuts away. Shortly after, the film cuts to another Boomer scene, as his therapist tells him he's going insane, after he relays the events. He is given pills. He takes them.

In the final scene, Burnett kneels at this Wife’s empty grave, and says ""It's dead. I killed it. I redeemed myself"". Then a high pitched wailing is heard, Burnett turns to see bright lights. It is revealed to be a Train. As it comes towards him, he turns to look at the camera, and says ""some demons just won’t stay dead"". The VCR the cut off as it caught fire. We left the Hotel the next day, only to find out the next day via some travelers, that the Hotel was completely destroyed. A rail-line on the ridge above was damaged in the night, and a train collapsed off the tracks, and hit the Hotel...

Downtown was a great place to live because it would limit my driving to going to work and coming home. Anything else I needed or wanted was no more than a 15 minute walk in any direction really. 

I was new to the city. I had visited before when I was serving on another ship, so I was familiar with the area, but this was the first time I'd lived here. Lucky for me a good friend from work had agreed to be my roommate and he was pretty familiar with the area.

The building we decided to move into was brand new. We'd later find out that this was a horrible decision because new buildings are bought and sold rather quickly and rent rates fluctuate as a result. Nevertheless, we were excited to have our own place, a nice condo downtown where we could walk in any direction and do what we wanted.

I'm not someone who subscribes to religious ideas or any sort of hokey pokey stuff, so when my sister called me and said I needed to do her a favor and give her friend a place to stay while she got back on her feet, I was eager to help, but worried that her friend would try to push a lot of religion. I knew her parents and they were Jehovah Witnesses. As it turns out this girl was more into Feng Shui and preventing demons and evil spirits from accosting a home. 

So I give her the couch and the next day it's business as usual. I drive to work, and drive home. I come home to find bells and goldfishes and furniture moved around. This of course leads me to ask her why she did all this to which she replies, ""Oh, bells on your cabinets make noise to repel malicious spirits, and the goldfishes are for good luck, and the furniture is arranged for a better flow of energy. 

In my head I'm rolling my eyes. I don't believe any of this stuff, and what happened later, I'm still skeptical of whether or not it's even related.

About a week goes by and I start hearing noises. Now... I'm not one of those people who likes horror movies. The stories are entertaining, but I'm not a fan of being surprised by loud noises that seem to come from out of nowhere accompanied by sudden creepy images. Just not my bag of tea. I do, however, like to think about things rationally. 

So in my mind every noise had a good reason. Mind you, I'm talking about late at night or during the day when I'm along in the place. I chalk one noise up to being the dishes not being put away correctly so they settled. Dull creeks of what sounded like cabinets and doors MUST be this girl getting up in the middle of the night to get something... little things like that. 

I come home early from work one day to find this girl sitting on the couch looking concerned. I ask what's wrong and she says, ""The faucet in the kitchen. It turned on by itself and then turned off."" I said that was improbable, but went to check the sink to see if it was broken. Seemed fine. I was tired and it was only about noon, so I decided to take a nap as this girl decides she is going to leave and run some errands. 

I hadn't purchased a real bed yet so I was sleeping on a queen sized air mattress. I got nice and comfortable... and then something that had NEVER happened to me before, EVER... I mean, I've had nightmares as a kid, but not as an adult... this didn't seem to be a nightmare. 

I was falling asleep... and suddenly, just as you enter that between state of being conscious and going to sleep... I felt a finger hook into my right cheek and pull back... this feeling was as real as if I would have hooked my own cheek with my own right index finger... and as I felt it, I woke up, but just before... in that split second before you fully enter consciousness, I heard as clear as day the voice of a child that I could not make out to be male or female...""I seee youuuu...."" and as I entered full consciousness I felt paralyzed, completely incapable of moving. I was tense throughout my entire body and my arms were bent at the elbow and my fists under my chin. I found it very difficult to move and it took me a while to regain my full range of motor skills. It was as if I had been wearing a lead suit for a few seconds. 

A week later, my roommate and I were home and the girl was out for the day hunting for apartments. My roommate and I were playing an online game he had just introduced me to and I was figuring out the details. Now... I know that these things can happen without warning and that not everyone can see the signs and that some people may not display obvious signs prior to any occurrence... but this was still a chilling experience.

My friend knocks on my door and asks to come in. He looks grim, down and completely depressed and says he needs to talk. This was odd to me because at work, though we complained about our jobs quite frequently because of the current circumstances, I never really thought it was bad enough to come to this. With a sad face he looks at me and says, ""I've been sitting in my room for the past hour with the door locked, and all of my medications spread out over my desk... and I've just been wondering how much and at what regularity over the next couple of hours I should take all of them to prevent vomiting, but not wake up.""

I took him to the hospital and after he was admitted, I came home to an empty and dark apartment at about 3 in the morning. I had about three hours of sleep that I could get before having to get ready for work. I laid down and fell asleep. My alarm went off as scheduled and the noise brought me out of unconsciousness... but at that same moment between states, I felt one palm facing down pulling on my forehead and a finger hooking my cheek again. As soon as I heard that voice shout, ""NO!"", I forced myself up and out of bed. I felt heavy and tired.


Now, again, these are not things I normally purport to be true or have any knowledge of... what I can say, is that once my sister's friend left and took her bells and goldfishes with her, it stopped. The place seemed more well lit, less 'heavy', and the ambiance was much more comfortable. I'm not sure what this girl carried in with her, but I'm glad it left with her as well.

You look up to the moon one night. You look into its craters and mountains, a cruel face forming in your head.

It's simple pareidolia. 

The trees scratch against your window, their shadow making a cruel, demonic face on your wall, its eyes and mouth moving erratically. 

It's simple pareidolia. 

You go downstairs for a drink. You hear a thump as something falls, sounding like a heavy footstep. Simply a book in the kitchen.

It's simple pareidolia.

You go back to your room and leave the door open to air the room out. Shivers fly up your spine at the sound of the door hinges and their creaks, reminding you of a bloodcurdling scream.

It's simple pareidolia.

You cover yourself with the blanket and attempt to fall asleep. The hinges creak once more. You lift your head and come to the conclusion it was the wind... No one was there.

But wait... Wind from the window wouldn't have been closing the door. The shadow of the tree stretched on to your bedroom door. This part of its shadow seemed... separate from the rest. A dark, thin body spread across it, tall, its eyes menacing, looking down at you. Its smile, large and wide, black spots of blood on the seemingly white teeth... A knife in its hand, you observe. 

It was just a shadow, right?
Is it simple pareidolia?

You wish.

It's round gold handle gave off a slight glimmer. Most likely from reflecting the light from the dim lamp. It'd always flicker. In order for the flickering to stop, I'd have to tap it but as usaul it would start back up about 5 minutes later. Looking back at my closet, I noticed it was slightly open. It would always have a crack in it because for some odd reason it never closed completely. But this time it was more open than usual. ""Eh, probably just my dad forgetting to close it all the way after getting some tools."" I told myself. I had to tell myself that to make me feel secure. My tired self put an effort into getting out of bed and closing the closet to the point where it wouldn't close anymore. I pulled the blankets over my head and went to sleep. 
The next morning I awoke and looked over at my closet. Same as I left it. I reached over and turned off my lamp since the sun rays were seeping through my window. I have always loved natural light. Only when the night time would come did I ever settle for artificial light. I went on with my usual day. Nothing strange. Nothing weird. Until that damn night. It was around 10ish and I figured I might as well go to sleep. I crawled into bed and turned on my lamp. The flickering from my lamp was more frequent than usual. Thinking nothing of it, i fell asleep. 
There was suddenly a very cool breeze that passed over me. Cold enough to wake me. Wondering why it was so cold, I went to check the thermometer. 76 degrees it read. It felt normal in the hallway and when I went back into my room, it felt the same way as the hall. ""Maybe I just left my window open from earlier."" Walking over to my window it didn't take me less than a second to realize my window was closed. I was stumped. I mean, my fan wasn't on and neither was the air conditioner. I glanced at my closet. Open. Not all the way, but not closed. I peered in. When I looked up I noticed the string that turned on the light bulb was swinging. Slowly. Steadily. Solemnly. But swinging. Nothing was there; nothing I could see, anways. By this time you know i was freaked the fuck out but I couldn't do anything about it. My dad would never believe me and my brother would just think I'm being stupid so I just closed it back, tapped my lamp, and went to sleep. The next morning i opened my eyes and turned my attention towards my closet. ""damn."" i thought to myself. I couldn't tell if it was just a bad dream or a reality. Then I looked over at my bedroom door. Closed. This was strange. I would never leave my door closed for the fear of a robber or a psycho-mass-murderer. You know, if I needed to get out I could get out fast instead of having to jiggle the handle to finally be freed.
I went on with my day. There wasn't much to do, it was still winter and even if I did want to go out I'd have to come home within a three hour span because the sun would go down so fast. So, as usual, I stayed inside. 
As most teens would be, I was still very curious about my closet. After my T.V. show ended I went into my room and started tip toeing to my closet. A low, horrific grumble came from it. I slammed it shut. At this point I was in such fear that tears were brought to my eyes but no sound would come out of my mouth. I didn't know what to do. Maybe I had just imagined it? No. It was too realistic. Too realistic to be forgotten. Too realistic to be fake. I ran back into the living room and started to watch more T.V. to get that horrific sound out of my head. The very thought of falling asleep made me cringe, for that if i woke up, I'd see bright, blood-looking eyes staring right back at me. Thinking of it sent chills up my spine and twisted my stomach into knots. Darkness crept through the living room windows as night time was approaching. Shut them. Shut all the blinds. I didn't want to think of it as night time because as i said before, I don't like artificial light. Maybe it was because I knew that natural light would always come back. Or maybe it was because I knew artificial light could leave me to be alone in the dark. Either one I had no control over. Being exhausted over doing nothing, I decided to go lay down. My dad had still not gotten off of work and I had no idea of when he was going to be home. I wasn't too worried about it. He usually worked late anyways. I reached up into bed, turned on my shitty lamp, and closed my eyes. 
I woke up drenched in sweat. It was still night time. Great. I rubbed my eyes to get my vision back. Looking at my door I could tell it was shut. Examining it more I could tell it was locked. ""DAD?"" I scram through the house. No answer. I quickly got up, not even thinking for a second to look at my closet. As I got closer to the door i tried to twist the lock. It wouldn't budge. ""What th-"" I heard it again. The same low grumble; but louder. I froze completely still. Slowly turning, I saw my closet door completely open. Too scared to scream, I just walked towards it. Worst decision of my life. 
It grabbed me. Whatever it was, I was still unsure of. I let out a high pitched squeak. It didn't like that. It started to wrap its, what had felt like arms, around my waist. Tighter and tighter with every sound I would make. The flickering form my lamp started blinking, and then it stopped. Complete darkness. That made me scream. It pulled me closer towards the closet. Trying to get away, I just started to claw at my abdomen. The pain was excruciating. I broke skin. Silent tears roleed down my face but as soon as i felt the blood starting to collect under my finger nails, I went insane. I didn't even care anymore. I just started screaming. Tearing away flesh from my stomach with each swipe of my hand trying to escape from that hell. Suddenly it stopped. One last low grumble from the thing started to drift away until it was completely gone. The arms let loose. I dropped to the floor gasping for air. Holding my stomach with one arm, i crawled to the bathroom with the other to see the damage i had done to myself.

That is what she said to me. That is what she said as she placed the blue things into my hand and smiled. I said nothing, because at the time, I didn’t know what to say. Now, I know I was right not to say anything, because there could be no words to describe or relate what was about to happen to me. I said nothing at all. I just walked away, out of the meadow I found her in, out of the woods I’d wandered through to get there. I didn’t look back. I just assumed she crawled back into the soft soil hole where she lived. I briefly imagined her becoming wrapped in living roots and ensnared beneath the earth, periodically running her black, twig-like fingers through her pitch and oily hair. I imagined her falling back to sleep; dormant for another eon.


When I got home, everything had changed. I was alone; most of the elegant furnishings of the house had fallen into disrepair or had gone missing, as though my world had shifted toward another dimension but had gotten caught halfway there. The sun was visible through my window, but it was suspended lifelessly, and emitted a dry, purplish light that cast the room in an uncomfortable glow. There was no way to tell what time of day it was- or for how long the sun had been stuck there in the empty sky.


Everything was still.


Still.


So still that a whisper would fall, clattering to the ground before anyone could hear it. No one was around. There was nothing but stillness.


My body was cold. My limbs were marble slabs that scraped and thudded loudly across the linoleum floor as I drifted aimlessly around the house, looking for something I could not recall. I was like a ghost, softly seeking someone to complain to. All the food in the refrigerator had melted or rotted, but even if it was edible it would be of no use to me. I was busy chewing on broken bits of the clock that had died some time ago, whose pieces were strewn about my bedroom. The pieces had small oxygen bubbles in them, which assisted me in breathing as I waded slowly through the hallway. This hall was completely filled with water and had smiling fish floating in it. The fish were unmoving, unblinking, but stacked so well together into complex geometric shapes.


While observing their stacks, I had forgotten to continue chewing, and therefore ran out of air. As I struggled to escape the hallway, one of the many hundred doors on either side creaked open, and all of the water rushed out, draining the shapes and I into a featureless void of black.


Everything was still.


Nothing was still.


The abyss.


I worried that I had ceased to exist, and concerned myself that this was a permanent state. I felt a drop of blood trickle from my neck and down my spine, so I reached my left hand back to touch it. In doing so, I realized that my finger had been in my ear, and now that it was removed, I could hear a little. I could hear blood dripping all around me. I touched my back and felt the blood, then removed my right finger from my right ear. Now I could hear well. Blood was splattering and sloshing all around me. I breathed heavily and rapidly, frightened that I could not see what I was hearing.


With both hands free, I could rub my eyes. When I did so, I saw tiny slivers of pale light. I realized that my eyes were closed, which had cloaked me in darkness. After a brief pause-


-I opened them.


I was not in my house, nor in the void- I was in the woods, at the bottom of a steep gulley. It was not blood that splashed all around me, but rain. And the rain made mud. Lots of mud. I floundered and struggled there in the pit, trying desperately to escape it, but the slick mud acted as my prison. I looked up and witnessed the awesome storm clouds which darkened the world and pitilessly drenched me. I cried out and reached up for branches, which cut my hands and arms. This time, I bled.


If I couldn’t get out, I’d drown in the rainwater. I feared for my life, and I had no more clock bits to chew. So I resolved to live. If I could not escape by climbing out, I would escape by digging in. I used my hands, which now looked more like black claws, to strip mud and earth away from the ground. My jet and oily hair clung to my face and blinded me. I didn’t care. I was going to live.


I tunneled for hours. I burrowed like a sightless mole through the earth.


Finally, I erupted from my soil prison. I saw the bright sunny sky, and heard the birds chirping cheerfully. I felt the breeze coming through the hills and down into the meadow in which I stood. A boy was waiting for me there.


I looked at him, and paused for a moment- then reached my hand out, and gave to him a few blue things.
“These little ones are baby universes,” I said.


He said nothing, and walked away. He walked out of the meadow he found me in, out of the woods he’d wandered through to get here. I climbed back into my soil hole, ran my fingers through my hair, and fell asleep amidst the strangling hug of the cool, wet roots.

“Are you our new neighbor?” She asked, her voice laced with curiosity.

“I would suppose so,” I answered, trying to sound as polite as possible.

“What’s your name?” She asked, after a brief pause.

“Um, Robin. Robin Baker. What’s your name?”

“Ummm…” She sounded generally confused.

“Can’t remember your own name? That’s interesting.” I said this trying to convey a feeling of humor and good heartedness.

“Yes, I can! I’m Cynthia! Cynthia Tyler!” She said this with sheer frustration.

“That’s a pretty name. Nice to meet you Cynthia.”

“Nice to meet you too.” 

“What are you playing with?”

“These are my dolls.”

“Those are some nice dolls there. Do they have names?:

“Um, this one is named Gretchen, her name is Jacqueline,” she paused for a moment, “and her name is Carol, and his name is… um … Jack. I hadn’t named this one yet, but I think I am gonna call it Robin. Like you.”

I laughed. “Wow, those are all good names! My mother’s actually named Carol.”

“Hmm,” she thought for a minute. “Do you like your mother?” She asked, the whole tone of her voice taking a swift turn from a perky to a macabre undertone. 

“Of course, I do! I love my mother!” I was a bit taken aback by the question.

“I don’t. I hate mine.”

“Don’t say that. Of course you don’t.”

“I do! I really do!” She stood up. “I hate her!” 

“Why would you say such a thing?”

“She’s such a… such a… She’s a bitch!”

I was shocked at the language. “Where did you learn to speak like that?” 

“My mother!”

I felt like there was a serious problem here. I naturally switched to psychologist mode. “Now why would you say that about her?”

“Ever since my dad died, she’s been so mad. All she does is yell at me. I wish she would’ve died instead.”

Her dad died. This was definitely in my job description. Me to the rescue. “Now don’t say that. Your mother loves you just as much as your dad, I’m sure.”

“You don’t know my mom.” She said, with a tone so upset and a single tear rolling down her face. “I have to go inside now.”

Neither said goodbye to one another.

Fast forward to my first day at my new job as a psychologist. I hadn’t seen much of Cynthia since our meeting, but I knew she would be going to this school, and with the events of the conversation in mind, I knew I could be seeing her in my office (I got an office!). Let me be the first to say that this school was no Harvard. The walls were a peeling turquoise green, and the coffee stained tile floors were missing about a tile a row. There was various debris all over the ground, and the walls had distinct stains of mustard, horse radish, marker, and blood. I feel bad for the principal. I met him first thing, before I did anything else in that school. He is a big fellow, who I learned wore the same flannel shirt and pants combo every day. He was not a man to wear a tie. I feel bad though because he obviously cares about the school and the students. “We are the forgotten school,” he has said time and time again. While meant as a joke, there was a reality in this. This school gets granted almost no money, ever. All the other schools in the district do, but the government either really did forget us or they just didn’t care. I would honestly have to lean towards the latter. I do really admire Mr. Miley (the principal) though. Although he works at a school turned to shit by vandals and unruly students, he’s always positive and he always gives a friendly “good morning” to everyone he passes, even the known troublemakers who he has problems with time and time again. On the first day, he showed me around the school, I met the different teachers, and then he showed me to my office. 
It really took no time at all after I settled in my office for a student to come in for examination. It was a neat little place. The walls were painted with blue, and on the floor was a nice, big rug with various patterns and designs on it. On one side of the room was my desk, and on the other side was a comforter, which is where the kids sit during our interviews. Anyways, this first person to come in was a little 8 year old girl in the first grade, just like Cynthia. I already felt bad for the girl when she walked in. She was not a film star beauty, and it looked as if there was not hope for her unless she went under the needle. She had curly red hair, with a face so freckled it looked like her natural face color. She was a chubby little thing, and her cheeks stuck out far enough to look like she was intentionally doing this. Her name was Gretchen. The name Gretchen was oddly familiar, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. She was in here for verbally and physically attacking another girl, which I thought was more the job that a principle or counselor should handle, not a psychologist. I interviewed her anyway. This was my one and only interaction with her, as she will be moving a week from that day. 

“Hello,” I said in my most calming voice.

The girl was looking away, silent.

“How are you today?” I asked.

Silence.

“Do you wanna talk?” 

Gretchen shook her head no.

“Why not?”

“Well I…” she began, but realizing what she had done, she quickly covered her mouth.

I laughed. “I almost had you there for a second, didn’t I?”

The girl flashed a little grin, but she still wouldn’t speak to me. 

“Well, I got you smiling. That’s something.”

The girl continued her smile. 

“Well, I normally give out prizes to the people that talk. You wouldn’t be interested in that though, would you?”

That caught her attention.

“Unless, maybe you would enjoy this Hershey bar I got in my desk…” I wanted that Hershey bar. But my job was more important. 

“I’ll talk! Gimme!” She suddenly yelled.

“No, not yet. You gotta answer some questions first!”

She looked disappointed. “What kind of questions?”

“I just need to ask you a few questions about yourself, ok?”

She pondered this for a moment, until she finally said “Ok.”

“So why are you here today?”

“I got into a fight.” She answered almost immediately.

“I don‘t normally deal with people just because they‘ve gotten into a fight. Are you sure that’s the only reason?”

She looked confused. “What do you mean that’s not what you deal with?”

I stumbled around looking for an answer that won’t offend her. “I normally deal with… other things. Nevermind that.” Smooth, Robin.

“I already saw Mrs. Irwin…” Uh oh. Mrs. Irwin was the school counselor. That most likely means she igot stuck in here for something else.

“What did she say?” I asked.

“That I needed to see you!”

“Ok. Ok. Let’s talk about your fight. Can you tell me about it?”

She waited before she answered. “She called me ugly,” she finally spit out.

“And what did you do about that?”

“I told her to leave me alone.”

I believed that was an appropriate answer. “That was an appropriate answer. Then what happened?”

“I attacked her with scissors,” she said with a certain playfulness that was really disturbing to me. 

“And why did you do that?”

“She called me ugly, stupid!”

Although I was actually kind of offended, I let it slide. “Then what did you do?”

“I got her. Right in the back. She’s in the hospital now.”

“Who did you get into a fight with?”

“Cynthia Tyler.”

Cynthia! The little girl I met! The poor devil was in the hospital because of a scissor wound to the back! That was the climax of the conversation. A few weeks later, Gretchen got shipped off to God knows where after some interviewing with someone who wasn’t me (I never told you, I’m not actually very good) and I never truly saw her again. 

A boring two weeks went by. It wasn’t till the end of those two weeks where my first incident happened, the first in a long line of many. I arrived home from work after a tedious day of doing nothing and looking at YouTube videos. I walked in the door of my apartment building, and I immediately noticed that something was off. The building had a different… atmosphere. It was differently lighted and something was changed about the… sound. It was the kind of deathly quiet where you truly could hear a pin drop. “Hello?” I shouted, trying to make sure I wasn’t the only one here. There was no response. I proceeded cautiously up the stairs, and with each step I began to hear more and more. At first, all I could hear was the faint whisper of… something. Somebody, some creature, I couldn’t tell. As I continued, I began to hear that it was a little girl’s voice… singing. I couldn’t hear the words at first, but I could distinctly tell that the tune of the song was to “Ring Around the Rosy,” which was always creepy if you did it just right. I slowly began walking up more stairs. I started to begin to make out the words. 

*Gretchen…. School again…. Don’t like her…*

The rest was inaudible. I very slowly walked up a few more steps, and I could finally make out the entire song. I was horrified.

*Gretchen, Gretchen, never went to school again
If she‘s gone, they won’t care, they don’t even like her there*

I wanted to walk out, but I couldn’t. My curiosity was too overwhelming.

*Gretchen, Gretchen, never went to school again
If she’s gone, they won’t care, they don’t even like her there*

My heart was pounding and my face was turning red as I went farther up.

*Gretchen, Gretchen, never went to school again
If she’s gone, they won’t care, they don’t even like her there*

This was it. I was nearly there just … a few more… steps….

*Gretchen, Gretchen, never went to school again
If she’s gone, they won’t care, they don’t even like her there*

1360469519.0,13,self.creepypasta,188bsu,Peaches,Jdigital1983,19,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/188bsu/peaches/,"One of my favorite memories of my father is helping him steal peaches. 

The peach industry in Chilton County harvests thousands upon thousands of peaches each year. I suppose he figured they wouldn’t miss a basket or two.

Eventually, stealing peaches in the early hours of the morning became something my father and I would do together. I’m not sure why he decided to go so early, maybe because less people were out and about. Before long, my uncle and cousin started to join us. My cousin and I would wait sleepily on a blanket in the back of the truck’s camper while my father and uncle picked out a few buckets. 

One such morning in late June, my father shook me awake and packed me in the truck. It was still dark as we drove the few minutes it took to meet my uncle at his home in Clanton. My uncle climbed in the cab and my cousin and I sluggishly moved into the camper. I could faintly hear a few grunts and mutters from my father and uncle in the cab. A Marty Robbins song hummed its way out of the static. I felt a jolt as the truck popped into gear and we rumbled down the road towards the farm.

Soon enough, the smooth asphalt gave way to the bumpy dirt road. The dirt and rocks crackled gently against the tires as I drifted gently in and out of sleep, waking up every so often as we hit a dip in the road. The truck rumbled to a stop as we reached our destination and I heard the doors to cab open as my father and uncle went in search of peaches.

I must have drifted off to sleep after that. I just remember waking up in the middle of my father shouting from some distance away. After waking up fully, I thought I could hear a faint, wet, rattling sort of noise. It was so low I couldn’t tell if I was hearing it or just imagining it. My young mind thought it sounded like someone was at the bottom of a glass of chocolate milk and was sucking the hell out of it with a straw. Both my father’s shouting and the noise grew closer. My cousin was somehow still asleep.

I rubbed my eyes and peeked out the side window of the camper. I saw my father running towards the truck with a bucket of peaches, no sign of my uncle. In a few strides, he cleared about fifteen feet and slammed into the cab of the truck, cranking up the engine. He was still shouting, his fear had made his voice ragged. As he turned the truck around in the dirt road, I saw what he had been running from.

The early morning light illuminated the Thing’s gigantic head as it glided gently above the peach trees. I could not tell if it was that tall or if it was flying but it’s head didn’t dip and rise with the motion of walking. Its face was gnarled and badly wrinkled. The skin was the warm gray of a river bed and its mouth was screwed up into a rictus grin with tiny nubs of teeth darting through. It caught the sight of the truck with its small, dark stare and turned to face it. As it did, the mouth of the thing opened slightly and the sucking sound began again, more intensely.

By that time, my father had gotten the truck turned around and hit the gas. It took the tire a moment to gain traction on the red Alabama dirt but when it did, the truck lurched forward, knocking me over onto my cousin.

I don’t remember much else until my father stopped the truck. We were on the shoulder of the asphalt road, miles from the farm. My cousin was sobbing and asking for his father. He looked at me through tears and convulsing with sobs, covered up to his chin in the old blanket. I couldn't find my words. He hadn't seen the Thing, he wouldn't understand what happened and I had no way to explain it.

I heard the cab door open and I saw my father walk past with the bucket of peaches. He threw them in the woods with a yell and walked quickly back to the truck. There was a short pause before he climbed back in the cab and slammed the door. The truck's engine roared to life and we drove home quietly into the pinkish violet hue of the rising sun.

The truck sputtered out the last of it's temporary life in the plain concrete driveway of our home. My cousin and I, frightened, stayed quiet in the back of the camper, hoping at some moment this would all be awful prank. My uncle popping out of the bushes and yelling, “Gotcha!” while gut-laughing at our youthful gullibility. 

In my heart I knew differently. The quality unique to children that allows them to be bright-eyed and hopeful in this fucked up world had been snuffed out when that damned Thing got a hold of my uncle.

My father shakily opened the rear of the camper and looked at us. The morning light shone around him making a ragged silhouette from the man. 

He looked towards me and muttered, “Did you see it?”

I gulped down the stone and my throat and nodded. He hung his head. 

“Where is my daddy?”

My cousin was out of the blanket now, his tearful eyes searched for an answer from my father but he had none to give. My father's body tremored slightly, he shook his head and walked away.

My uncle was reported as a missing person. There were search teams, there were dogs and even the local news station became interested after a while. Of course, they found nothing and after several weeks the official searches were called off. In a few months, everyone besides my father, my cousin and my aunt went on with their lives. My aunt still got a few do-gooders from church to search the fields of the county every now and then but as my father and I knew, it was all in vain. My uncle or his body would never be found. The Thing had digested him along with the peaches or had done something much worse.  I find it better not to think about it.

I watched the toll it took on my father through the years. He didn't turn to drink or drugs, he didn't do much at all after that. The Thing had sucked the joy of living from him. He committed suicide when I was eighteen but I didn't find it sad. I understood. He just couldn't bear the burden of this kind of a world any longer. Sometimes, I wish I had it in me to follow in his footsteps.

My cousin did the best he could for a boy that went through losing his father and is finishing up a business degree in Tuscaloosa. He came out of it the best of us. He hadn't seen the Thing that morning.

As for me, I had to get all this written down. I had to tell the story before I go in case, God forbid,  I don't make it back. I can't live in the same world as that thing. I have to kill it or die trying. For my father. For the man shaped hole it left in my cousin's life. For myself.

I have no idea how to kill it but I know where it lives. People disappear around this town all the time. 

I may not finish it off but I'll make damn sure it remembers me. 

Watch the papers.

I have always loved that time of the year, the shifting  of moods from death and ghosts to giving thanks to love and prosperity. However; my adoration for the season of change would ironically alter dramatically after visiting my good friend at penn state to watch a football game. I was driving from new york city, and was making the 7-ish hour trip solo, accompanied by no more than pandora radio. My car, a 2004 Toyota corolla, had seen better days by now and I was a little hesitant regarding my capabilities of making it there and back. Regardless, I wanted to go, and with my aspirations to trek out to Colorado and eventually the west coast, I needed to become more accustom to long drives by my lonesome. I hit the roads early Friday  morning, with some school stuff I was hoping, but realistically not expecting, to get done before the game, as well as some snacks and whatnot. The drive over was easy, not a lot of traffic, though I must note that Pennsylvania roads make little logical sense and wind around the entire godforsaken state. Anyways, in good time I arrived at my destination, unscathed and with the car still operational. The visit itself was enjoyable and for all intensive purposes, very normal. The game ended midday Saturday and I told my friend that, unfortunately, I couldn't drink that day or night because I needed to head back to the city for work, yes on Sunday morning. So after goodbyes I hopped in the Toyota and headed back on the good winding route 80. About an hour in, around 7pm, it was already dark and I was sleepy from the night before, it was one of those evenings where the world seems to end with your high-beams, and every passing second escalates your sense of unease. Despite the conditions, I continued on, more determined to get home in a timely manner than nervous of my ability to do so. I had just passed an exit for tannersvill and was nearing exit 302, riding the left most land, when I noticed something in the fog up ahead to the left. On the other side of the highway, surprisingly visible considering the weather, was what appeared to be an old beat up station wagon. As the vehicle came nearer, I realized that there were two shadows standing next to it, an unlucky couple stuck in the night. I passed them without much initial thought, but as I got closer to exit 302a I began to think of my father, who had passed away only a month ago. He used to always say that it was crucial, as a human being with a moral obligation, to lend a helping hand to those who need it. Feeling a bit emotional after thinking about my father, and realizing that it was currently around twenty degrees outside, I took the exit and got on the west bound side of route 80 heading back for the couple. It only took about 5 minutes before the station wagon came back into site, still almost quarter mile away, seemingly unaffected by the fog. I slowed up on the shoulder and rolled down my window, the man approached me, mid to late 20's with some manicured scruff and clear blue eyes.

""You folks need some help?"" I asked

The man greeted me with a wave and a grin. ""Hey fella, I really appreciate you stopping, we've found ourselves in a bit of a situation, deer came out the mist,  blew out a tire while dodging it, we don't have the spare anymore neither.""

""If you need a lift somewhere, I'm heading east and wouldn't mind bringing you."" 

He looked back to his, what I assumed was, wife. It occurred to me that she hasn't acknowledged me at all yet, but it was cold and I'd imagine she wasn't in the best of moods, so I just gave her a sincere smile and a half wave. She stared at her husband for a moment and nodded.

""Well that would be just great, thanks you friend!"" He seemed genuinely relieved as he opened the back for his wife and hopped in the front seat.
""We're just a couple minutes off of 302b, shouldn't be too out of your way."" 

""Not a problem, don't want you to freezing to death,"" I gave out a manic sounding laugh that even caught myself by surprise, I immediately felt awkward about the fact that they may be second guessing their choice to get in a car with me, ""uh, sorry about that"" I said as we pulled back onto the highway towards the opposing exit. 

It did only take a few minutes to hook around and get to 302b, the whole while Jeff and myself got along fine with small talk about the game that day and what penn state was like now as a post Sandusky program. I found Jeff really friendly, a great guy to talk to, he said he had a son, and that he just wanted to see him grow up and have a life for himself. He seemed a little sad at the thought, but I had no intentions to pry into the life of a complete stranger. All the while, his wife remained in the back, she said a few soft spoken words, but remained mostly silent. I had noticed that she was carrying a decorated box with her, of medium size resting upon her lap. She was constantly running her hands along it, with a look of yearning present in her eyes. Again, I had no desire to dig any deeper. 
We pulled onto bartonsvill wood road, and after about 300 yards we passed the end of a driveway.

""This is fine man, our driveway is a pain to drive out of and you've done plenty already, we'll walk down to our house. I really can't thank you enough for the kind favor."" Jeff got out of the car, opened the back door for his wife, and turned back to me, leaning his head through the door. 

""I really don't mind driving you down, it seems very dark down there,"" I offered.

He just chuckled and shook his head, ""don't worry about it, you're a good guy"" he gave me a handshake, and turned away with his wife, disappearing slowly into the blackness of the drive. What remained in my hand was a 20 dollar bill, which was awesome, a great gesture that would go towards gas money. I stashed the bill in the console compartment where I keep my change.
I got back on to route 80-e, feeling pretty please with my good deed. About 20 minutes after all those good feelings drained from me, the school work that I brought, and didn't even begin, I had left at my friends apartment, frantically, I pulled an illegal u turn through the medium and called my friend, hammering my shit-box Toyota to its max. It took me under an hour to get back to happy valley, going about 105 the whole time. I told my friend about my good deed and grabbed my book bag. He called me an idiot for picking up a ""bunch of hitch hiking loonies"", but I ensured him it was a fulfilling experience. At about 10:00, I was finally back on the road headed east. As I passed tannersvill, I though about how desolate the roads were at this time, and how that couple would have been forced to walk a few mile home in the black of night without a Good Samaritan, me, helping them out.
As I began to approach exit 302, I began to see their old station wagon on the grass past the shoulder on the opposing stretch of road, again appearing to cut through the fog. As I came closer, cold grabbed me and pushed all the air out of my lungs, my heart skipped and hammered in my chest and all the hair on my body rose with a tingled jolt of pure horror. Two figures, standing there at the car, looking down the road, needing help. Jeff and his wife, standing in the exact same spot, like nothing had happened, the wife still holding the decorated box. I just looked, in disbelief, in a state of paralysis, with no answers, and no grasp of what I was seeing before me. I instinctively pushed my foot into the floor, accelerating into the open road and chocking on fear . Cutting trough the black and fog without looking back, praying my car would bring me to safety. 
Thankfully it did, and I got home still shaken through, wanting nothing but to sleep and try to shake the memory, to not ask myself any questions of what I just experienced. 
I couldn't let it go, after about two hours of sleeplessness I called my friend and told him the story. He was pretty hammered and, like any normal person is expected to, thought I was just messing and trying to get a good scare. I honestly begged him to ask around about it. 
The next morning, I woke up with a missed call from him, I gave him a ring back, he sounded a little shaken. He explained that the only thing he has found was an article published in a local paper two weeks ago about a young couple and their 4 year old boy who were in a car accident right before exit 302. However; there was controversy over the accident due to the mothers mental stability and the fact that she had been driving the vehicle. All three died, there names were Jeff and Amy Hendrickson, with their son Thomas.
To this day I can't get everything straight in my head. All I know is that I never found the 20 dollar bill in my console compartment that morning, and I also really wish I knew what was in that fucking box.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_171e2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/171e2j/mysteries_of_a_road_less_traveled/,

I'm trying to work on and develop a site based around creepypasta, because as much as I love going to the Creepypasta Wikia or creepypasta.com, I have never felt like I have found a place that feels like a creepypasta community. Maybe I just haven't found a site that feels like a community yet. (I mean besides /r/creepypasta, but there is a huge difference between a site and a subreddit.)

So, my question for you readers is this: What are you looking for in a creepypasta site? I'd rather cater to the needs of those that are actually involved in the reading/writing of it.

Thanks,

I’ve been taking extra-curricular activities and doing extra-credit work all through middle school and high school. I guess you could say I’m a bit of an over-achiever; a know-it-all. Because of this, I earned a scholarship at a very prestigious college. Of course I, nor my parents, would pass up this great opportunity to enroll in such a high-end establishment.
After about five months at the school, I had already blended into the fabric of college life. The professors thought I was just this prodigy and really seemed to admire my work ethic. The students, as most do, ignored the nerdy guy. But even so, I found a friend amongst them. His name was Scott, and he’d never really been acknowledged as the greatest student. He was ¼ slacker and the other 3/4ths stand-offish. Though he wasn’t the brightest or the most social, we had enough in common to start a relationship I guess. 

One day, he asked me to attend a lecture with him; a speech by one of the psychology professors. I agreed, not having any classes or plans at the time the lecture was scheduled. That day, I swung my messenger bag over my shoulder and headed down to the lobby of the dorm building to meet Scott. We had a ways to walk, considering the lecture was being held in the far end of the campus. But we didn’t mind. It was fall, so it’s not as if it was bad weather or anything.
When we got to room 302, the meeting room, it was about 12:24 p.m. The lecture started at 12:30, so we were in good shape. However, there were no other people in the room. It wasn’t like we were an hour early. I thought about the possibility that maybe we were in the wrong room, but I checked and we weren’t. We sat down in the front row of about five rows of chairs. Scott nudged my arm.
“Great turn-out, huh?”
I chuckled in that awkward way strangers do when talking with other strangers. While I was sitting there, waiting for the lecturer to arrive, I thought about how little I knew Scott. And vise versa. We barely knew each others’ last names, let alone how to communicate like two normal individuals. I was snapped out of my thoughts by the sound of the opening of a door. I turned my head to see a tall man snake across the room and take his place behind the podium. He looked out at what were supposed to be filled seats.
“Nice that all of you could make it,” he said with a voice that seemed much kinder than the man he looked like “, well no matter, I’m glad you two were kind enough to show up. Of course, not many people are interested in this kind of thing.” I wondered for a moment what he meant by his last sentence, but I just smiled, humoring his obvious attempt at warming up to us. “My name is Professor Neye. I teach sociology and major in psychology. I graduated from this college in ‘84 at the top of my class. Today, I’d like to share with you the many wonders of the human brain…and mind.” There was a long pause, as if he was focusing on that word; mind. “If you have any questions, please save them for after the lecture. Now, I shall begin.” He turned around and started to draw on the white board. Before long, you could clearly make out the image of a brain, all of the parts outlined to identify different functions. He turned back to the two of us. “You,” he pointed to me “, your name please, son.”
“J-Jamie Loremann.” I replied hesitantly for some reason. He looked at me, noting my shaky reply, but ignoring it.
“Well Mr. Loremann,” he took his marker, tapping the brain drawing “, can you identify these parts of the brain please?”
“Yes sir,” I replied “, there’s the frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, parietal, and the occipital.”
“Very good,” he wrote down the names correlating with each part of the brain, then turned back to us again “, now, in psychology, you not only have to know which segments of the brain are which, but what functions they perform.” He pointed with the marker to the frontal lobe. “The frontal lobe, as I assume you both are familiar with, stores most dopamine neurons. Dopamine, of course, is a great factor in your motivational learning. So let’s say you lose that dopamine, you’ll be unmotivated and have little to no drive in life.” He moved the marker to the temporal lobe. “The temporal lobe has more to do with your long-term memory. It also is important with how you perceive language and sight. So don’t mess that up, or you could have a pretty significant crisis on your hands.” Something in his voice shifted, and Scott probably heard it too because he looked at me in that “this guy’s a wacko” way. I just brushed it off as nothing and continued to listen to the lecture.
“The function of the parietal lobe is mainly sensory of the body and how you perceive and understand numbers. If this part of the brain gets thrown out, you probably won’t be doing a lot of math.” He chuckled at the little joke he’d made. I thought that it was in bad taste and I could tell from Scott’s stifled cough that he thought so too. I was really surprised that Professor Neye didn’t sense the nervous/awkward air of the room, or maybe he did and just continued with the speech. “The occipital lobe is very important. It’s how we are able to visualize. If this gets damaged, there are very serious repercussions. For example, your vision could be seriously affected, or even lost. And you hallucinate.” He stopped, rubbing his forehead with his thumb and index finger. He closed his eyes, as if concentrating. “The things you see, like people who are gone, scary shit.” He was telling us as though this was his own story. Scott and I exchanged worried glances. 

Was he having a moment, a flashback, just a migraine? Just as I was about to speak up and ask if he was alright, he spoke again.
“The mind is such a complicated thing,” he said, almost in a murmur “, full of riddles and things you don’t want to be real. The demons and monsters from your nightmares, all coming alive right in front of you. And what makes it worse is that no one else can see them. No, no what’s even worse than that is that what I see, the creatures I see are real and they follow you. They follow, they follow, they follow-” He cut off in mid-sentence, looking out into nothing. He had a glassy look to his eyes and his mouth gaped open slightly. 
“Professor? Are you-” Before I could finish, his tall form fell forward onto the podium, lanky arms hanging over the front. The hanna hat he’d been wearing fell off as he did. Scott and I rushed up to him, wondering what in the hell had just happened to the man, when we saw it. A gun shot at the back of his head. The bullet would’ve gone right through his occipital lobe. We ran to get a professor, another student, anyone to help us. Thankfully, the librarian was organizing books and came to our aid. I will never forget those paramedics in their almost-too-white uniforms carrying a dead Professor Neye out of room 302, and through the doors to the awaiting ambulance. 

I couldn’t talk for the next month, not to anyone. It was one of those things that never really escape your mind. They’re always there, stuck like a wad of gum. Scott and I ignored each other after that day, both of us aware that if we so much as exchanged words, we’d remember that awful day in fall. I got through freshman year at the top of my class. All of my professors told me that my knowledge of the human mind could really help with possible career opportunities, especially if I took a psychology course. But I would never take psychology. Only Scott knew why. And losing our friendship was better for the both of us. 

I still think back to what Professor Neye said about the things that follow us. Maybe those things are experiences like the one Scott and I had. Or maybe they’re something totally different, I’m really not sure. All I know is that no matter if I can see them or not, they follow, they follow, they follow-

As people live day to day, I watch them and take the ones needed for my game. This is game of mine grows vastly as time pasts and soon I shall win. 
This game I'm talking about is one of chance. I choose one person random daily and pit them against something they fear the most. The people with rational fears I never take, they always end up taking their lives before the game is through. The most fun contestants are the ones with fear of imaginary creatures.
There are rules to this game: never take children, never allow the person you take to see you, and always make sure that the game is stacked in your favor. These are the main rules. There are others, but if you don't follow these, the game becomes dangerous for you.
As you put those people against these irrational fears, you're allowed to watch, to ensure that any persons entering into the game never makes it out. It's harder then you might think. I remember one game I watched. I had put a woman in her thirties against her fear of being eaten alive. You might think that it was zombies or even a werewolf, but it was dogs that I chose to be her adversaries. The area I chose for this particular game was the woods. Total cliche, but I like things old fashioned. As I watched this woman, she fought for her life, beating two of the dogs to death as a third grabbed her arm. She screamed in pain as she used a tree branch to beat the shit out of the one that was holding her. After that she ran, as another pack was sent in after her. This game lasted for more then three hours before a dog finally got her by the throat. She screamed and as more dogs arrived, she was eaten alive, just like she feared. Of course I helped the dogs. I have ways of altering the game map, moving pieces like in a game of chess. For her, I blocked her path and had her cornered by a wall of trees.
People might ask why I do what I do. It's quite simple, I put people against their fears so I can help them get over them. Like I said, I watch. I chose victims that have the most irrational fears and I put them in my games. So far, because the odds are always against them, no one has survived.
Over the years, numerous people have been taken by me. I see missing persons posters go up and the families never giving up. The bodies are never found because I dispose of them, making them disappear into nothing. No one has ever seen me and I'm sure no one ever will. Probably as your reading this, I'm watching you, reading your movements, finding your darkest fears.

If it's an obscure character (i.e. non-memes like Jeff, Slendy, or the Rake) please provide a link to their original story. And if you'd like to see a sequel to ""Slenderman and the Rake"" go and ask!

 I will leave this open until July 27, 2012. I will then pick whatever one I think will be the best and write a story about it. Thank you to all who participate.

Details never leaked out to the public until well after the fall of the iron curtain due to the unusual circumstances contained in the report.

The bodies of the hikers were found not far from their camp, which had been nearly destroyed. Investigators followed footprints to what looked to be the site of a small bonfire and the first two bodies. Inexplicably they were clad only in their underwear despite the bitter Russian winter, as if some force drove them from their camp before they could even dress. Three more were found in another location, looking as if they were trying to return to their doomed camp after their companions succumbed to hypothermia. None of the bodies were dressed for winter, some without even shoes, others with only strips of cloth on their feet torn from the clothing of the already dead.

If the circumstances were unusual, the autopsy proved to be completely bizarre. One of the students had major fractures to his skull, and another two had their ribs completely smashed. No external wounds or trauma were found. Medical experts compared the injuries to a high-speed car crash, stating it would be impossible for another human being to create injuries of their type without an external wound. Another camper, a young woman, had her tongue missing. While investigators initially suspected foul play, no footprints were found near any of the bodies other than the students' own. Adding to the mystery, the bodies were all shown to have high levels of radioactive contamination.

Nine years after the incident in the Ural mountains another group of hikers were found dead, this time in the Caucasus. The incident occured in late summer this time, however many similarities presented. The hikers' campsite was found destroyed and the campers forced to flee with little or no provisions. Rather than being spread out, the bodies were all found within a dozen yards of each other in a nearby clearing. The scene was described as horrifying by police. The bodies were positioned as if thrown at great speed, postured as if their bones had been smashed to splinters. The results of the medical investigation was immediately sealed by the Soviet government.

Again, each of the six bodies presented with high doses of radiation, despite a normal background radiation level around the site of their deaths. During autopsy, the medical examiner discovered that the initial description of the hikers' bones being smashed was incorrect. Their entire skeletons were entirely missing, despite having no external wounding whatsoever. High levels of calcium and other nutrients were found in their blood and surrounding tissues, as if something had somehow rapidly liquified the bone. Crime scene photos also revealed that the clearing the bodies were found in was not natural. Topographic maps taken only months before had shown the area to be a lush forest. Entire trees had been smashed to splinters in a path more than twenty meters wide and over a two hundred meter area.

Despite the Soviet crackdown on all information, it eventually leaked out as all such information does. Leading occult experts have gathered all available facts and were forced to come to a single, terrifying conclusion. No man or man-made device could have acted with such deliberate force or in the ways uncovered. Of all research available, only one entity could have been responsible. Something that was not meant for our earth, something that struck fear into the heart of a certain insane Arab.

The scientists had theorized that a human without access to any senses or ways to perceive stimuli would be able to perceive the presence of God.

They believed that the five senses clouded our awareness of eternity, and without them, a human could actually establish contact with God by thought. An elderly man who claimed to have “nothing left to live for” was the only test subject to volunteer. To purge him of all his senses, the scientists performed a complex operation in which every sensory nerve connection to the brain was surgically severed.* Although the test subject retained full muscular function, he could not see, hear, taste, smell, or feel. With no possible way to communicate with or even sense the outside world, he was alone with his thoughts.

Scientists monitored him as he spoke aloud about his state of mind in jumbled, slurred sentences that he couldn’t even hear. After four days, the man claimed to be hearing hushed, unintelligible voices in his head. Assuming it was an onset of psychosis, the scientists paid little attention to the man’s concerns.

Two days later, the man cried that he could hear his dead wife speaking with him, and even more, he could communicate back. The scientists were intrigued, but were not convinced until the subject started naming dead relatives of the scientists. He repeated personal information to the scientists that only their dead spouses and parents would have known. At this point, a sizable portion of scientists left the study.

After a week of conversing with the deceased through his thoughts, the subject became distressed, saying the voices were overwhelming. In every waking moment, his consciousness was bombarded by hundreds of voices that refused to leave him alone. He frequently threw himself against the wall, trying to elicit a pain response. He begged the scientists for sedatives, so he could escape the voices by sleeping. This tactic worked for three days, until he started having severe night terrors. The subject repeatedly said that he could see and hear the deceased in his dreams.

Only a day later, the subject began to scream and claw at his non-functional eyes, hoping to sense something in the physical world. The hysterical subject now said the voices of the dead were deafening and hostile, speaking of hell and the end of the world. At one point, he yelled “No heaven, no forgiveness” for five hours straight. He continually begged to be killed, but the scientists were convinced that he was close to establishing contact with God.

After another day, the subject could no longer form coherent sentences. Seemingly mad, he started to bite off chunks of flesh from his arm. The scientists rushed into the test chamber and restrained him to a table so he could not kill himself. After a few hours of being tied down, the subject halted his struggling and screaming. He stared blankly at the ceiling as teardrops silently streaked across his face. For two weeks, the subject had to be manually rehydrated due to the constant crying. Eventually, he turned his head and, despite his blindness, made focused eye contact with a scientist for the first time in the study.

He whispered “I have spoken with God, and he has abandoned us” and his vital signs stopped.

There was no apparent cause of death.



* follow-up study, 2000: Dr G.F., Department of Neurology, [hospital name witheld], San Francisco, CA. Recent study of a degenerative disease which targets the motor function and cognitive decline often leads to 'hallucinations' of the deceased. The death of targeted cells and chemicals in the brain by this disease leads to a loss of smell, among other senses. The cause of the disease is unknown.

He woke up in a cold sweat, the fourth night in a row. Every time he woke up, something didn’t feel right. There was a smell, similar to the one you smell right after lightning strikes on a dark and storm-riddled night. He escaped the confines of his sheets, hoping to disperse this unusual feeling that he’d felt ever since moving into the house a week before. He had been so excited to move in before, what with the steal he bought the house at; now he was starting to question why he had gotten it so cheap.

He walked across the creaking paneling of the floorboards, each creaking out like souls that dared to disturb the peaceful night. He approached his window and pulled back the curtains lazily. The moon pierced the sky with its stark white glow, just peeking out of the impending storm clouds on the horizon. The moonlight cast itself on to the barren barn roof, which was in need of quite a few repairs. He noted to himself to get on that…someday.

He gazed over to his nightstand and stared at the dull red glow of his alarm clock: 3:15 in the morning, just like every other night he’d awoken. He rubbed his creased forehead in irritation; he was getting much too old for this. Years had passed and nothing had changed. Well, not until recently, what with these random awakenings. The moon cast a light through the window through his window and he turned to gaze at it one last time before returning to his slumber.

The barn roof. No, had he actually seen it? He must have been more exhausted than he thought. Just a flicker of an image in his mind, a passing dream that had managed to just momentarily dip itself into his awakened consciousness. But it had seemed so real…though he was praying it wasn’t. He stood at the windowsill, eyes clenched tightly, staring into the black abyss of his eyelids. He stood there; convincing himself he had exhausted himself to the point of imagining things, and relaxed, opening his eyes.

It was still there. Why, why was it still there? He began to panic, his heart pounding wildly while his body remained still as a gravestone. He had to be imagining this…thing standing on the roof of his barn. It stood there, gazing directly at his window, with a wide grin on it’s face, head tilted just slightly to the side. Its eyes were wide, oh so wide, and the moonlight reflected off of them in the most uncomfortable of ways. It just stood there, it’s posture pristinely still, besides its tilted head, and stared. It just stared.

He took a step back, immediately regretting it. For his step back caused the figure to step forward; but this was no normal shift of the leg. The figure took the widest of steps, as if trying to cover as much space as he could in a stride before returning to his pristinely postured pose. His heart was about to rip out of his chest, he stood there, not sure what to do. He took another step, every so slowly and quietly, stepping onto a loose floorboard, resulting in a creak. He looked out the window to see it had taken another stride, almost at the edge of the roof now. It was cackling in a maniacal way, and it flooded the house with its horrifying chuckles. The moonlight illuminated the rest of the figure, its stark white skin and hollowed eyes, hair frayed into a nest of soiled strands, with its teeth just gleaming in the moonlight, protruding from his giant, crooked smile as he continued to stare directly into the window of his house.

His phone was too far to reach, he had run out of options besides dashing out of the room. He took a step back, never taking his eyes off the figure, and readied himself to sprint out of the room. He expected the figure to take another step, when instead it raised its arm, extending a bony, wretched finger, pointing past him, at his bedroom door. He twisted his head, terrified what might be behind him in the doorway. He turned and saw nothing, the doorway completely empty.

He stood there and immediately regretted his decision. He had done the one thing he had he shouldn’t have, taken his eyes off the barn. He stood in the dark of his bedroom, and turned slowly to his window, which was now pried wide open. The figure no longer was on the barn roof.

He heard a cackling from the closet…

Ever since I was a kid I didn't trust mirrors. Their shiny, reflective surfaces would always set me on edge. My older brother would even tease me, saying stuff like ""Watch out behind you!"" He'd even tell me stories about ""Shiny Suzy"". Some stupid story he came up with, about some girl who was murdered by her own reflection, she was found with her throat slit in her bathroom on her birthday. Apparently the cops titled it a suicide but locals would say the reflection of her self was frozen in her eyes permanently. My mom would always comfort me, tell me there was nothing to worry about. Yet I still always believed my brother. But anyway I'm getting off topic. 
	
It was new years eve, my roommate went out to some pub to get smashed. I was never into the bar scene anyway, I'd always just stay in the house on these kind of events. It just turned 12:00 and I heard the streets cheering echo through my hallways just as the ball dropped. I grabbed my half empty nos can and clinked drinks with my friend over skype. ""Cheers, maddafacka!"" We both chugged our drinks, said our goodbyes, called each other faggots, then logged off. Just a typical night. 
	
I flop over to my bed as I turn on the TV. Infomercials blast my dark walls with bright blue light flashing back and forth between cheap, novelty buffalo rings and middle aged men. bundle up in my blanket as I switch my TV to some cheap-laugh sitcom, have a chuckle or two, then flip over on my side and close my eyes. I've always slept with the TV on, all I need is the comforting sound. I rest my eyes for about 5 minutes, then open them out of curiosity of the gut busting laugh track on the TV. And there it was, right in front of me. My window, with it's shitty broken blinds giving a nice glimpse of the glass, with a bright backwards reflection of 30 rock staring back at me. I don't know what it was about it, maybe some old memories came flooding back, but my heart started pounding out of my chest. The TV sound drowned out, all that matters was my pure panic. My fear came charging back, I thought my phobia had passed a few years back but sure as shit not. I flip over on my bed, and gasp for air as I sit straight up. 
	
I reach for the empty cup next to me hoping for some form of liquid that could quench my thirst. I leap out of my covers and sprint down the dark hallway, my heart pounding like bongo drums. Louder, Louder, Louder. I stumble over a cardboard box, and slam into the bathroom and turn on the light. I slam on the faucet and rub my face full of warm water. Slowly my heart calms down, I take some deep calm breaths, and wipe off my face. I slowly look up and straight forward. I jump straight back in fear. 
""It's your own reflection you dumb fuck"" I mutter to myself. I start chuckling like a maniac, then stare back at my reflection. I guess I decided it was time to have a self-bash comedy house session. I analyze my every imperfection with a stupid shit-eating grin on my face. My weird ears, stupid hairline, that scar I have on my forehead from the time I fell into my glass coffee table, my lop sided dimples, that stupid mole on my right cheek. I just laugh and laugh, wipe off my hands, and walk back to my room chuckling. I shut my door, crawl into bed laughing, shut my blinds, and start watching TV. Suddenly, after that dilemma, something still doesn't feel right. I've forgotten something, I must have. I think back on every silly little detail. Eventually I end up giving up, tossing over in my bed and staring at my window. It was just then, as I stared at my reflection that I realized it.

**10 FOUND DEAD AT DESTROYED LABORATORY **

""Local authorities found the bodies of 7 men and 3 women at a destroyed laboratory earlier today. All victims had been horribly burned, and had many broken bones. Police are still uncertain of what caused the victim's deaths and what caused the facility to be destroyed.""


It was the day of my grandfathers funeral. It was raining heavily that day, and the sadness of all our family members, friends, or people my grandfather new had filled the air. No one cried. I had wondered why no one was crying at the funeral today on our way home. Maybe it was because my grandfather had touched them all in such a way that they respected him so much, and wanted to leave him with dignity. Plus, my grandfather was always the guy who could make you smile. They must have remembered the good times they spent with him. I know I did.

My parents took me with them to my grandfathers' lawyers office a few days later. You know, the reading of his will and such. It was mostly the stuff you would think. His house, his dog, his money and who gets it right? Well, then we got to me. I was very surprised when I heard my name. I didn't really expect anything, since my grandfather always taught me to be independent and not take handouts. We all listened intently as the lawyer read:

""And to my grandson, I leave my journal.""

This just made everything even stranger. His journal? Why would he give me something like that? Maybe he had a lesson to teach me threw his words and thought I could use it. I reluctantly took the journal and examined it as some kind of alien object. After the reading was done, we went home.

I was really eager to begin reading the book as soon as I got home. Who knew what kind of mysteries my grandfather had tucked away from us? I read the journal, front to back. The first part of it was mostly boring stuff. Somewhere in the middle of the book my grandfather had begun talking about the experiments he was working on in russia, and that is when I really started getting into it. What kind of experiments were they working on that they didn't want us to know about? he talked of trying to find an even stronger nuke than they have ever had before, or some new element that they would try to use. Most of those were failed and they had to keep trying. The next part of this story are the pages of my grandfathers journal, starting at May 3rd and ending May 12th, 1943.
___________________________________________________________

May 3rd, 1943

Things in the lab have been going quite well. We are making progress on a new type of nuclear warhead.  We've discovered how to keep the element stable while inside the bomb before it explodes. We just need to put further research into it before we actually send it off to main nuclear research facility. I've gotten to meet the team over these past few days. They all seem like determined scientists to me. There is one fellow i'm not too sure about though. Don't get me wrong, he's one of the best i've seen in a long time. The man can figure out some of the things I've been working on for ages. There is just something about him that just seems a little....off to me. He acts like someone is always watching him. He'll look around at us suspiciously, like we are taking notes on all of his behavior. Apparently, he is the one scientist who comes up with the ideas for the weaponry. I have yet to see any of his latest ideas.

May 5th, 1943

That man is beginning to give me the creeps. All he does is sit in his room, only to come out for meals and hand us a new design plan. What could he be doing in there? Is it something we aren't supposed to know about? Perhaps, but I am going to find out what he does in there. Maybe tomorrow, but for now, I need my rest. Designing weapons of mass destruction isn't a cakewalk.

May 6th, 1943

There is definitely something going on back there that he doesn't want anyone to see. Today, I knocked on his door, to see if he would answer. All i got was a soft ""yes?"" and I asked him if I could enter. He, like I expected, declined. So I pushed him a little, and continuously asked him why and if I could enter. I got repeated ""No""s, so I gave up. At this point I am extremely suspicious of what goes on behind that locked door, so I ask one of the other scientists about it, one of his close friends. All I got were worried looks and rushed conversations, like they didn't want to talk about it. I'm getting frustrated not having answers.

May 8th, 1943

Today I asked one of the scientists for a detailed tour of the entire facility, hoping I might find out more about what that man is doing behind that door. I got what I expected, a very detailed tour of the facility. Quite a few scientific breakthroughs happened here, and I couldn't be happier to be here. When we walked by the man's room, I asked my tour guide who's room this was. Sure, I played dumb, but it worked. Only slightly though. I discovered that the man's name is Severin Elmersson, and that he works on special projects in there. Ones that only he is allowed to work on. I also discovered that they are currently working on his newest top secret one in the guarded part of the facility. I always thought that was strange when I came here that they would have one part of the facility guarded when only we are out here.

May 10th, 1943

I was finally able to get a chance to talk to Severin today. He seems like a very nice man, off, but nice. We talked of some of the ideas he had come up with in the past, and I found that he was the man who personally oversaw the development of russia's first nuclear bomb, but was discharged for reasons he didn't say. I wanted to know more about what he oversaw, but he could only tell me one thing: ""Something that is so powerful, that it could change the face of the world forever."" I didn't question him on this matter anymore, knowing that I wouldn't get anymore information. I also discovered that he was from Sweden, hence his odd name. After we were done talking, Severin invited me to come to his personal workspace tomorrow, which is the guarded part of the facility. He said he would call off the guards between 11:00 A.M. and 2:00 P.M., and that if I didn't make it in time, I would miss somthing truly remarkable. I accepted, and then he rushed out of the room, not even saying goodbye, or that it was nice talking to me. I pondered what he said earlier. ""..that it could change the face of the world forever.""
___________________________________________________________

I searched all of over my grandfathers journal to find the entry on May 11th. It wasn't there. I couldn't really do anything about it, so I just read the next entry.
___________________________________________________________

May 12th, 1943

It was horrible. That horribly disfigured...THING. I don't know what I saw, and I don't want to. I am writing this from an inn very far away from the facility. I didn't write an entry for yesterday because I had left in too much of a hurry. I'll recall the events that took place yesterday inside the guarded part of the facility, but if anyone else is reading this, please be warned: do not tell anyone of these events. They will hunt you down.

At about 12:24 P.M., I went to the guarded part of the facility, eager to see what awaited me. Like Severin said, there were no guards at the entrance, and I was able to walk right in. As I walked in, I heard footsteps around the corner. Severin came to greet me as I entered, and he had a very excited and happy look on his face. He greeted me warmly, like an old friend, and led me through the hallway.
""So Severin, what is it you wanted to show me today?""
""Oh you'll see it soon enough. Trust me, you won't want to miss it.""
We turned the corner, and Severin's best friend who was a fellow scientist was there to meet us. He didn't greet me nearly as warmly as Severin did, and was quite reluctant to see me. He led us to the testing chamber here. This is where we test the stability of some of the most dangerous elements. There was a white sheet over the chamber. I asked Severin what was behind the sheet, and he nodded and ripped the sheet off. What I saw next was horrific. I had no idea what it was, but it was a horribly disfigured creature that made these odd noises as the other scientist ripped the sheet off. I stared, and slowly walked up to the glass, fixated on the creature. I couldn't muster a word at what I was looking at, but I eventually did. ""What is this thing!?!"" Severin walked up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. ""Something that will change the face of the world, my friend."" He then moved away to a terminal, and then I saw some gas starting to fill the chamber. It made the creature go completely insane, banging it's head on the walls and floor, and just jumping trying to get out. I asked what he was filling the room with, and he replied: ""The fuel."" I was terrified, and I told Severin that I needed to leave. ""Leave? why? You don't want to witness anymore of this miracle?"" ""Miracle? That is no miracle! That is an abomination!"" ""Come now, don't be so frantic."" I had begun to ran down the hallway as he said that. I decided that I needed to leave that night. Leave the facility.
___________________________________________________________

After I read that entry, I sat in my chair for a few moments, staring at the bottom of the page. What was it that he saw? What could have terrified my granfather so much that he gave up on his entire career? My grandfather didn't make any entries after that one for a very long time. I finally found one that was a bit more recent.
___________________________________________________________

May 29th 1990

I can't believe I found this old journal. Today was the day that Boris Yeltsin was elected as president, and that brought back memories of the motherland. I decided to go back through some old stuff that I had shoved in the basement. I found this journal in an old trunk. I was reading some of my really old entries from the past. The adventures I had when I was kid with my friends, my college years, the start of the Russian Nuclear Program. All fond memories, and I couldn't put it down. But then I got to the may entries of 1943. I must have been exposed to some radiation during this, because I don't remember any of that beyond May 10th. Maybe I had been taking a lot of pain killers at that time. I don't know, but it was extremely strange reading what I read.
___________________________________________________________

A few days ago, I had to do a school newspaper on the russian nuclear weapons development. I instantly thought of my grandfathers journal, and I did my report over what he said. I didn't include the parts about whatever my grandfather saw though.

What really disturbed me was the research I had gathered while I was writing the paper. I looked up on Wikipedia about a man named Severin Elmersson. It had said that he was arrested in 1957 for animal cruelty. They had discovered odd green beings in his basement, that had the resemblance of a pig without arms, and standing on four legs. I learned that the facility he worked at was completely destroyed on May 14th, 1943.

As you do so, look for a restaurant, preferably of Italian theme. Enter, and when the waiter approaches, ask for the Holder of Dinner’s Special.

If the waiter answers by saying they do not have such a special, then you will not be finding Her here. It is just as well that you order something else, for your meal will still be exquisite if it is a good enough restaurant.

If the waiter answers by saying “Ah, an excellent choice, sir. I shall get it right away,” instead, thank them politely. When they walk away, they shall look back at you with a face of utmost disgust.

When your waiter returns, they shall ask you to follow them to the manager. Follow, and when you pass through the kitchen the music will stop playing and a silence will descend upon you. The kitchen shall be full of pies, with an intolerable stench coming from them. 

When the waiter opens the door to the manager’s office, you shall enter into a strange scene. It will feel different than any sensation you have felt before, and you will not be able to escape the room until She has her way. If you have fear in you yet, you will not survive.

The strange feeling room will be larger than it should be, with a large table able to fit at least ten per a side with magnificent chandeliers on the ceiling. The red gem stones hanging from them, however, shall fill you with dread if you are still worth being called a human - they are the blood of those who disappointed the Holder.

“Would you like to dine?” She shall ask, the gracious host in her dazzling attire. You will not be able to name the clothes she wears, or describe them after you leave. Say yes, refusal will mean your demise here. A mute waiter shall serve the two of you the most succulent meals you have ever tasted, and the finest wine.

While dining, She shall tell you about two siblings, one born in the morning and the other at noon. She shall scoff at their foolishness, and expect you to agree that the two of them are foolish in their efforts. When she finishes her tale, she shall tell you that she was the third born in her family, and that her brothers have told her of you.

“What do you seek the Objects for?” she shall ask, and answer honestly without hesitation. “What shall you do for Them?” she shall ask. Answer honestly and without hesitation once again. And finally, she shall ask: “Who will you let stand in your way?”

Do not hesitate. Do not pause. Do not even think about what you do as you rush forward now, stopping will give her all she needs to finish you off there and now. With whatever is in your hand - knife, fork, spoon, wine glass, napkin, it does not matter - you must strike her with it, or she shall strike you down and with your blood make her lipstick and more gems for her chandelier. 

When you strike her, only do so once. A smile will come on her face, and she will snap her fingers. Her waiter shall come out, carrying a covered platter. When he removes the cover, a bottle of the finest wine that you will ever see shall be present, mixed with the blood of each and every leader throughout history.

“You have shown your desire. You may have this."" She shall hand you the bottle. No matter how badly injured she was from your strike, the injury shall be gone the moment you take the bottle.

That bottle is One Object of 538. Shattering it would be much like separating Them, wouldn't it be?",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1dw3e3,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1dw3e3/the_holder_of_dinner/,

Here is the post for those of you who haven't already heard about this:

""Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough, you’ll see some pretty sick shit. This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly of the internet. I’ve seen quite a few things I don’t care to admit to, but one thing that I’ll always remember is a site called “normalpornfornormalpeople.com”.

The first strange thing about the site was that I didn’t find it by actually looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn’t know. The e-mail was as follows:

“Hi there
found this site is very nice thought u might like
normalpornfornormalpeople.com
pass it on, for the good of mankind”

Pretty standard issue chain letter, although the url and the last remark really piqued my curiosity. I was having a very boring day when I got this, so I made sure my anti-virus was working and then I clicked on it.

It was a very average, very generic looking site. It gave the impression that the creators just BARELY gave a shit about making it look professional. The author seemed to have a very tenuous grasp on English, and on the front page was a long, boring, and incoherent rant that I don’t remember or have saved.

The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven’t figured out the meaning of), which was;
“Normal Porn for Normal People, A Website Dedicated To The Eradication of Abnormal Sexuality”

And from the sound of that, I wasn’t sure whether I was here to watch porn or if I had stumbled onto some kind of eugenics program. But I was here now, and I was very, very curious to see what “Normal People” get their rocks off to. So I scrolled down through the rant and…nothing. The page didn’t seem to link to anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was its own hyperlink.

So I clicked one of them, and was sent to a white page with very long list of links in the form of:
“normalpornfornormalpeople.com/ (random letters)”

So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will rape my computer. I figured I’d just try it for maybe 5 minutes, just to see if anything came up. I clicked one of the links, and was sent to another page. This page apparently had totally different urls than the last one.
I was just about to say “Fuck this” when I clicked on the 3rd link, and a video download came up. It was called “peanut.avi”. It was a 30 minute video of a man, a woman and a dog in a kitchen. The woman would make a peanut butter sandwich, and the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for 30 minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of it.

I know what you’re thinking: “What the hell does that have to do with porn?” I have no clue. I’ve seen a little over two dozen videos from this site, and the majority had no sexual activity at all.

After watching peanut.avi, I went on a certain image board I frequent to play online show and tell, like I always do with weird shit like this. But someone had already made a thread about it, some guy who had received the same chain letter I did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig through the site, and that’s how I saw other videos.

Most of those two dozen videos were very uneventful, and consisted of people talking to the cameraman in a room with nothing in it but a desk and a few chairs. I mean literally nothing on the walls, or in terms of furniture. The whole room had a very cold, sterile feel to it.

The conversations were just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people were filming or what the site was about, but of course, nothing. You would never know these videos had anything to do with porn if you saw it out of context. I will say one thing though, the people who appeared in these videos were quite attractive.

However, the other videos that actually did feature content which I suppose could be called “sexual” is where things got weird.

I’ll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos, if you’re really eaten up with curiosity you can try to hunt them down on a torrent site.

lickedclean.avi

A 10 minute video filmed by a hidden camera in which we see a repairman working on a washing machine for the first 2 minutes. When it’s fixed, the repairman talks to the owner briefly, and then leaves. The owner checks to make sure the repairman is gone, and he begins to lick all over the top of the washing machine. This goes on for 7 minutes.

jimbo.avi

A 5 minute video of an obese mime performing his act. It was actually pretty funny, particularly one part where he pretends to pull up a chair, then pretends that it breaks because of his weight. In the last 30 seconds of the video, the camera cuts to static briefly and cuts back to the man sobbing quietly, still wearing mime outfit and makeup. Some kind of obscure fetish?

dianna.avi

4 minute video in which the camerman talks to a woman in a room different from the “interview room.” This room looks like one you’d find in a normal person’s house. Exactly where they are is never specified, as Dianna only talks about her violin playing. She obviously plays her violin, but she keeps getting distracted by something.

I didn’t notice this until someone on the image board thread pointed it out, but if you look at the mirror in the background, you can see a fat man in a chicken mask masturbating.

jessica.avi

Another 4 minute cameraman video. This time he’s outside a house, talking to another young woman. They talk about canoe rides. The camera zooms out to reveal the city streets behind them occasionally.

The strange thing is: No one so far has been able to identify where this street is. Guesses have ranged everywhere from Europe to Australia to the Philippines, but there’s yet to be a match for the street shown in the video.

tonguetied.avi

10 minute video. The first 5 minutes consist of an elderly woman making out with a mannequin. The video cuts out like it did in jimbo.avi halfway through, and the scene is now a group of mannequins huddled together in a circle around the camera. The lights have been dimmed, and the elderly woman is nowhere to be seen. From this point on, there is no sound.

stumps.avi

5 minute long video where a man with no legs is attempting to breakdance on a DDR mat in what looks like the kitchen from peanut.avi, but much dirtier. There’s a radio playing music unseen in the background, but it stops at the 4 minute mark when the man collapses on the mat in exhaustion.
He breathes heavily and pleads with someone off-screen to let him rest. This off-screen person becomes terrifyingly enraged and yells at him to keep dancing, which he does. You can hear this off-screen person begin to scream as the video ends abruptly.

privacy.avi

The woman from dianna.avi is masturbating on a mattress in the “interview room,” while the man from stumps.avi walks around on his hands while wearing some kind of goblin mask.
The door in this room was always closed in other videos, but it’s now open. In this video the only light is in the room, and the hallway is dark. Near the end of the video, you can see an animal quickly run through the hallway.

And finally the last video we uncovered: useless.avi

In this 18 minute video, a blonde woman from one of the previous interview videos is tied down to a mattress in the interview room. She attempts to scream but her mouth is taped over. After 7 minutes, a man in a black suit and mask opens the door, but he does not enter.
He holds the door open for the animal that was running in the hall in the previous video. It’s revealed to be an adult chimpanzee, its hair shaved and its entire body painted red. It seemed to be starved and abused, with several wounds along it’s shoulders and back. Added by Furbearingbrick
When the chimp enters the room, the masked man closes the door behind it. The chimpanzee sniffs the air for a moment (it may have been blind), and notices the woman tied to the mattress. It goes into a frenzy, and begins to maul her.
The assault goes on for a grueling 7 minutes, until the woman finally dies. The chimp eats flesh from her corpse for 4 minutes as the video ends.

The thread exploded with activity after this video was uncovered, and people discussed it long into the night. When I came back to the image board the next day I found that the thread was deleted. I tried to start another one, and they banned me. I tried e-mailing the guy who sent me the chain letter with the site’s url, sent him 5 messages and never got a response.

I have tried to discuss this website on various places, and I got banned frequently. The site itself was also deleted about 3 days after useless.avi was uncovered, likely because someone contacted the authorities about it.

The only proof that normalpornfornormalpeople.com ever existed was a few screencaps people took, and videos from the site that people saved and uploaded on torrents. The most popular of which being useless.avi, which found its way onto a few gore sites.

Wherever you upload them to, all of the videos from normalpornfornormalpeople.com get deleted after a while.""",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1364230944.0,,,True,t3_1azd7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1azd7p/normalpornfornormalpeoplecom_or_uselessavi/,

Mother,

Sorry to bother you again. I know you'll say it's the over thinking and overly anxious way I have thought all my life, but I know it's not just me whose counting on my success. It's times like this where I need to stop, breathe, and realise I have this, I've studied endlessly and I have clear targets, I just need to concentrate.

Mother,

This semester flew by, I am treated like just another American kid!
I can't wait to come home and see the family!

Mother,

I'm in the families house now, they were incredibly welcoming and couldn't tell me apart from their own child, though neither did my professors or classmates. Thats the beauty of freshman year, unless your with people from your old high school or home town, everyone's a stranger! Besides, I look just like his ID card. It's the middle of the night here and I'm ready to do what is necessary. The house, as we had researched, is isolated and no one will hear a thing. The family are recluses as we'd been told by our old neighbours and their new ones. They are going to help me clean up the mess.

I hope your ready to start living the American dream!

I waited a moment for the cloudiness of my brain to disappear before I got out of bed. I couldn’t tell you why I decided to get up and walk out of my bedroom; I guess I just felt the beckoning of its sinister energy calling to me from behind the walls.

 As I opened my bedroom door, it creaked loudly and broke the oppressive silence. That’s when I saw it. Glancing to my left I caught a glimpse of a door in the wall that I hadn’t seen before. It was as if the house had expanded an extra ten feet to create this portal into the darkness. Without hesitation, I sauntered towards the door with both curiosity and a strange sense of peace. Whatever was inside those walls wanted me to come after it. It wanted to befriend me.

A light had begun to emanate around this strange new entrance. The door glowed with a nuclear green so enticing that I could do nothing to stop myself from opening the portal and climbing inside. I looked around the perplexing room, I found myself staring at what seemed to be desk lamps made out of human skin. Oddly, I was not frightened; in fact, I had almost no emotion at all towards this grotesque display of the human form. The lamps surrounded the bed, which sat directly in front of me, soiled and rotten. The whole room smelled like putrid flesh and the bright green glow had subsided to a forest green aura. 

I heard a noise to my right; it came out of a corner so dark I had to squint in an attempt to perceive the figure that resided in the blackness. He moved into the light. He did not speak, but somehow I knew what he wanted. I sat down on the bed and watched him creep his way over to sit down next to me. He was scaly and hunched and had a slow crooked walk. His skin even camouflaged him into the walls of the room. The thing that struck me most about this creature were his eyes; they were like black holes into an abyss and staring into them made you feel as if you were falling into that very abyss. There was nothing human about this creature, nothing at all.

He sat down next to me and stroked my hand, as if to say, “Do not fear me,” and I didn’t. I noticed on the desk next to the bed lie a gruesome pair of rusty scissors and what can only be described as a tiny heart-shaped pillow made from human flesh. The pillow was no more than two square inches and it was clearly going through the natural process of decay. He did nothing more than look at me, but once again, I knew what he wanted; he wanted to sew that tiny pillow into me. 

I did not struggle, I did not scream, I did not wince, I just watched as he sliced through my right thigh with the rusty scissors until the bone glistened from beneath the muscle. He smiled. He carefully picked up the heart-shaped flesh pillow and tucked it away tightly into my leg. His long dirty fingernails crept along my skin as he watched the pillow settle down into my being. His joy was overwhelming as he reached for a needle and thread to sew me up. I couldn’t help but feel a deep love for this creature suddenly; a kind of love that transcends all human emotion, a love for which there is no word. He sewed me up with care and precision then I promptly got up and left the mysterious room. I limped back into my bedroom and fell back asleep without any difficulty. 

The next morning when I woke up, I thought the previous night had been merely a strange and beautiful nightmare. Then suddenly, to my surprise, I felt a horrific surge of pain through my leg. Thinking that it was all in my head, I threw back the covers to prove to myself that the pain was all psychological. The smell hit me before I could actually process what I was seeing; layer upon layer of infection and decay raced through my nasal cavity. I was going to be sick. Was I going to be sick? My head hurt and I was dizzy as I stood up to limp to the bathroom. I drew myself a bath desperately trying to clean the filth off me. It didn’t work. 

Days went by before I mentioned my bizarre injury to anyone; who would believe me anyway? When the pain finally became too much to bear, I decided I would show my mother, who worked as a nurse in the local emergency room. I was standing in my living room as she lounged on the couch; I carefully inched down my jeans just enough to expose my right thigh. She gasped and the color instantly drained from her face. “What the hell happened to you?” She was nearly screaming. Before I could answer her, I saw my father slither his way into the room. He stood behind my mother; he put his index finger up to his mouth and mimed “Shhh.” Then from behind his back he pulled out the pair of rusty scissors that were used to slice open my thigh, my blood still stained on the blades. My heart sank. My mother was still staring at me, her mouth gaping and her eyes flooding with tears; she clearly couldn’t compose herself enough to speak again yet. I looked into my father’s eyes for some kind of explanation, but now in place of his eyes were two black holes darker than the deepest black man has ever known. As I peered into them I began to feel like I was falling. I *was* falling. I hit the ground with a painful and echoing thud. The last thing I remember is my father standing over me, rusty scissors in hand, burrowing deep into my soul with those lifeless eyes.

Inside this small town, there is a strange building, and while most of the city appeared to be out of touch with the times, this building was particularly old. It was wooden, like most are in Lenoresfield, and it was a squat building with a weather-worn sign outside. The sign once proclaimed in golden letters the name of the building, Os Immortale. It was a mask shop once, and if one peered beyond the time stained thick glass, one could see two or three masks still hanging on the walls. My grandfather told me the story about the man who owned the shop. 

He spent hours working on the masks that hung around the walls of his shop. That he loved his work was undeniable, and many referred to his shop has his second wife. They would not be too far off in this assumption, considering he had thrown himself into his shop after his first wife had died in a carriage accident. What was worse was a couple of nights after she had been buried, body snatchers stole her body away. After that, the mask maker was never the same. 

He would often be seen up late in his work shop, painting and fitting masks, and he always had this haggard look on his face, as if he was too tired of this world, and didn't want to live in it for much longer. Or at least, that was his face when he wasn't at his work bench. When he was there, working, his beady little eyes were focused on the mask, and the mask seemed to come to life beneath his fingers, almost as if he was working with real flesh. The paint dripped from the end of his brush like dew from the end of blade of grass, and as it spread across weaving strange shapes, the mask maker's frown would slowly turn into a smile. 

One night, many months after the passing of his wife, the mask maker shut his shop down for three whole weeks. Naturally, this came as a surprise to most of the townsfolk, as none could recall the last time he had closed his shop for so long a time. When he finally reopened the shop, his face drooped lower than ever, and not even working at the bench filling the backlog of requests that he had gotten seemed to cheer him up. If anything, it seemed to sadden him even more. He started barring entrance to those who got too curious about his workshop and those three weeks that he had shut himself in. 

In the months that followed, he often was seen muttering to himself as he worked, a new habit he had picked up, and among the words heard were ""Demons,"" and, ""I should of never tried it."" My grandfather himself witnessed first hand the owner's mutterings when he went to pick up a mask for his sister. The old man was not aware of my grandfather, and spoke aloud the name Ba'alzamon. My grandfather did not recognize the name, so he assumed that Ba'alzamon was simply a foreigner. My grandfather told me that the mask maker was bent over on something he could not see, though it was clearly not a mask, and he was quite certain if he hadn't knocked one of the masks off of its place on the counter by accident, the old mask maker would of continued working on his project.

As it were, the mask fell and bounced off of the floor, taking several solid objects with it, all of which made a rather loud ruckus. The old man's visage when he turned around was frightful, it left my grandfather, a wee child at the time, in hysterics for weeks, so much so that he refuses to this day to even go near Os Immortalis. The face my grandfather described was only one of madness, of a man who has lost something precious and he only knew it after he lost it, and desperately wants it back, and would do anything to get it back. 

As my grandfather was fleeing the workshop, he swore that out of the corner of his eye, he saw the mask maker's dead wife sitting on the stool, smiling at her husband as he worked.

THE SMITH MURDERS. PART I

 

 

Lisa Smith sat upon her living room couch next to her sister, the howling wind and rain battering the house in the midst of a humid night in late August. The television offered a reprieve from the melancholy of the weather. The family dog, Hugo, a large german shepard, was sleeping on the front porch. Kaylin was dozing next to Lisa, her long blond hair covering most of her face. Lisa was 20 as of a

week ago, Kaylin was only 13. As Kaylin slept, Lisa gazed at her younger sibling, the light from the television flickering off of her face. Deep in thought as to how someone as innocent as her sister had managed to survive in such a vile, hate-filled world, Lisa brushed the hair away from in front of her sister's face; admiring the quiet beauty and innocence that seemed to radiate from her younger kin.

 

""Come on,"" Lisa said,""let's get you in bed."". Lisa tapped her sister's shoulder, ""Come on"" she said mockingly, as if she was motivating a kitten to climb its first stair. She tapped her sister's shoulder again, a grimace dawning on Kaylin's face as she was roused from her slumber.

""Le'me alone"", Kaylin grumbled,

""Ill sleep on the couch"".

 

Lisa got up, ""Suit yourself, but don't blame me if you wake up feeling like shit
tomorrow from sleeping the wrong way"".

 
""I don't care, let me sleep""

 

""Fine, see you in the mornin'"", the slight southern twang came out of Lisa naturally, having been raised
in Florida her whole life.

 
She rounded the corner out of the living room and started upstairs, she went to the bathroom and took a shower.

 
20 minutes later, she stepped out of the bathroom, only a towel wrapped around her. She walked into her room and reached for her hairbrush, she looked at the housephone next to it.

 
It rang, startling her momentarily. Who would be calling at 2 in the morning? she thought. She checked the caller ID,

 
""PRIVATE NUMBER""

 
She shrugged, and answered the phone. Holding it to her ear as she put on her pink pajamas.

 
""Hello?"" she said.

 
All she heard was someone breathing.

 
""Hello?""

 
Only the long, drawn-out breaths responded to her.

 
Annoyed, she snapped ""I'm going to hang up now!""

 
""Lisa"" the voice said, it was deep and coarse.

 
""Yes that's me, who are you and why are you calling so late?""

 

"" I remember the first time I saw you. You were... so beautiful.."" The voice was calm, precise, and unnerving,
""Those eyes, more blue than the ocean itself.""

 
""Who are you?""

 
""It's been a long time Lisa, I've thought about you everyday..""

 
Fear ignited in Lisa, ""WHO IS THIS? I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE!""

 
""We've met once, I don't think you remember. You didn't give me the time of day to talk to you. You were much too busy with your group of friends to notice me..""

 
""I'M CALLING THE POLICE!""

 
"" You know, you really should buy some new pajamas. Pink just isn't your color.""

 
Hugo started barking outside, the wind and the rain nearly masking his massive barks. The hairs on the back of Lisa's neck shot straight out, her body stiffened.

 

""Your dog's name is Hugo, right? Oh my, he is playful isn't he? Too bad I'm more of a cat person."" the voice laughed heartily. Lisa heard a loud yelp, then silence. The rain still pattering the windows of her room. ""Hey listen, I'm gonna
have to let you go real quick. I'll see you soon.""

 
The voice hung up.

 
Lisa was terrified, paralyzed in fear, her brain breaking down everything that just happened piece by piece. She thought about who it could have been, how he got her number, and how he knew about her dog and pajamas.

 
She snapped back to reality, grabbing the phone and putting it up to her ear.

 
No Dial-tone.

 
""Oh shit,"" she said to herself. The fear burning inside her with the heat of a thousand suns.

 
The power went out.

 
She flew out her room and into her father's room, grabbing the gun from her father's sock drawer. She ran downstairs and to the front door, yelling for her sister to wake up and to stay inside. Lisa swung the door open and walked outside, taking the safety off of the pistol. It was raining harder now, the wind shifting towards her, the raindrops hurtling at her like bullets. Ignoring the sting of the pelting rain, and forgetting to shut the door, she ran around the side of the house to the circuit breaker, only to find an axe lodged deep within the fuses.

 
""Oh my god,"" she said. Hearing a noise behind her, she whirled around and blindly fired 2 shots into the attacker.

 
It yelped.

 
The lifeless body of Hugo slumped onto the ground, the rain matting his fur down and washing the blood from his fatal wounds. His eyes looked at her, unblinking, unforgiving, seeming to ask 'why?'. She fell to her knees as she picked up her childhood friend and companion. The tears began to flow now, the wave of guilt of having taken the life of another being she loved crashing over her.

What was that? The only coherent thought I could manage…

My dog was the only thing in the room with me. She sat curled up on top of a pillow over on the futon not even five feet from me. She too looked up, but not at the room, rather at me. She gave a small yawn and made to sit, perched upon her pillow. I knew that look… She was expecting me to give an order.

“Come, Daisy,” I said, patting the bed beside me.
I knew this feeling too… It was the feeling I got before I saw something awful… I had been having problems with hallucinations for a few months, but most of them were as ridiculous as they were terrifying. One in particular jumped to mind whenever I thought about the most ridiculous hallucination I’d had yet. It happened about two weeks ago… Being a proud Brony and a newbie Redditor, I had seen a .gif file under the Mylittlenosleep subreddit of a window in a dark room. No moon, no lights, nothing… The way it was designed, it made the viewer focus very intently on the window, ignoring the rest of the frame. I did just this… Then a lightning bolt illuminates the frame of a macabre, bloddied, albeit happy Pinkie Pie. Of course, at the time, I had given a slight startle, but didn’t think anything else of it. That is until later that night… I needed to use the restroom, and decided not to take a flashlight. I figured that night as good as any other to get myself used to either seeing these things, or to get over them. It took me only a few minutes, and I made a concerted effort not to turn on any lights. Upon crossing the threshold back into my bedroom, I stopped. Something was wrong… My shades had seen some damage and one was missing, letting a very defined streak of light through. Tension began to bulid up in the back of my head the longer I stood there. After maybe twelve seconds she appeared. My whole body was coiled as tight as a spring, but for some reason, I couldn’t move. She spoke to me then as single phrase.

“GO TO SLEEP”
As one could imagine, I wasn’t inclined to obey the order that night. As I sat in my bed, stroking Daisy’s head, I turned the events of that night over in my head once again, then spoke aloud.

“Go away, Pinkie. I don’t want to see you tonight.”
In all honesty, I felt completely silly for talking to something that didn’t stand a chance of exsisting. Still, just saying it out loud gave me a bit of comfort. Even with the comfort I had given myself, something seemed out of place… I got up then, throwing my legs over my bedside and stood. Daisy scurried off then back to the futon. The atmosphere in my room was choking… I didn’t like it… Even with the fan running. I pressed the “stop” button on the little control panel near my light switch. The switch itself didn’t actually do anything due to the house’s faulty wiring. It was a real hassle… Daisy gave a yelp suddenly. I spun around to see what was wrong, only to reel at what was presented to me. She was dead… Skewered through the neck with what appeared to be a kitchen knife… But the knife hadn’t come from my kitchen… It had a chrome handle. My knives had the black hilts… It took me a few moments to calm down, but I finally mustered the nerve to approach. Why I hadn’t gone and got my step-mother who had a revolver at her bedside right then and there is beyond me, but I approached… Took hold of the glimmering hilt… Pulled…

“THAT’S MINE.” A deep, unnatural-sounding voice came. It sounded like the source was a heavy smoker with some serious bronchitis…
Panicked, I spun about, slashing blindly into the dark.

Someone caught my wrist… A face I knew too well accompanied that hand… That ghostly pale visage… Perfectly round eyes, black as midnight… No eyebrows… No nose… Wide grin… As though the man’s cheekbones had been stripped of skin…

“Jeff… The Killer…”
He tilted his head for a moment, his already disgusting grin widening in the slightest. He knew he had me stunned… So stunned in fact that he took his time in removing the knife from my grip. It was so… Nonchalant… Upon returning to myself, I was suddenly filled with anger.

“You’re not welcome in this world.”

“GO TO SLEEP.” He said, just as he had in all those ridiculous creepypasta stories...
Just as he drew back to strike, I ducked left and shoved him. He probably wasn’t expecting this as it had bought me just enough time to dive for my bed and take up the Louisville Slugger on the other side. He was just turning around when I was in position, poised to swing.

He’s just human… He’s no Rake or Slender Man… Just stay calm and you’ll stay alive… Just human… Just human…
He ducked my strike and managed to open up a large slash up my right forearm. I hissed and made another swing, this time attempting to bring it down on his head. I weaved right swiping at my face. I was lucky enough to tilt my head back and watch the blade slice the air only inches before me. I was suddenly knocked off kilter as his shin met my gut with a surprising amount of force. My left shoulder was then set ablaze with an orchestra of pain so potent, I was surprised I hadn’t passed out. Still, the bat found its target: his kneecap. We were level now… With a harsh jerk, he extracted the blade, his eerie grin maintaining. I gave a shriek, just as I imagine he wanted me to… Another swing of my bat met his ribs, causing him to bend over even more, his cheek almost to the floor. I knew if I was going to finish it, now was my chance. I lunged, making to smash the heavy end of my weapon into his upturned temple.

My ears were ringing… I couldn’t move… My jaw had dropped… I felt warm fluid spewing from my stomach… I had just been skewered… Jeff’s face was inches from my own… He was waiting… Waiting for that spark to leave my eyes…

NOW!
“Go to sleep…” I muttered.

It was then that I made my decisive move… With the strength I had left, I took hold of his collar and lunged forward. My mouth was soon filled with a very unpleasant metallic taste… I pulled back, taking with me as much as I could fit within my clenched jaw. It tore away… All of it… The meat of one’s throat is quite tough, I must say…My door flew open just as I let the black of unconsciousness take me…

It was over…

I had just killed the Killer…

It's a miracle and a glory and the greatest thing to ever happen, so they say, and it'll probably become the law soon that you have to take it. They'll have you swallow a little capsule when you're still a baby; probably at the same time you're getting your inoculations. The piece of the thing in there weighs only a few grams and will be plucked out of a little pool that will probably be installed in every hospital soon.

Those couple grams are more than enough for it to happen. Sure, you'll never get cancer. You'll live until a hundred and fifty. You'll have stronger bones and a more resilient immune system. You'll probably never need glasses or a hearing aid. If you lose something small like a finger, in half a year you'll have it back. If you lose a whole arm, in two years you'll have it back with nearly full functionality. It's the sort of miracle that's believable enough to catch on. It won't solve all our problems, and it'll even create a few more. Like overpopulation like we'd never saw coming. But it works and it's cheap and it's plentiful and that's all we need. Sure they can't quite explain how the thing actually manages to rewrite our genetic code after we swallow a few grams; but they promise the answers will come someday and that there are no ill side effects.

It's from a 'previously unknown variety of starfish; but they won't even tell you that on the news. I think the story right now is that it's something they're growing artificially. These starfish live in the deepest, darkest places in the ocean and they aren't very big or interesting looking. Honestly, we've probably seen them down there before a thousand times and just looked them over. It just so happened that prick with the show about eating weird foods got ahold of one, god knows how, and thought it was a different kind of starfish and ate part of it and a year later he had that foot he lost back. I'm sure they tore apart his house and tested gallons of his blood and interrogated everyone he ever spoke to, but somehow they figured out just when the regeneration happened and eventually found the fucking thing. It had been alive when he ate one of its arms and I guess he took a pity on it and let the thing live in a tank in his house. Well, this led to that and eventually they brought up a ton of the suckers.

But here's the thing. Think about or technology and innovations; think about what they're for. Mostly it's to keep us alive longer, make us healthier, help us communicate better. What if, as a race, we'd already had the ability to communicate via thought? What if we were naturally incredibly hardy and long-lived? What if we started out having everything we needed without having to do a bit of work? Our goals would turn to keeping our world the way it was and simply enjoying things. With a mind so powerful it can transmit and receive thoughts with no effort, it stands to reason other amazing things are possible too. With that mind staying completely intact in even the smallest sliver of the creature, one has to wonder just what else that mind can do..

So now here's the question. If you'd survived all this time just sitting around on the bottom of the ocean with this incredible intellect, how would you amuse yourself? What if that mind can wander and roam freely if it can just find something to carry it? What if as a race we made ourselves the bottom of the food chain just to ensure we'd constantly be taken into new creatures and allowed to see the world through their eyes? Is it really such a leap to think that such powerful minds could overtake smaller, lesser ones? No. Nor is it unusual to think that if such a race of powerful minds was endangered; they would use this ability to dominate the minds to defend themselves. That they'd patiently wait until their enemies devoured them, then simply displace the minds of those enemies and solve the conflict? I don't think it's crazy at all, and I don't think it's crazy that there's suddenly a lot more war all over the world. A lot research put into birth control and the 'accidental' release of that superbug that makes men sterile. We should be enjoying world peace but instead we're killing each other faster than ever before.

Maybe they're not even threatened, maybe we're just a game to them. Maybe we're the hundredth race of beings these things have done this with. All I know is they don't turn you into some zombie from a cheesey old sci-fi flick...they let you think you're still in control; that what they want you to do is actually what you want to do. It all seems so natural, so right. Then we're in World War III and the only thing the bombs won't scorch clean is the floor of the ocean.

Don't ask me how I know all of this, and don't take that pill.

1319571970.0,13,self.creepypasta,lortm,A Russian Winter,Juggernog,16,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/lortm/a_russian_winter/,"It was an old rumour amongst Russians that during their harshest winters were dangerous in more ways than the cold. A Russian scientist, Viktor Revok, had once experimented with the human body’s reaction to the crippling cold. His experiments had consisted of sending out German Prisoners of War into the snow in the bitter night, and observing them – to see their reactions, if any. Some tried to run – there were no foreseeable barriers preventing those send out from attempting to return to civilisation - but others stood still, paralysed by the cold. The scientists would nearly always find their bodies under piles of snow in the morning, frozen in position.

These experiments went on for three years, starting in early 1946 and ending in late 1949, until Viktor himself decided to participate in his own experiment, convinced that Russians were more resistant to the cold than Germans were. He had his scientists lock him outside his own facility, in the same region as the German prisoners, and in the same timeframe – and roughly the same snowy conditions. Viktor had a heart monitor attached to him before he left, so that the scientists could observe the effects of the cold on his body in that way. He had never expected to be killed by his own experiment.

In the end his body appeared to just give up fighting the cold and his heart rate slowed and stopped. The scientists watching the heart rate monitor were overwhelmed with grief, having lost the laboratories leader. Nonetheless, they couldn’t leave the frozen corpse buried under the snow, ready for some oblivious child or curious, lost tourist to find. The thing was, they searched for the body for three days, before finally giving up – declaring the body ‘lost’ and searching for a new lead scientist. The laboratory closed down soon afterwards, the team unable to find a new lead scientist.

Two years on, a Russian man went missing, and after three days, authorities found him, frozen in position, deep under the snow. The cause of death was unapparent, although curiously not caused by the freezing cold. The man had no reason to want to kill himself; nor any motive to go out into the harsh winter. Top investigators were baffled by the man’s mysterious death. It wasn’t until they looked through his possessions that they noticed something remotely out of the ordinary.

The man had kept an audio diary, to which he regularly recorded to throughout the day. The appropriate authorities investigated the tapes for anything that may have led to his death. They listened through over an hour of footage, and were close to giving up, and then the first odd recording began. The recording device was missing, but it was obviously portable, seen as the audio logs seemed to be recorded from different places, judging by the amount of ambient noise prevalent in each of the recordings. The former self of the man found frozen in the snow began to speak.

“The time is 6:45pm, and the snow is falling heavily. The temperature is slowly dropping, I may light a fire sometime soon, to ward off the cold” the man spoke, and then a pause, the device was still recording, but the man had stopped talking. After about ten seconds to man began to speak again “There is a man staring at me through my window” another pause, briefer this time, lasting for only about three seconds. “He looks inhuman, dead to the world, and cold.” His voice shivered “Oh so cold”.

For the next five minutes the tape consisted of the man reasoning with himself on whether or not he should allow the mysterious man into his home, due to the intensity of the cold outside. After a fair amount of deliberation and a large volume of contrasting opinions, the man decides to let the mysterious person standing outside his home, staring at him through the window, into his home. He remarks to himself over the tape “I just hope this doesn’t turn out to be the worst mistake I ever make”.

The tape stops here, moving onto the next entry.

“The time is 7:54pm, I have allowed to man standing outside into my home. He doesn’t speak, he just stares with  look of uncertainty – a look of uncertain intensity, with his never-warming cold, winter-blue eyes. I feel dead when he looks at me, I’ll tell the truth, I’m more than just a little anxious.” The tape stops and moves on again.

“The time is 8…” the man stammers, potentially checking a clock for a precise time “…42pm. The man has begun to walk out in the cold, and I can’t convince him to get back inside. I’m glad, as I wasn’t fond of his presence particularly, but I can’t allow him to go into the cold alone, I wouldn’t wish harm upon the man.” There is a brief pause “Oh, and he says his name is Viktor.”

From this point onwards, there is only the sound of a lock being turned, clicking towards the door being sealed. This suggests that the man – the victim – had left his tape recorder indoors. The background ambience, the whistle of the continuous cold wind, continues until the end of the tape has been reached, where the end of the recording is signified with a click. An emphasised full stop, or, rather, a question mark. So much remained unconfirmed. They assumed that Viktor was the assailant.

~

The next year, on the same day and at roughly the same time as the beginning of the notable recordings, a telephone call to the police station was recorded. The report was incredibly similar, and the outcome was identical, the body of a middle-aged woman was found buried under snow, frozen stiff in position. It became apparent that the encounter followed the same structure as the previous man. However, there was one difference, that added a second question mark to the unpunctuated line of confusion. The women on the phone said that the man’s face, whom he later put to the name of ‘Viktor’, was decaying, with notable pieces of flesh dangling, about to fall, and some that had already fallen.

The authorities never caught the man, and they still haven’t. The name and nature of the encounters matched the name up to being ‘Viktor Revok’, a scientist not long after the ending of World War 2, whose heart had stopped after spending one hour and fifty seven minutes in the snow, and whose body had never been found.

These attacks continue on the same day of the year, at the same time, in the same weather – every year to this day. Every time that the encounter is recorded, and this is not every time, the description of the man’s face and features indicates that he becomes more decayed, and that despite of his appearance, every year that person will open the door for that man, and the events of the previous year will repeat, with no foreseeable end – and with the evidence lying buried in the snow.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_lortm,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/lortm/a_russian_winter/,

I suppose I should provide some background information first. I’m a sophomore in a fairly good university in Boston – no, not MIT or Harvard, but still one that’s a bit of a chore to get into. My freshman year, I had the option to live in honors housing and decided to roll with it; after all, at least the people would be interesting. Whatever arcane algorithm they use to process roommate requests took in my preferences and spat out the name of my future roommate: Mike, just another random honors kid from St. Louis. The two of us got along fine for most of freshman year – my enjoyment of Miley Cyrus notwithstanding-and so we decided to room together sophomore year as well.

Now, Mike had always been a pretty obsessive guy. He tended to bounce around in his interests; one week, he would devour entire series of anime, only to later start watching random online episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and then begin working his way through the archives of the hottest new webcomic. And, of course, like any real obsessive, he would keep me posted on his latest craze. I humored him; what else are roommates for?

One day earlier this week, he started telling me random scary stories. You know, those random things you find on message boards-I think his main source ended up being some site called “creepypasta” (I never understood why pasta could be creepy, but whatever). I’d hear about a med student eating an arm, or someone being autopsied alive, or some random youtube video that will drive you insane. We usually had a good laugh about them.

The third day of this obsession, however, things got weird. He threw a few more stories my way before hitting the sack, but something seemed a little off. His voice had a sharp edge to it. As the hour got later, his banter got more and more inane, as though he were talking just to stave off having to go to sleep. Eventually, I pointedly got into my bed and rolled over, effectively ending any further chance at conversation. I wish I hadn’t.

I sleep like a log, and that night was no exception. I don’t think I even came close to waking. Usually I can’t remember any of my dreams, but the nightmare I had that night has been clear in my mind for days now. I dreamt I was trapped in a fog so dense I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. The damp air sent chills down my spine. I could hear muffled screams in the distance. There didn’t seem to be any words, just guttural shrieks of pain. Instantly (don’t ask me how), I recognized the screams as Mike’s. I tried my best to run to him, but my feet just slid through the fog; I couldn’t get any real traction on the ground, if there indeed was any ground. The screams got further away and more indistinct, though I could still tell they were Mike’s. Eventually, they faded to nothing and I woke up.

And every last trace of Mike was gone from the room.

Everything. His laptop, his sheets, the “Official Zombie Survival” guide poster on the wall, the heap of trash he let accumulate on his half of the windowsill-everything. A thick layer of dust coated his entire side of the room. Absolutely nothing on my side of the room had been touched-nor had any of his stuff in the bathroom, the kitchen, or the living room of our suite. Only in the bedroom had anything been taken.

I couldn’t believe it. I prayed it was a dream. I pinched my elbow until the skin was red, until my fingernails drew blood. When I didn’t wake up, I dialed campus security, who quickly brought in the Boston Police Department. I was immediately kicked out of the room so they could go over everything with a fine-toothed comb.

I think I must have been in shock. I felt completely numb, like nothing around me really mattered. I’d left my laptop out in our suite’s common room, so I used that to distract myself-or to try to, at any rate. When I popped open the laptop, however, a word document stared at me. Its text was the following:

‘I know this is stupid. I can’t help but think how much I’ll regret this in the morning, but for some reason I’m genuinely scared and I feel like this is the only way I can tell someone why. So here goes: earlier, I was scouring the ‘net for short horror stories-you know, rituals, tales of scary places, and the like. I came across this…warning, I guess it was. I won’t say what, and I won’t say where, for fear of you finding it yourself. Suffice it to say it sent chills down my spine, something not much has managed to do. Still, as has become my habit, I just clicked on the next hyperlink, going ever farther down the rabbit hole.

The warning stayed with me, though. In the back of my head, just nibbling away, waiting until I would focus on something else to rear its ugly head. This was irrational, I knew; my mind was just playing tricks on me. Some ancestral fear had been played upon, some age-old nightmare that was just that-a nightmare, no more and no less. But that didn’t make the fear go away. Only when I looked at the clock to see how long I had until you got back that it dawned on me I had passed the time alloted me by the warning to stop what was coming (any vagueness is out of concern for you, I promise).

And then the real anxiety kicked in. My palms started to sweat, and my eyes refused to stay closed for more than a second at a time. All my hairs stood on end, and I could feel my heart rate start to increase. Instantly, I knew that the warning had been real. And I had failed to heed it. My time was limited.

It was about then that you got back from the TV station. I was so glad to see someone else, I can’t imagine how I sounded. Finally, someone to fight off the dark with, a companion against the now terrifying night. But clearly you weren’t interested; your yawns were a dead giveaway. You headed to bed, and I (to stave off sleep a little longer) decided to write you this. Do me a favor – if I’m wrong, forget this ever happened. If I’m right…warn them.’

So that’s what I’m doing. I’m warning you. Just be careful. Next time you go on an archive binge at creepypasta, or start checking the horror thread of your favorite discussion board, or even just try googling “creepy stories,” if you feel a chill run down your spine at some warning you’ve never read before you might want to heed it. If you decide not to, however – if you just click on your merry way-please tell Mike I’m sorry I couldn’t get to him in the fog.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_hv46v,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/hv46v/a_warning/,

I’ve built a wall. At least, I think I built this wall. It’s kept the thing from getting to me, but I don’t know for how long. It’s smashing every ounce of its weight into the wall over and over and over. It’s enormous, it has to be. The force it’s generating is knocking loose small bits from the wall. No human could do that. I can’t remember when I built it, or how long it took. My sense of time is gone. It must of taken weeks, month, or even years! The wall is massive. I think it’s made from stone, but I can’t tell. The light in this room is very faint, and seems to be coming from no source that I can see. The light only touches the wall and myself. Not the ground beneath it, or the roof above it. The wall appears to go on and on infinitely. I couldn’t have built it, but somehow I know I did. I need to know how I got here. What I did to deserve this! Why, whatever this creature is, chose to torment me! WHY IS IT IS SO HARD TO REMEMBER!?

Okay, just calm down, you can figure this out. Let’s start from the beginning. What’s the first thing you remember?

Just fragments of the day, but is this even the same day that lead me to this Hell? There’s a thought, I could be in Hell.

Fuck.

Okay, let’s not freak out, that won’t help anyone. I must be going crazy. I’m talking to myself, FUCK I’M ANSWERING MYSELF!

Okay, I don’t have time to self analyze, it’s still knocking off pieces of the wall. I can recall images of putting on clothes this morning. I see myself eating a Pop Tart on the way to my morning class. It’s a Calculus, and I remember every hour and a half of it. This actually might be Hell.

SHIT! It just broke off part of the wall! This is the first I can see through to the other side. It’s a very small hole, just big enough for me to make out a vast shadow moving beyond my sanctuary. It’s holding for now, but it won’t keep the thing out. Not forever.
I have a vivid memory of the hour and a half drive to work. I also remember that I work at a haunted house, but I can only remember its nickname. We called it the Edge, but what was that short for? Edge of Darkness? Edge of Terror? Edge of Sanity? NO! It was the Edge of Madness! YES! That’s it!

Over and over and OVER! The thing just keeps throwing itself into the wall. Knocking tiny pieces here and there, but nothing more. My wall is holding strong.

I’m recalling a crystal clear memory of putting on my make-up. I wore a full facial prosthetic that made my face look like a demonic boar. I attached it using a product called spirit gum. Basically, I glued a soft latex mask to my face with something similar to super glue. I did this because it allowed the boar face to move like my own. I painted my skin a pale brownish pink, the pig nose a pale pink, and the large tusks jutting from my lower jaw white with blood spots. I then added highlights and shadows to the low hanging brow that furrowed angrily in the middle. I held my eyelids open and inserted contacts that made my eyes completely white except for a tiny circle in the middle to see through. I put on a black trench coat with lots of metal pieces hanging from it in a uniform pattern, and finally slicked my hair back and out of the way. To complete my ensemble, I picked up my chainsaw. It had no chain of course, but that has never stopped anyone from expelling bodily fluid. Actually, solids too now that I think about it. While disgusting, this is incredibly gratifying to any “haunter.”
I’m indiscriminate of sex, age, or race when it comes to scaring guests. My philosophy; you just paid money to be scared, and you’re in luck because I’m very good at my job. I’ve done this for over a decade, I kn..
OH GOD! IT JUST KNOCKED OUT A MUCH LARGER PIECE OF THE WALL!!! There is now a hole as big as my fist at about chest height. I’m looking through, but still can see only a too large shadow. It’s breathing heavy. No, wait, it’s not breathing it’s laughing! It’s laughing at me! THAT MOTHERFUCKER IS LAUGHING AT ME! The deep husky guttural laughter is mocking me in my turmoil. I can still only see a large shadow in the distance. It’s faint, but now getting closer. Quickly getting closer!

SHIT!

The impact sends me sprawling backwards. Damn, that was stupid. I’m dazed but otherwise OK. I did catch a glimpse of what looked like a set of horns.

I need to think and remember more quickly. I don’t know how much time I’ve got left. Something major happened that night. I definitely scared a chick I thought was hot. Her fight or flight reflexes kicked in, and I took a fist to the groin. That’s not anything new, it happens all the time. I’m usually careful to guard between my legs, but she was particularly quick. OH! I was tasked with showing a duo of paranormal researchers around the park. I felt them being there was odd. Sure, first year haunters might freak out sometime because they think they saw something. With time everyone builds a tolerance to fear. They introduce themselves as Stacy and Clair, and they were HOT! Also, something else odd, they both were flirting with me. Like, odd touches here and there, or awkward sexual innuendos. Flirting with a guy who looks like bondage boar demon with a chainsaw is kind of odd don’t you think? Clair told me “we love coming to haunts, we get the most action here.” Naturally, my mind quickly produced an inappropriate thought that was difficult to suppress. Stacy said “Our theory is that the large concentration of intense emotions such as dread, fear, and even laughter draws entities like a beacon.” It’s inhuman impacts are spreading out in frequency. Though, they seem much harder and are rattling my teeth. He’s going to get through, any moment. I need to skip through the tour. I’ve already wasted too much time on details! COME ON THINK!

I’ve lead them behind one of the haunts. I’m showed them the secret actor doors that allow them to get to break areas without running into guests. They both continued to flirt with me. I was blushing like crazy! They can’t see it due to the glued on boar face! Ha! Seriously though, why the fuck are they flirting with me without ever having seen my face? Suddenly Stacy approached me and locked me in a kiss. Instinctively, I obliged her..

WHAT THE HELL? I JUST BLACKED OUT??? The memories just end! There’s nothing after that!

It’s laughing again, like it can read my mind or something. I brace for the next impact and two very large pieces fall to the floor from the middle of the wall. I stare in horror as the creature leans down to look through. MY GOD! It’s very similar to a boar’s face, my boar’s face! Only, it’s enormous and covered in a thin fur. There’s drool falling from its lips that are turned up into what looks like a grin. What I previously thought were horns are actually the enormous tusks jutting from its jaw to its forehead, and ending at a needle tipped points just under its eyes. ITS EYES! They are completely white, and enormous with no pupil what so ever. It projects that awful laugh again. It stops and holds it’s eyes directly at mine.

“YOU MUST WATCH.”

Honestly, now I prefer the laugh. Its voice is much more terrifying. Sounding like three creatures speaking on slightly different extremely low pitches. He steps to the side and points straight ahead to what looks like a giant TV screen. Light pours through it showing an image. It’s from the point of view of someone laying down, and looking up at the night sky. The screen goes in and out, like someone blinking. Two heads come into view looking down at the screen. It’s Stacy and Clair with maniacal smiles on their faces. The person’s right hand comes in from the bottom of the screen, turning it over as if trying it out for the first time. Wait! That’s my hand! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?? IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

“IT IS YOU, OR RATHER YOUR BODY.”

Wait! What are talking about?

“Are you there my Lord?” Clair is looking straight into the screen. The boar thing turns towards the screen.

“YES, YOU DID WELL. I FOUND THIS ONE WITH EASE.”

This time, I heard another voice along with his. It sounded just like mine. He must be speaking to them through my body. Stacy leans toward the screen “My idea worked! We used someone who looked similar to you to make the ritual more powerful.” I can’t believe this is happening! What the fuck is this crazy bitch talking about? Ritual? What Ritual?

“THIS ONE IS CONFUSED, HE IS WATCHING, ENLIGHTEN HIM.”

“With pleasure my Lord!” Clair straddles my stomach, and leans forward to hover inches from my face. “You see, we used you. Not in the way you hoped I’m afraid.” Stacy lays across my chest in front of Clair and says “We’ve been trying to find the right body to bring The Lord to this world.” Clair strokes her fingers through Stacy’s hair, and begins to roll her hips on my chest as she says, “We’ve gone through so many, but none of them were as perfect as you.”

I yell with all my might, BUT WHY??? WHY DO THIS????
Again, I hear his three pitched voice along with my own.

“HE BELIEVES YOU CAN HEAR HIM.”

He starts that hideous laughter again, and looks back to me. “YOUR BODY NO LONGER BELONGS TO YOU.""

He looks back to the screen. ""TELL HIM WHY.”

Stacy runs her finger tips slowly around my mouth. “We are his. We belong to him and no one else. We need him to walk the Earth again as he once did. We found your pictures on the haunts website.” Clair moves her left hand across Stacy’s side and says “When I saw them I noticed how similar you look to our Lord. I just knew he would have no trouble finding you. He now has an Earthly body.” Clair licks her lips and stretches them into an impossibly deep smile and says “Your body.” I see my hand move up to touch her and stroke her face softly.

“THERE IS JUST ONE THING YOU DID INCORRECTLY”

Clair and Stacy both freeze with a look of terror.

“YOU’VE CHOSEN SOMEONE WHO CAN THROW UP A BARRIER STRONGER THAN ANY IVE SEEN. THE POSSESSION IS ONLY COMPLETED WHEN THE BODIES OWNER COMPLETELY SUBMITS TO FEAR.”

I must say, I can’t help but smirk just a little.

“YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME SOMEONE WHO PUTS A WALL IN FRONT OF FEAR.” He makes my voice along with his, grow louder than I have ever been capable. “YOU HAVE FAILED!!”

Without warning my hand moves to Clair’s neck with lighting quickness. I hear a loud snap as her head twists almost completely around. She falls to the ground as Stacy looks on in shock.

“YOU ARE SPARED, DO NOT FAIL ME AGAIN. DO NOT LET ANYONE DISTURB ME. I MUST DESTROY HIS WILL AND HIS WALL.”

I feel a growing renewed determination. I have spent over a decade building this wall to block fear. THIS ASSHOLE WILL NOT GET THROUGH!

He unleashes his deep taunting laugh again. “WE SHALL SEE.” Then charges my wall again, over and over and over.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1kgm7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kgm7v/locked_in_behind_the_wall/,

It had been this way for 3 years - since her 13th birthday. She claimed at the time that she wanted to have a more ""boyish"" color. Something that would set her apart from all the girls in her class. The only remnants of her youthful pink-and-purple phase was a near empty plastic, magenta bookcase. It held no books. In it was one simply framed picture.

This picture of her childhood teddy bear was positioned so that the bear's eyes darted across the room to her bed. Margaret had always claimed it made her feel safer at night. She felt protected when the bear was watching over her.

But Margaret never slept. Instead, even at 16, she spent the whole night wondering what crept in the darkness surrounding her. She had gotten used to passing off her lack of sleep as insomnia. Over time, her eyes grew sunken and dark, and her irritability began to concern her family. Margaret shrugged them off, saying that she was just having trouble falling asleep because of school-related stress. It would get better as time went on and she got used to her workload.
Months like this went by, and Margaret still could not sleep. She lost weight, lost friends, and withdrew more and more from the outside world. She even started to keep a knife under her pillow. ""Just in case,"" she always thought. Eventually, it had to catch up to her. Eventually she had to sleep.

She did.

When she awoke, she saw a shadowy figure moving towards her in the dark. She only caught a faint glimpse of the humanoid shape, but felt that something was off. Were her eyes merely playing tricks on her? No... something was moving closer.

Margaret cowered into the corner of her bed as the figure moved closer. She heard a low whisper that was almost unintelligible but sounded almost as if the creature was speaking her name.

The figure reached an arm over the bed, towards the girl, quivering. Margaret grasped her hand on the knife she kept hidden, and as the figure's hand touched Margaret's shoulder, she lunged out with the knife, stabbing the creature in the neck. The figure fell onto the bed, it's blood drenched neck soaking Margaret's feet.

Margaret raced off her bed, toward the light switch on the opposite side of the room. When the light turned on, Margaret immediately broke down in tears. The bloody figure draped over her bed was not a monster, but her father, carrying a pile of paint swatches. He had hoped to suggest a new, more comforting color to her room.

With the adrenaline still pumping through her body, Margaret fell to the floor, hoping her heart would stop beating with such relentless force. Within moments, she had passed out on her floor, feet covered in blood, facing her dead father's body on her bed.

She awoke an hour later, only to spot her father's body missing, and no signs of blood on her or the bed. Assuming it was merely a bad dream, she went to climb back into bed. She looked towards the picture of her favorite bear, hoping it would comfort her and relax her from the nightmare she just woke from.

Something seemed strange about the picture, though. The bear had been completely brown, but now... now his paws were covered in crimson red.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1k2c5q,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k2c5q/painted_blue/,

*Original of: /u/ rebelpoet2273

-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is said that there are three ways that fear expresses itself: through physical reaction, paranoia, and dread. And that while physical gut reactions—the fight or flight response so often called upon— can be startling for a short time, for real terror to shine through you need the latter two, especially paranoia. You know the feeling right? Actually, let me clarify: you do know the feeling, you can recall it perfectly... 

Work has been hard today, you need to relax. Your friends have been going through break-up pains and hearing their stories is starting to take a toll on you too. You just finished a chapter in your new book and you start to feel tired. Deciding to head towards bed, with stomach sated and bladder emptied, you climb the stairs towards the comfort of a nice warm slumber. You reach the door of the bedroom and make sure everything is in order before turning out the lights. You walk to the bed, its loving grasp beckoning like an old friend. The comforter and top sheet peel away revealing a warm layer that fits snugly around your tired body. Closing your eyes, you start to drift off. Then you hear it: something. A scurry? A scratch? 

It’s just rats, you rationalize, the exterminator told me I had a rodent problem, why didn’t I pay the extra money for the rat poison? But somewhere deep in your mind you know this is no rat, you pull the warm blankets up to your face. You sit trying to talk yourself out of this childish fear of the dark. See it’s nothing I knew it, the grown-up in you smirks to your inner child, you got all worked up over some fat mouse. You lay back down confident of your power and dominion over your little living space. I need to stop staying up so late, you start to laugh, Ha—, but, then you’re interrupted.

You hear a bang on a door. Your door?  A car door down the block? You wait drifting further and further beneath the covers that you hope will keep you safe as you wait, not wanting to hear another sound. But still you find yourself straining against the cotton trying to pick something up. Anything. After an apparently predetermined waiting period, you decide it is safe to hazard a look. Nothing here, you observe. 

You reach for your bedside stand, scrambling around, knocking the stack of half-finished books you’ve been reading to the floor with a definitive thud. Where’s a flashlight, where’s a flashlight? You grope the drawers to no avail. You straighten up; legs rigid and unyielding paralyzed by fear. Still you manage to twist your body and lower your legs to the solid floor. The material feels cool to the touch. And as your spine extends to its full height, you can almost hear the creaking in now solidified joints. You stand up, your senses beginning to go into hyper vigilance as you hazard your first step across the floor. You step to the foot of your bed, wary of your surroundings as if you have never been in this room before.

You close the closet door because you can feel it watching you from the darkness behind your slightly crumpled shirts hanging in a row. It? You wonder what you mean it. How do you know it, is in fact an it? It implies something against nature, something less than human.  

You throw the curtains open and look out the window, out into the darkness. Something doesn’t seem right, you jump. Since when did the house across the street have a face on its gate, you wonder, but you realize it doesn’t. It’s just your brain making faces where there are none… causing you to fabricate monsters lurking in the dark. What do they call that? You know this; you got an ‘A’ on that quiz in Psych. It’s the same phenomenon that causes people to see Jesus on their toast and the Elvis in their toilet bowl.

Pareidolia, that’s it, you remember impressed by your ability to recall a fact from a class that you only stayed in for some hipster chick who sat in front of you. She did have the nicest ass. 

You shake your head of the callipygian goddess and as you glance around the darkness of the room, your mind jumps to childhood memories of monsters under your bed. You start to think about checking under there just to be sure. But, then you remember that the space under your bed is crammed with packing boxes— no room for any monsters there. Maybe the child in your subconscious made sure to put them there in case of such a night. 
With your room now apparently safe from threats, you acknowledge that you will have to check beyond the confines of your miniature abode. You reach for the trusty aluminum bat leaning against your door frame as you grope for the light switch. 

“Hey motherfucker if you’re out there I’m armed, I’ll kill you” you yell as you throw open your bedroom door. You slowly creep down the hall wary of the bathroom door you left open. As you reach the crown molding, you swing around into the bathroom and jump back at the monster staring at you in the mirror. But upon closer inspection you realize it’s just your reflection…right? It’s just your brain calling ‘bullshit’ on any claims of bravado knowing full well you’re too big of a pussy to act on anything you threaten. 

“Hello, I know you’re there.” Your voice quivers. Shit, you think, that sounded pathetic. You walk further down the hall, arm still cocked back at the ready.  You reach the change in flooring the boards giving way under your weight, moaning and creaking like the monster you’re determined to find. 

Brrreeep. You jump out of your skin, looking around frantically just to see that your pocket has lit up. It was nothing more than your phone, you smirk pulling it out to check what status update or urgent text message has given you such a start. But, it seems the harsh noise was your phone’s death cry as the screen turns to black. The only light in the corridor now the flashing pinpoint of red emanating from your phone’s plastic cover. Damn, you think trying to remember where you left that charger.  

You creep farther and farther down the hall, seeing the silhouette of your couch against the darkened backdrop of your living room décor. You see movement out of the corner of your eye.

“Ah hah,” you scream, turning around quick as lightning. 

“Meow,” it’s just the damn cat almost gave me a heart attack; you told your ex you didn’t want that stupid cat. Yet, here you are still feeding it and keeping it alive over a year after the fact. You really need to man up, grow a pair, you think making a mental note. 

This is ridiculous you plead I’m a rational human being not some loony nut job. But the curiosity in you is just determined to kill the cat. And was that a pair of eyes staring at you from above the fridge? 

You trip over a dumbbell that your friend left lying on the floor, sweet Lord that hurts. You hiss sharply inhaling the metallic scent of the blood on your freshly stubbed toe. You flick on every light switch you can find. Was that a hand that just brushed against your neck? You look around panicked to find that you turned on the ceiling fan without realizing, and slowly oxygen starts to return to your lungs.

Your process is slow but steady as you try to “clear” every room in the house before willing to give up the late night goose chase. You check room after room, turning on light after light, until reaching the front door. You suddenly feel self-conscious, my neighbors must think I’m nuts lighting up the whole street at this hour. And even though the front door is locked you decide to poke your head outside just to make extra sure. Satisfied that there appears to be no abomination prowling the curb, you retreat back inside.

You lock the front door; double, even triple checking the bolt. You walk through the house checking every 
access to the outdoors, verifying that the house is effectively sealed, planning out an intricate route of closing doors and turning off lights so that you never fall in darkness. Eventually, you’ve made enough progress to be within an arm’s reach of the bedroom’s dazzling light. 

You hurry in and lock the bedroom door knowing that the house is clear, that it was nothing more than imagination catching up with you at such a late hour. They do always say that the imagination is the scariest horror movie. You survey the room, everything looks fine: the sheets lay the way you left them, the window curtains are drawn shut, you can see that all the clothes hanging in the closet are in order. So you turn out the lights and climb into bed clamoring back to the safety found under covers. 

And it’s only as the lights flicker out that you remember that you closed the closet door…

I never thought that such an innocent thing could be so bad.. It all started a few weeks ago. I was going away for the weekend with my mother just to get a break from it all, we decided to take the bus in order to save some money, we had many bags so the bus driver offered to put the bags in the bottom compartment of the bus. We thanked him and sat in our seats. As we started to drive off. My mother said to me "" I don't remember seeing him close the compartment door, I really hope he did it would suck if we lost our bags."" I chuckled slightly and replied ""mother of course he closed the door, he would have to be a fool not to"" she agreed with me and then began talking about other things. When we finally reached our destination we hopped out of the bus and went to the side where the compartment was to get our bags when we noticed that the door was already open. This meant that the bus driver had left the door open throughout the entire journey. ""god dammit! Help me look to see if any bags went missing"" I sighed. My mother and I counted the bags, the only thing that was gone was my purse which wasn't that big of a deal considering the only things that were in it was my expired student I.D card and a few business cards that had my phone number on it. ""At least you have your number in the bag, so that if anyone finds it they can call you."" my mother said trying to reassure me. I agreed with her and we continued on to our hotel room. A few hours after we got settled into our room I got a phone call from an unknown number. It must be the person who found my bag i thought and quickly answered it. ""Hello?"" I said waiting for a response. There was no answer on the other end, only some faint breathing. ""Who is this?"" I said in a slightly more assertive tone. Before I could say anymore I heard a womans scream, then I heard the person on the other end hang up. I hung up and sat on the bed, thoughts flooding my mind. ""Who was on the phone?"" my mother asked. ""I have no clue, all I heard was some breathing and then a scream."" I muttered. ""It was probably just one of your friends playing a silly prank on you"" she said.
""Yeah maybe, Anyways its late, we should get some sleep."" I yawned. She agreed so we got into our beds and went to sleep. I tossed and turned all night, terrible thoughts and images of who or what called me in my mind. I almost got to sleep when I heard a loud banging at the hotel room door. I sprang up in bed and quickly went to see who it was. I looked through the peep hole and saw no one, I opened the door and looked to see if anyone was there, and still no one was around. I sighed and went back into the room forgetting to lock the door behind me. I got back into bed and tried to rest for at least an hour before I had to get up. When I opened my eyes I saw my mother's bed covered in blood. I quickly ran over to her bed and pulled the covers off. And what I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life. In the bed I saw the dismembered corpse of my mother, I screamed and nearly vomited from the sight. I turned to grab the phone to call 911 and saw my missing purse on the table. I looked in the purse and saw a heart, the heart of my mother on top of the heart there was a small note saying ""I decided to return your purse, just thought it was right thing to do. Thanks for leaving the door unlocked, it made my job so much easier. Sincerely yours, The good samaritan ""

It was only ever supposed to be a walk home

But on that night

It happened

I lived in Cumberland, Maine. I was probably 11 at the time when one night I was walking past Henry's house after making a night run to the store at the end of our block. The store was probably only 7 or 8 doors down from my house. I ran there just to get some milk for the next mornings breakfast. On my way back I passed by my friend Henry's house which behind his backyard was the woods. They weren't exactly the most frightening woods ever but they gave out a certain chill. 

I remember that we would always play there during the daytime. It would only usually last from 11:00 to 1:00. After 1:00 the woods wasn't the best place to be, considering the fact that we were both afraid of ""it"". We never talked about ""it"" but we knew it was there. The weird part is we could never recall it's facial features or it's general details. Except for me, not after that night run.

When I was walking by after buying the milk I stopped for a second to just look into the woods. I don't know why but I couldn't control it. I just kinda stopped. I was only there for maybe 30 seconds.... Or god knows how long. It's actually hard to remember. I usually try not to think about that, it tends to give me a headache. To get back to it, I just stood there, looking into the dark abyss that inhabited those dreaded woods. I just stared at them.

But then I noticed ""it"". It was standing there. Right at the border of the moonlight and the dark woods. I froze. I didn't know what to do. If I ran it would have surely caught up to me. If I attacked it, I wouldn't have been probably able to lay a finger on it. It would probably tear me apart, literally. I didn't even want to look at it. It lacked detail to begin with, it was like a blank, black slate. It was grotesque to look at though, I felt nauseous even knowing about it. Just the thought of it in general was nauseating. I don't know how that could even happen though, it was just a black tall figure.

Well, to be precise, I can't really remember what it looked like. When I think about it it just seems to either be nothing or everything. The height of it though... It was only the size of a tall basketball player but.... It's height, it's fucking height seemed to stretch on until it reached the atmosphere.

But I didn't know what to do. I just stood there. I only stood there because I didn't know how to react. Not even anything I've seen on tv before could match those horrors. I only remember standing there for about 5 seconds, but it seems like to last for an eternity in my mind. Then everything went black. I woke up later in the middle of those woods. When I awoke, it was late dawn.  I was surrounded by the beautiful tall trees that made those woods. I honestly don't know where I was exactly, when i got up I looked around me. There was these trees, they weren't from around there though, because I remember going up and feeling the bark on the trees. 

They were Redwoods, what the hell are a bunch of Redwood trees doing across the states? I didn't really care much at the time, honestly I could've given two shits about the trees, because after touching the bark I had... I think I had blood on my hands, at first being at such a young age I thought ""Who's spilling ketchup all on these trees?"". Of course being 11 I tried finding a reasonable explanation to the ""ketchup"" on the trees, but I quickly decided to leave it be. 

Eventually, it kicked in. The fear. The fear of being alone, the fear of knowing that you had to defend yourself and no one to save the day. I freaked, I didn't know  what to do. I just ran, I only ran. I didn't even want to look back, knowing that ""it"" could be there. While I was running I saw a hole, it was pretty big. For some odd reason I stopped and examined it, it was a long drop I could tell, I couldn't see the bottom of it. I was only there for a few seconds when I heard some twigs snap behind me from where I came from, I looked back and saw something move behind a tree out of the corner of my eye. I didn't even question it. I booked it, I ran faster than I ever have, longer than I ever have. By that point I was probably the fastest in school.

As I was running I saw things in the corner of my eyes, they weren't trees, because they weren't stationary. They were moving, faster than I was. I still don't know what those were though. And I don't ever want to know. I also heard the voices and laughter of kids as I was running. The voices, they were calling my name. They wouldn't stop calling. I didn't know where it was coming from though, it was all around me. I didn't want to think about it.

Then I tripped. I didn't pay attention to the objects on the ground and only to the things in front of me. I felt a huge amount of pain and throbbing in my head. After I tripped I immediately looked up. I was home. Close at least. I wounded up on the side of Henry's house and next to his backyard. As I soon came to the realization that I made it, that I made it home. That thought soon changed. I felt something tug on the end of my jeans. It wasn't a tug though, it had a grip. I was being pulled back in. I scrambled to get up. I quickly ran to the sidewalk. And sitting right there was the gallon of milk I had purchased the night before. I grabbed it and ran. Thankfully, I eventually reached home.

Now, 12 years later, I live in Cincinnati, OH and have a nice steady job. I was reminded of my experience and decided to research it. I actually had to stay up all night getting to the bottom of this and call in sick for work  the next day. I recently found out that in that county in Cumberland, ME had tons of reports recalling missing kids. All of them were around my area and a few in my town too actually. About 17 kids went missing, and they were never found. But eventually in the years to follow around the time I was right in the middle of High-School they sent out a rescue team to find all these missing kids. They did find the kids though, but they were all deceased. Mangled and torn up. They found the bodies inside of a pit with a 10ft. drop. On one of the kids torsos they found what resembled satanic symbols. But weren't of that origin. Even though I found out about that pit I came across. It said nothing about the Redwoods being there.

I'm only writing this because I'm going on a major camping trip with a group of friends. I'm brining my .45 with me just in case anything happens. And to also worn you and anyone else about the dangers that could inhabit those woods. Just stay away from those woods. My friends are to ignorant to listen to what I have to say about them. I'm only going to protect them. Just for protection.

It all started with a picture my friend texted me. http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/All+hail+our+savior+and+leader.+Shrek+is+love+shrek+_013e3eeabaf949cb192b6a217ed821f5.jpg. It didn’t seem like anything bad at the time. Just another funny picture. I sent it to all of my other friends as well; soon enough we started sending more copies of that picture to everyone. Like dozens at a time. Still; it didn’t seem like anything bad.
	
Then my friend found this picture http://25.media.tumblr.com/4f9c90b09f6236c6525acf9966f6947e/tumblr_mgpp61iEL91qmg0kfo1_500.png When I first saw it, I was a little shocked, but humorously. The picture didn’t seem like anything bad either. Maybe a little dirty, but we had seen much more messed up stuff, so I didn’t think much of it.
	
Pretty soon, we began finding more Shrek pictures. We started sending the pictures to each other, dozens or even hundreds at a time. Eventually we began spamming each other; with anything we could find. Mostly Shrek.
	What happened next caused everything else to fall into play.
	
The same friend discovered that some people had set up an organization on the Internet.
	
That organization was called the Church of Shrek.
	
We all thought that this was hilarious. We began spreading even more Shrek pictures to each other. We began saying Shrek jokes and puns, notably “Shrek is love, Shrek is life” and “Check yourself before you Shrek yourself.” We wouldn’t say this in public mostly. Mostly we just said this to each other, or when trying to be funny. We didn’t think that there was anything wrong with it. We didn’t think that anything could happen just from saying Shrek jokes.
	
We didn’t think that anything would change.
	
Shrek started becoming more and more popular, more and more of our friends started saying Shrek jokes, more and more Shrek pictures were being sent.
	
But it all went ogre the line when the computers became involved.
	
When we weren’t in class, or supposed to be using class time to type something, we would go to the upper library to work. The upper library is a quiet place; there aren’t many teachers there, people didn’t often work there, and you could even play video games without being disturbed if you wanted.
	
The upper library also had computers.
	
On that fateful day, I thought it would be funny to change the desktop background of one of the computers  to this http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fqyjOc3EpT4/mqdefault.jpg
	
My friends and I all thought that this was hilarious. We started changing the desktop backgrounds whenever we could to funny pictures. One other notable picture used was this http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hf52YJtWdRs/mqdefault.jpg
	
Like the Shrek jokes, like the spamming, we started changing the desktop backgrounds of the computers to funny pictures. It seemed fairly innocent; I mean, the pictures were clean and they served as a small laugh to someone before they started on their essay; almost as motivation.
	
By this point we had nearly forgotten Shrek. Or so we thought.
	
About two weeks after I first changed the desktop background on one of the computers, I decided to go through all of my old pictures on my phone. Just for laughs; maybe I would stumble upon a meme I could show my friends or something.
	
Suddenly, a familiar picture of a green ogre with an abnormally long neck popped up on screen. 
	
It was Shrek, the very first Shrek picture I had been sent.
	
As I looked over at my computer sitting on my nearby desk, I realized what we had to do.
	
We had to spread it.
	
The word of Shrek.
	
The next day we started changing the desktop backgrounds, all of them at once, to Shrek. We would send forty copies of a Shrek picture to the printers; tape several of them around the room and leave the rest in the printer. We started saying Shrek jokes nonstop. Then my history teacher told our class to write a two-part essay, with the first part about how the Russians managed to keep their Orthodox religion throughout the Middle Ages, and the second part instructing us to create a fake religion and talk about how we would spread it.
	
My religion was, of course, the Church of Shrek. I wrote about how I would start of by spreading the stories of Shrek, entitled The Old Shrekstament and The New Shrekstament. Eventually, after gathering a fairly large group of followers (the Brogres), people would start hearing faint whispers saying, “It’s all ogre now.” Shrek would start murdering people in the middle of the night; a bloody onion as well as the words “He/she should have checked him/herself before he/she Shreked him/herself.” People would then start reporting seeing a large green figure escaping from a bedroom window. These Shrek sightings would increase in number until May 18, 2016. Exactly fifteen years after the first Shrek movie was released.
	
On that day, the Brogres and I would acquire guns and explosives from black market dealers. We would lay siege to Dreamworks Animation Studios and execute anyone inside. Any police or national guard who tried who came anywhere near the building would be shot on sight. This would be the climax of an event known as the Shrekoning.
	
After securing the building, we would build a shrine to Shrek.
	
That shrine would be constructed of onions dipped in human blood.
	
Our lord Shrek would recognize this offering and call down a storm of giant onions to destroy the Earth. All would die, but all Brogres would see Shrek riding a floating onion materialize in front of them before they died. Shrek would lead all of the faithful Brogres to his onion planet.
	
My teacher gave me an A+ on the essay.
	
We took this as a sign, a sign to spread the word of Shrek, to truly accept Shrek as love and life, and to worship Shrek as our lord.
	
Finally, though, it was ogre. It was Shrekmate, everything we had worked so hard for came crashing down.
	
We changed one more desktop background, unknowingly of full view of a teacher. The teacher scolded us for changing all of the backgrounds and for printing all of the Shrek pictures. The next assembly, an announcement was made reminding the students that the desktop backgrounds were not to be changed and that the printers were for work only.
	
The funny thing is that that last picture that I changed the desktop background to was the first Shrek picture I had ever received. That which started it also ended it.
	
Shrek is love, Shrek is life.

This is an OC Skyrim Pasta.


I was browsing a forum, looking for easter eggs Bethesda had put into the game. It was about 5:34 PM, and I was in a good  mood. I saw a post about bigfoot, a post about a surviving dwemer, and a post about an alien space ship. (All hoaxes) but then, something caught my eye. Something slightly believable. Apparently, if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty, without dying, six times in a row, without quitting out at all, when you started another new game, an NPC would spawn. This NPC was a Nord, clad in steel armor, who would spawn at a random spot in the game world every dawn, and wander that spot until dusk. His name was apparently Ryphjot, and he would give you a quest to defeat Alduin, at the throat of the world. However, he would only appear before you meet the Jarl of Whiterun. If you talk to the jarl of Whiterun, Ryphjot would never spawn again in the entire game, and you would have to beat it six times in a row, on the hardest difficulty, without quitting, all over again.


This seemed like a complete hoax to me. Why would the developers put something that obscure into the game? I would much rather go on the 'Bug-in-a-Jar' wild goose chase, than attempt this. I looked on youtube for any videos of him, and, sure enough, there were none. There were a bunch of comments on the post, calling bullshit as well. I quit out of Firefox, and began playing some Galactic Civilizations II.


When I went to bed that night, I didn't have any strange nightmares about Ryphjot, or any sudden urges to get up &amp; play Skyrim. It was just a little thought, in the back of my mind, keeping me awake. Could Ryphjot actually be real? Of course not, it would be way too hard to find him! And yet, a small part of me wanted to find out.


The next moring, I got up, had some jelly toast &amp;  A mug of tea, then went to work. When i got back, I booted up my awesome Gaming PC, and started Skyrim. I played a couple quests, found some gold, got some new gear, and just generally kicked ass. Then, I remembered Ryphjot. Could he be real? I wasn't about to commit to anything, but i saved my game, went to the main menu, and started a new one. On the hardest difficulty.


Fast forward two months, I still haven't beaten it six times. My death count is 127, and I still haven't given up yet. I don't know what makes it so addicting, trying to beat it over and over again. I'm on my fifth playthrough in a row, without dying, on the hardest difficulty, without quitting out at all. Fifth playthrough, in attempt 128. I'm determined to beat it this time, but it's damn hard. Whenever I go to bed, i just minimize it, without turning off my computer. Thank god for minimizing.


A week has passed, and I've finally did it. I beat Skyrim, six times in a row, without quitting the game out, on the hardest difficulty, without dying. What the fuck am i doing with my life? I'm a grown man! I'm not living in my mom's basement, i have a full-time job, and I have a girlfriend! But, this obsession has been causing problems, lately. My boss has threatened to fire me if I miss work one more time, and my girlfriend has been going to ""Girl's night out"" with her ""Friends"". I'm afraid she's cheating on me.


I started another new game, and I've been searching far &amp; Wide for Ryphjot, but to no avail. I'm beginning to fear that all of my hard work was forfeit, that Ryphjot is just a hoax. Then, one day while I was wandering through the outskirts of Whiterun, I saw something. A nord, clad in steel armor, walking across the top of a hill. It was almost sundown, I sprinted towards him. When I got to him, I saw that his name was Ryphjot. I was so happy &amp; Relieved! Finally, something to show for my effort! I talked to him, and he said ""Hello, friend. Anything I can do for you?"" There were two options I could say. 'No, goodbye.' and 'Heard any rumors lately?'. I chose 'Heard any rumors lately?' and, he responded with ""Yes, I heard that the dragon Alduin has returned, and he resides at the Throat of the world. If you defeat him, I'll give you a reward,"" The conversation window exited, and then the sun set. He disappeared in a cloud of ice magic particles, and I recieved a quest. 'Defeat Alduin'.


I walked back to Whiterun, to get some new gear to fight Alduin with. However, all of the villagers were gone, and the doors to their houses were locked. I saved, and tried picking a few, hoping to attract some guards. But, whenever I tried to pick the lock to one of their houses, I was given a message saying 'You cannot pick locks, you are doing a quest.' I thought this was odd, because that never happens when doing a quest. Skyrim is supposed to be a free-roaming game, even while in quests! I eventually gave up looking for people, and exited Whiterun. As soon as I did, i hear the ""Dooovaaahkiiin!!!"" from the greybeards, that plays when you defeat your first dragon. I looked to the throat of the world, and saw the dark sillhouette of Alduin, circling the peak.


I walked to the throat of the world, each step I take making me regret I ever got mixed up in this mess. When i arrived at the greybeard's building, I got to the door, and it was unlocked. I got inside, and I saw the greybeards, standing there, facing me. I walked up to one of them and I talked to him. He said, in his usualt voice, ""dovahkiin, are you prepared to face Alduin?"" There were two options. ""Yes."", and ""No."". Of course, I said Yes. Then, I was given a loading screen. After the loading screen finished, I was thrust to the peak of the Throat of the World. I looked around. The sky was that of the Sould Cairn, which was strange, because i hadn't bought Dawnguard, just seen a few videos of it. In the background, the mountains &amp; Major cities were getting annihilated by meteorites. It was raining hard, and I felt like I was really excited to fight Alduin, but also really scared at the same time. The distant screams of the villagers grew louder, and then the Dragon battle music started playing. Alduin swooped down from the sky, and landed with a huge smash. He looked at me, his eyes piercing my very soul. ""Do you want to fight me?"" He said. This time, I wasn't given any options of what to say. My character readied his weapon without my control, and then stepped towards Alduin. I was given back control, and the fight began.


It was insanely difficult, but I managed to defeat him. When I did, his body fell right in front of my character, and I absorbed his soul. Then, I was teleported to the edge of the Throat of the World, and Ryphjot appeared infront of me. I suddenly felt very sad, for some reason, and Ryphjot said ""Thank you."" Then, he stabbed my character in the chest, and kicked me off the mountain. As soon as I hit the ground, the game exited to the title, and deleted the save. Just my actual save from playing my original character was there. None of the seven saves from attempting to find Ryphjot, just my original character.


Epilogue:

The next morning, I started up Skyrim, and played on my normal save. There was nothing different, except that my character had a new weapon, a daedric sword. it was called 'Ryphjot's Reward', and it was mad powerful. it did 9,999,999 damage per hit, and sold for a million gold. But, there was something odd about it. Whenever I had it equipped, all the NPCs fled from me, and called out for help. They treated me like I had murdered somebody, and there was a bounty of 9,999 gold on my head. Even I began to fear it.

I don't know why the developers would put something like this into the game...

But, maybe it wasn't the developers. ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1365826706.0,,,True,t3_1c8ktm,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1c8ktm/obscure_skyrim_npc_a_creepypasta_written_my_me/,

Not when it's so close. But I need to tell people about this so that they don't suffer the same fate as I will. 
    Three weeks ago, as I was riding my bike to my friends house. I was riding on the sidewalk near the woods when I saw what looked like a face in the trees. I got off of my bike and went to get a better look at it. As I was getting closer, a tree passed in front of my vision and when I walked around the tree, the face was gone. 
     I took it as my imagination and moved on. But for the rest of the day I couldn't shake the feeling that someone or something was watching me. Man was I right. When I finally got to my friends house, we played some video games and then went outside so that he could show off his new airsoft gun. (I will refer to my friend as John for the rest of the story) John was aiming down the sights to shoot a target I had set up in the woods. He managed to hit it a few times before a strange look came across his face. He mouthed the words, ""Don't turn around"", but like any normal 15 year old boy, that's exactly what I did. There it was again, in the trees, just like before. The face. First I saw its chin, it appeared to be a normal persons chin. Then the mouth. Normal, exept for the demonic smile that told me that this thing took a sick pleasure in killing. Then th nose, normal as well. I didn't want to look at the eyes. I wanted to think that this was just a creepy,psychopathic, man who we could call the cops on and this would just all go away. But I also knew that I had to look. So I did. What I saw were dark,empty pits that told of my own death countless times. Worst of all was the fact that the eyes spoke of an evil that has been around since the beginning of time. I knew I had to be looking into the eyes of the devil himself. And he wanted my mind,my soul,and my blood. 
     The face was evil, so you can understand when I turned and ran, terrified, from the face. But I will never understand why John just looked at me...and smiled. That same evil smile that the face has. It was at that moment that I looked in my friends eyes and saw a terrified boy in them. Screaming, screaming for me to save him. There was nothing I could do. I saw that kid inside, the kid I had been friends with since third grade, be killed and ripped apart inside his own body. I turned an ran. I ran as fast as I could and didn't stop. 
    I made it to my house and I know that he followed me here. I'm typing this so that I don't have to look into those eyes again. I know that as soon as I turn around he's going to do to me what he did to John. 
    As I told you at the beginning, I want to save people from my fate. So here I go. If you see a face in the woods. In the trees. Don't. Look. Into. The eyes.

When i was a kid I would spend hours playing Pokemon Red with my favorite pokemon, Bulbasaur. I then got Yellow,Green, and so on. As i got older I didnt play as much pokemon, I played games like Burnout and Halo. I still did get every pokemon game and played it to its extent but i wasnt as much into it as i was before. After I got Pokemon Black 2 I decided to stop getting the newest pokemon games. I had eventually beat Black 2 and started to play other games, until a new game store opened up near my house. The game store was called KO Games, or Knockout Games. It was a store that only stayed in my town of Andover in MA. This game store was a peculiar gamestore though. It somehow could get games that no other store could. It was like the store owner knew people who worked at gaming companies and had them make games for him. The store also had retro games and new games. A few of the special games that were only sold there are, COD War Machines, Left 4 Dead 3, and Pokemon Plasma. Since I had stopped playing Pokemon I wasnt interested in buying Plasma for the DS, until I learned more about it. Pokemon Plasma boasted having all 650 pokemon and all 33 starter pokemon to choose from. I instantly knew I had to get that game. Having a team of a Ditto, Electrabuzz, Spoink, Bulbasaur, Swinub, and Zangoose on one team would be awesome. You were also allowed to go to any region you want. Obviously when KO Games came out I was going to zoom to it. I even pretended I was sick to miss school and get the game early. once I got there and i entered the shop, it seemed like the best place ever. There was a section for almost everything. Atari, NES, Panasonic 3DO, N64, Gameboy, Xbox/Xbox 360, PS 1,2, and 3, Wii and much, much more. When I finally found the DS section  the first thing that showed up was Pokemon Plasma. It was chrome and was incredibly shiny. When i stood in the ginourmous line I saw I was not the only one planning on getting the game. Kids, teens, and even adults were getting the game. It took me about 30 minutes to finally pay. Once I got home i instantly put my game into the DS and watched it start up. The nintendo logo showed up and the title screen came on. The screen showed Charizard and Emboar two fire type pokemon that were evolved starters. Once i started I was greeted by a lady who said ""Welcome to the pkmn center, here we restore your pokemon to full health. Would you like to pick your starter pokemon?"" I clicked yes and it showed me all 33 of them. I chose bulbasaur and headed out on my journey. I started and the first pokemon i met was Scraggy. He was an easy pokemon to beat. Next I fought a pikachu, once again i defeated him with ease. My next pokemon I had to battle was a huge step forward. Somehow a Charizard appeared. My pokemon being a level 6 was defeated almost instantly. After the battle i went straight to the pokemon center to heal and when I entered and gave the Bulbasaur to nurse joy she said, ""i am sorry there is nothing we can do."" and she gave me back my pokeball. I was confused and just put down the DS for a moment and wondered what she could have meant. A loud noise came out of my DS and a text box appeared asking "" Put it out of his misery"" and a yes or no box appeared. I clicked no at first but then a text box appeared saying ""He cannot be saved."" An animation of bulbasaur being put into a pokeball and then fading into darkness appeared. Above the animation written in red said ""Bye Bye Bulbasaur"" and then i heard bulbasaurs battle cry blaring through the DS. then silence. The screen went black and then nurse joy greeted me saying, ""Try to be moore careful next time"" and i was allowed to pick my new starter. I tried to choose bulbasaur but he was locked inside of a pokeball with a skull on it. every time I tried to click on him I heard his battle cry and a little bit of blood seeped out of the pokeball. I then went over to Tepig. I chose him and then a man greeted me. He told me that I should feel bad for what ive done. He then told me to come to his house. As I walked in I saw my Bulbasaur with burn marks all over its body on his wall. He walked over to it and said ""Look at what you have done... I will help you so that this never happens again."" He gave me a TM called Hyper Fuse. He then booted me out of his house and gave me a Woobat with the moves fly and heart stamp with it. He instructed me to go to Kanto to talk to someone named Nishumoro. I did as he told me to. Woo bat dropped me off in a patch of grass and I sawa man who greeted me in happy go lucky pokemon fashion and we battled. He had a grass type and in one move I brought his HP to 1%. However now the only move I could chose to finish him off was Hyper Fuse. I used it and his pokemon exploded. I was shocked they would put this in a pokemon game and then after the battle the man got down on his knees and began to cry. He sputtered out ""Y-you monster, he's dead."" and then the man's expression changed into anger. He then charged at me and without me doing anything tepig used Hyper Fuse,and the man let out a blood curdling screem and fell to the ground. Dead.Then two police officers showed up and attempted to put  handcuffs on me. I then had the options to be sent to jail or to escape. i obviously hit escape and then tepig once again used Hyper Fuse and instantly the officers dropped dead. My character had a devilish grin and he stared into the camera. He then looked at my tepig and said, ""I think we could become great friends..."" I was shocked by how grotesque the game actually was and I doubtingly pressed on. I fought a squirtle an since my pokemon had a much higher level i beat him and captured him. A jumbled mess of sounds showed up. I coulld barely make out ""NOOOO I DONT WANT TO BE ONE OF YOU MURDERERS!!!!!""  I felt like my ears would explode. As i wandered around Kanto and battled more, I noticed that Hyper Fuse would only work when my pokemon or my  opponents pokemon were almost defeated. I guess it was sort of like a finishing move... a very deadly finishing move.... I eventually found Nishumoro and he told me that I am an outlaw and that I was a monster and so on and so forth. He then told me to talk to a man named Ticherra (TI-ch-arra)
and he would help me clear my name. I fought more pokemon and eventually had a pretty decent team of pokemon. I had been training because I was sure that we would battle. When i met him, sure enough we battled. He had one pokemon. It was a pokemon I had never heard of. It was called ghost and only used one move, curse. I couldent believe it! curse was killing all my pokemon, and instead of them fainting it did what Hyper Fuse did and killed them. My last pokemon I had was Tepig, which was now a Pignite. Ghost killed my pignite and the battle ended. My character was on the ground weeping
and then a man put handcuffs on me and sent me to prison. The screen faded to black and next thing i knew my character was on the electric chair when a priest asked If i had any last words. My character nodded and said ""Look where youve got me. Look at all the pokemon you have killed. I am not the monster you are. See you in hell fucker!"" The game went black once again, a scream was heard and then my DS shut off. I tried playing it again but when I did it was just a scream repeated in a loop over and over. Sometimes when i am playing any game, Halo, Mario, Burnout someone with a mic or even in the game will always say ""You're the monster not me"".



EPILOGUE
The game was recalled once I told KO games about my experience. KO games also closed down when there was a fire that burnt it down exactly one week after my experience. The strangest part is nobody else had the same problem as me. A few people still may own it today but I know that a lot of kids that were scared of my experience destroyed it in fear. It is a collector's item now and is worth over 25,000 dollars! It is also considered the greatest pokemon game to date and maybe the greatest game on the DS. Also the pokemon ghost is from the game Creepy Black, I do not own it but I am trying to find it. After this experience I took a long break from pokemon but eventually i got back to playing it. My friend Dylan owns POkemon Platinum and sometimes i play it but sometimes, just sometimes when he talks to people they will say ""You're the monster not me"".",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_187uku,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/187uku/pokemon_plasma/,

	My story begins on a road in the Mojave Desert. I was driving from my home in San Jose to Vegas in my old convertible. It was around 6 at night and the sun was beginning to set. The cool air of summer blew through my hair and I took a deep breath. I don’t know how long I was driving, maybe an hour and the sun was just setting below the horizon. This was weird to me, I should’ve been in Vegas by now, or I should’ve at least seen some buildings or signs. 
“Had I taken a wrong turn?” I thought to myself. 
I concluded that that couldn’t be possible, this was a straight road. I continued driving along the road and it soon got dark. Suddenly I felt exhausted, my head got heavy and my sight dimmed. I had to find some place to stop or I was going to pass out. Less than a minute later I saw lights. Lights! I drove towards the light and noticed it was a hotel, as if something knew I had to stop somewhere for the night. I pulled into a parking spot and walked to the front door. Hanging about the door was a lit up sign that read ‘HOTEL CALIFORNIA’. A woman opened the door and stood in the doorway with a lit candle. 
“Hello, sir. Will you be checking in tonight?” she asked. 
“Yes, do you have room?” I said. 
She smiled at me. I could never forget her smile, it was the most beautiful I had ever seen. 
“Plenty of room at the Hotel California,” she responded. “Come, come.” 
She led me to the front desk and checked me in. 
“Now, let me show you to your room,” she said sweetly as she led me down the hall. All of the sudden I heard voices that seemed to be coming from the rooms. 
“Welcome to the Hotel California,” they sang. “Such a lovely place, such a lovely place. Such a lovely face. Plenty of room at the Hotel California. Any time of year, any time of year, you can find it here. 
I dismissed the singing as just being a recording coming through speakers in the walls. Why would the guests sing about how lovely the hotel was every time someone checked in? We got to the room and she opened the door. 
“Have a nice sleep,” the woman said. 
I mumbled something and passed out on the bed, I had never been so tired in my life. 
I woke up the next morning, completely refreshed. I left my room and went looking for a place in the hotel to get breakfast. I passed by the courtyard and the woman from last night dancing with some handsome men. I entered the courtyard and sat on a bench and watched them. She saw me and sat on the bench next to me. She had a small amount of sweat coming down her face. 
“Why do you dance?” she asked. 
“What?” I asked, confused. 
“Why do you dance?” she asked again. “Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.” 
I pondered her question for a few seconds. 
“When I dance I don’t usually think about anything,” I said. “I’m exactly focused on anything, I’m just enjoying myself. So I guess I dance to forget.”
She nodded. 
“I dance to remember,” she said. “To remember how my life was a few years back.” 
“What about your life changed?” I asked her. “How is it different?” 
“Well,” she said, I could sense a bit of sadness in her voice. “… it’s not something I really want to talk about right now.” 
“That’s fine, I understand.” I said. 
“Thank you,” her smile returned. “Well, I’m hungry, would you like to join me for lunch?” 
“Lunch?” I asked, a little confused. “what time is it?” 
“Noon.” 
“Wow, I must’ve been really tired. Well, I don’t see why not, I am hungry.” 
She walked with me to  the dining room and we sat down. The food was absolutely delicious, I didn’t think anything could taste so good. The waiter came by and I asked him for a glass of wine. 
“Very good sir,” he said with much enthusiasm. “We haven’t had that spirit here since…oh, ’77.” 
I was astonished to say the least. No one has requested wine in this hotel for 36 years? Surely he must be joking, there was many people staying in this hotel to begin with. The waiter returned with the wine and the woman I talked for about half before she had to do some work around the hotel. I grew tired again and returned to bed. 
I awoke in the middle of the night. I turned my head groggily to look at the clock. 2:37 a.m. I groaned and stared up at the ceiling. In the silence I heard faint chanting. As I focused on the noise I realized that it was the song that the guests had sung when I had first came to this place. 
“Welcome to the Hotel California…” 
The words were the same but the tone was… different. There wasn’t any enthusiasm in the voices, almost robotic. I got up and decided to investigate. I walked out of my room and saw the woman that I had been spending time with. 
“What’s with the chanting?” I asked. 
“The guests tend to do that,” she said. “Come with me, I need to talk to you.” 
She led me to the staff lounge. It was a very impressive lounge, especially for it being a staff lounge. There were red couches in the center, a tv, and a bar. There were also darts boards and a billiard table. The most interesting part of this lounge however, was the ceiling. The entirety of the ceiling was covered with many different mirrors. It was a very interesting decoration, and it really set a mood for the room. The woman had me sit on a couch while she went to the bar. She came back with glasses filled with a pink liquid. 
“Pink champagne on ice?” she asked. 
I nodded and took one of the glasses, taking a sip. 
“Now, why the hell are the guests chanting? Why haven’t I seen any of them actually leave their rooms? I have not seen very many people in this hotel, just what the hell is going on here?!” I demanded. 
She sighed. 
“I guess I probably should tell you,” she said. “We are all just prisoners here, of our own device.” 
“Prisoners? What are you talking about? No one is in chains, there aren’t any cells.” 
 “This hotel doesn’t appear to many people, that’s why there aren’t many arrivals. Usually only lone travelers will encounter the hotel. People always stop here when they see it because they always feel exhausted, even if they don’t know why.” 
“What?!” I demanded. “Are you high or something? You are acting as if this hotel is a living thing!” 
“No, the hotel isn’t alive, it’s cursed.” 
“Cursed? Why?” 
“No one really knows, the owner has long since passed away. All we know is that we are prisoners here until the curse is lifted.” 
“How do you lift the curse?” 
“When the curse was placed a demon appeared in the master’s chambers. From what we know if the demon was killed the curse would be killed along with it.” 
“So why not just kill it?” 
“What do you think we have been trying to do? Ever other night all of the staff go into the demon’s room and stab it with knives all night. There seems to be no way to stop it. There’s no escape.” 
I had enough of listening to this. I ran out of the room and down the hall. Whether or not she was telling the truth didn’t matter, these people were crazy. I went into the lobby and pushed the nightman out of my way while running out the door. 
“Relax,” He called after me. “We are programmed to receive. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.” 
I sprinted out to my car and took off down the road. Not in a few minutes I saw the lights of Vegas. Finally! Now my vacation can continue! As I let out a sigh of relief I saw another car coming down the road. It was heading right for me! I tried to swerve out of the way but I wasn’t fast enough. It struck me and I immediately blacked out. 
I awoke in a hospital bed to the sound of a woman’s voice. 
“Well, you are a very lucky man to survive such an accident,” the voice said cheerfully. “The only injury you have is a broken arm.” 
I opened my eyes fully and looked at the woman standing at the side of my bed. By how she was dressed I could easily assume she was a nurse. I looked up to see her face. She smiled at me. I could never forget her smile, it was the most beautiful I had ever seen.

Anyways, let me know what you think. :)

I walked up to the kitchen door slowly, terrified. As I crept up to it, I heard an agressive growl. After a while it stopped. I figured it must have left. I opened the door slowly. Half-heartedly knowing the horror I would see behind it if it was still there. At first, it just stood there, continuing to go through the kitchen for food/pills/or whatever it wanted. It then, looked at me. It's body looked bad enough on it's own, but when I saw the horrible face, I stood there in shock. It had the eyeballs of Jeff The Killer, and the teeth of a wolf. It just stood there with it's expressionless face. It's body like nothing I'd ever seen before. It had a slender body, with knives as hands and tiny holes throughout it's body. It looked as if it had been burned, but not severely. It charged at me, and I tried to keep my distance. It jabbed at me with it's knives, but i evaded it's attacks. I tried to make my way to the kitchen knives so I could maybe have a chance against the monster. It realized what I was doing and tried to back me into the corner. Fear rushed through my body, and adrenaline began to kick in. It didn't matter though, I was still no match for this monster with my bare hands. 

I slowly backed into the corner as it tried to slash at me. I couldn't stall any longer. I jabbed at it with my fists, I landed a successful blow, but quickly withdrew my hand, as it felt like it was on fire. I didn't have time to attend to my hand, so I went to the counter and picked up a meat clever with my good hand. I knew this wasn't going to end pretty, but I had to put up a fight.

 I wasn't as coordinated with my left hand as I was with my right. I went for a stab and he'd just block it with it's hands. I chopped again and it blocked again, however I quickly withdrew the clever and chopped it's body. It was damaged, but I was left open. As I was drawing back my clever, it stabbed me with one of it's knives. I quickly jumped back in agony, I tried to run, but it was just faster. I reached the end of the hallway to the door of my parets room. It was coming onto me, without thinking, I threw my clever and it hit it right in the head. It cried out in agony, and fell to the ground.

It was over, or was it? It's head raised and then opened it's mouth to say something. ""This isn't over. I'm going to have fun with you. I'll be back soon. And I'll kill you next time."" It grimaced, and in an instant, it was gone.

I'll never know when it's coming back for me, but when it does, I'll be ready too.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1358727492.0,,,True,t3_16ya8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16ya8e/the_radio_whispers_part_2/,

I wish i had a less vague recollection of it but my brother and i are high as fuck right now and I was telling him about it and he really wants to read it. 

okay, that aside, i read the story probably over the spring or early summer, i think it was a featured story somewhere or something at that time. 

it was basically about a guy who moves in with another guy, l almost wanna say its into like a hella abandoned building or something. 

the first guys roomate starts becoming obsessed with a certain person, it's a male name and its fairly common and i don't remember it. i can't remember if he even knows the person, but i think this name keeps popping up everywhere, and all these people he knows are bringing up this name/asking about this name. maybe chanting it? 

and at the end the roommate either commits suicide or is beaten to death or something presumably at the hands of this person or name. 


for some reason this story has started to mingle with fight club in my mind. and i keep thinking ""his name was tyler durden"" but of course that's not right.

i am very sorry for my marijuana-fueled ramblings, if anyone else knows what this story is that would be extremely helpful. for some reason it's really important to me that i read this again. thank you. 


EDIT: also i just remembered that the roommate spirals into a deep depresson/manic paranoia or something in regards to this name, that he like can't pull himself out of before he dies. i think this story centers more around the fear of the name itself then the person behind it.

1346852649.0,10,self.creepypasta,ze4t8,The Painting in the Shed,FlackBotter,13,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/ze4t8/the_painting_in_the_shed/,"  I remember as a small girl always being horrified by the stained, faded oil-painting that lived in our shed, I remember at one point that it was in the house, when perhaps I was too young to remember where, but it lived in the shed, along with a mixture of my home's forgotten and indispensable paraphernalia; my father's wine brewing kit, stained with moss and lichen; a crystal decanter set; a half a broken chair. 

  The picture – it was horrifying, huge moulted swathes of browns and greens and orange, not well mastered or carefully crafted, even as a child I could see how rushed and fanatic the art was. In it sat a woman on top of a wardrobe, uncomfortably hunched, naked, a look of pain on her face as her legs and arms draped down beside her. Below my pained lady, in front of the wardrobe, an old crone stood, clutching the lady's right leg with gnarled fingers, until the leg was black and blighted. While the lady looked into the distance, the crone stared straight at you, through the picture, all the time grinning.

  I was barred from the shed as it was deemed a general safety hazard, but I would return to play with the much coveted hammer, or a collection of useless empty tin cans. But it was difficult to stay in there for too long without going back to that infernal painting, I would stare at this picture for hours - perhaps it was minutes, it's hard to say how a length of time feels to a child. That painting was engrained in my memory, every detail of that hellish scene, as I absorbed what to my child-like mind was forbidden knowledge. 

  The painting was a fixture of that shed, and I never questioned why it was there or who painted it or its purpose. Looking back now, I wonder who took the time to bother framing it, or if there was an artist's signature hidden somewhere therein, even if there was I would not have been able to read it. That painting disappeared, and like all children I accepted that, and never thought of it again. It was only until years later I remembered it while mulling in my room, and asked about it origins.

  “A painting?” my mother replied, confused, “in the shed?”

  “Yes,” I replied, “of two woman, one on a wardrobe with a black leg.”

  “John!” My mother screeched, “do you know anything about a painting in the shed?”

  “What painting?” My father asked.

  “From years ago!” My mother shouted back.

  My father came plodding through into the kitchen, drying his hands, “what, that painting Chris painted?”

  “Oh, maybe,” my mother replied, “your Uncle Chris, Beth, he had a painting that was in the shed. It was of your room.”

  “My room!” I was horrified, as I began to calculate the possibility.

  “Before we painted everything over in pink,” my father said, “it's the corner with the wardrobe and the window. Possibly the most normal thing he painted,” he laughed at that.

  “That was nowhere near normal,” I replied, visions of the crone entering my head.

  “You should have seen some of the stuff he painted when he was alive, pretty grotesque stuff.” My father replied,  “I think a still life is pretty normal.”

  Slowly what my father was saying dawned on me, “what about the women in the picture?”

  “There were no women,” my father frowned, “maybe you're thinking of a different picture. It had the wardrobe in it. He drew it when he lived in your room, back when he was here for rehabilitation. I told him to paint something that might sell!”

  “She'd have been too young to remember, John,” my mother quipped, “Chris lived in your room for a while after living on the streets, you were still in the crib in our room.”

  My mind began to whirr as I tried to remember what I knew of Uncle Chris, “he...he didn't die in my room, did he?” I asked slowly.

  “Not unless your room is a field is Norfolk,” my father muttered darkly, “he left long before that.”
  There were a few moments of what felt like uncomfortable silence, “we threw that out a long, long time ago. It was terrible,” my father said,  “his hands were always shaking when he painted it,” he shook his head, “I'm surprised you still remember it.”

  Upstairs, I began to peel baby pink paint off the edge of my wardrobe, in the hope of finding some sort of brown lacquer beneath - it didn't seem to work, only pink and wood chips came up beneath my fingernails. But sure enough, the wardrobe was the right size and shape, and was even the right part of the room, fixed to the wall. A cold chill went down my spine as I considered the picture, the placing of the closet, and the window. Was there anything outside the window in the picture? I couldn't remember, but seeing how low the sloped ceiling was, it was clear why the lady sitting would be so hunched. 

  And yet my family didn't remember people in the painting at all, my father called it a still life! Albeit they barely remembered the painting full stop. 

  I wondered about my Uncle Chris, I never knew him personally, but I knew he was hooked on drugs, though not what; I knew he shot himself in the head, but not why. He painted, but was never successful -  and until today I had never seen one painting by him, or thought I hadn't. A few thoughts went through my head, was Chris a fan of the grotesque or addled in the brain?

  I dismissed the latter option immediately, it was unfair to assume that because he was unstable he was somehow insane. Chris was rehabilitated when he painted here. He took a room and he moulded it into something more interesting, more attention grabbing, because he was an artist.
  
  But then why did no one else see what was in the picture?

  I looked at the wardrobe, and mulled it over. In my head I could see the girl, and where the old woman was standing. If I stood beside my bed then the scene was almost perfect. I could picture Chris sitting with an easel.

  A mad thought swept me. I placed my wooden chair – now an unhealthy peeling pink – beside the wardrobe, facing towards the door. I then removed the curtain rail from the window and placed it on my bed, letting the pale daylight enter the room unmolested. I twisted the bed around, pressed against the wall so that it was hidden from view from where Chris would have sat. I pulled off posters and removed the rug, until the scene looked bare. A spare room a homeless man might find respite in. There. There was the scene, picture perfect. 

  Now another mad thought took me. Balancing on my good leg, I hoisted myself on top of the wardrobe from the chair I had placed beside it. The ceiling sloped here so I was forced to hunch forwards – it seemed the room was posing me itself. My hands and backside were covered in an unhealthy inch of dust, now disturbed and dancing in the clear daylight. The lip of the wardrobe painfully pressing into the back of my knees.

  Sitting up there, I could easily imagine Chris in the middle of the room, painting not carefully or with much forethought, but madly, with a frenzy of brush strokes as oil was stacked upon oil. I imagined a frenzied painter mad, unshaven, looking up fervently, scared of what he saw but driven to finish it.

  A sudden realization took me. I looked down at my own legs, as if for the second time. That black leg of the woman in the picture, so pained and dead looking, would match in orientation to my own prosthetic limb.

  I felt for the seam in my jeans. Just below the knee. Yes, that too was where the miasma ended in the painting.

  My hands gripped the lip of the wardrobe until my knuckles turned white. Ideas began to run through my head. I was run over by a geriatric driver in two thousand and seven. I lost my right leg. It was a woman, but did she look like the crone in the picture? I only saw her briefly. It all happened too fast. The driver was smiling, she had a stroke at the wheel, apparently.

Did the naked, anguished woman look like me? Was it me? I could never comfortably tell from that point on, and as the years went by the panting faded from my memory and it became harder and harder to judge, and I have never slept in the same room since.

  And though it does not happen often, that ghostly tingle that sometimes accompanies missing limbs has felt far too much like the touch of old, gnarled fingers.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_ze4t8,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/ze4t8/the_painting_in_the_shed/,

I got in his car, and he drove me down to the house. It was a bare February day. The trees were thin and stripped, and the grass in the lawns was brittle, and neither of us talked. He drove for about 10 minutes and pulled up in front of a two-story home. It looked sturdy but smallish and not very promising. We got out, and when we slammed the car doors you could hear them echo off of houses farther down the road. The sky was pale.  
We went up the frozen front walk and he hurried past me to unlock the door for us. He was a tall man with a nice black overcoat. I shivered a bit in my neck. I only had on my Patriots jacket and it was a little too cold. He pulled the door open and nodded at me politely and I stepped into the house. I stopped at the entrance and looked around.  
“I'm sorry,” he said. “Let me just get in here.”  
I was blocking his way. I took one one step farther and looked around more. He shoulder brushed up against my back as he closed the door. It came closed with a clink.  
“Well,” he said behind me, but I didn't move. He turned himself sideways and slid past me in the front entrance and stepped into the living room. “Here it is,” he said.  
“Yeah,” I said.  
“So, is this it?”  
My jaw kind of moved around instead of saying anything.  
“This is it, right? You knew before you stepped in, right?”  
I nodded.  
“It's not anything you're looking at, is it? That's not how you know this is the place. I mean, we've got a couch here, some pictures on the wall, a TV, little coffee table. But so does every other house in America. That's not how you know. No. It's the smell, isn't it? It's the smell.” He took a big sniff and frowned and nodded his head like he was understanding something. “Yeah. They've got two little kids. You can tell. That baby powder diaper smell or whatever it is. That medicine fragrance smell trying to cover up another smell. And the smell of the carpet, the wood. Hey, come here, you'll remember this.”
He took a few steps into the living room and waved his hand for me to follow him. He was wearing black gloves. I still had my hands shoved in my pockets even though it was pretty warm in the house. I took them out and followed him. We went straight through the living room to the kitchen. It was a really small house. There were wood counters, linoleum, a window looking out on the backyard.
“Come on,” he said, waving me to come over next to him by the sink.  
I followed.  
“This is it, right? Smell that. She used to smoke Marlboro Menthols right here over the sink when it was cold. She'd ash in the sink and blow the smoke out of this little window. You smell that? Every time you come in the kitchen it'd smell like old hamburger fat and Marlboro Menthols. Right?”
There was a green pack of Marlboros sitting on the ledge in by the dish soap. There was still about half a pack left. I could feel my eyelids getting tight and my lips setting in their place. I didn't really want to give anything away to this guy so I just nodded.  
“You wanna go upstairs? You remember what's upstairs, right? White carpet. They had the kids' TV up there. They had the Nintendo and the Sega. The little zapper gun. He had all the good games. You remember all that, right? A lot of fun up there. Nothing to smell up there, though, right?”  
I didn't nod this time.  
“Come on,” he said.  
He grabbed on the sleeve of my Patriots jacket and nodded for us to leave the kitchen. He didn't pull on my sleeve. I followed him. We went out of the kitchen through the other door to the back hall. There was a door going out to the backyard and another door.  
“Why go upstairs, when you can go downstairs?” he said.  
He opened up the other door and my hand clenched. It was dark inside. He flipped a switch and a little fluorescent light came on overhead. A set of wooden stairs went down between two white cinder block walls to a small red door. I could feel my heart beating in my chest now.  
“Yeah,” he said. “There it is. That basement smell. I guess it's mold or whatever. If you asked me what the smell was, I'd just say, 'basement.' It smells like a basement to me.”  
He let go of my sleeve.  
“Go on,” he said. “Go on.”  
I went down the stairs. It was all so much smaller and more cramped than it should be. I could put my hands on both walls and still have my arms halfway bent. Too narrow. And it wasn't deep enough. There was only about 15 stairs, but it seemed like there should be more. I came to the bottom and stood in front of the red door. He came down after me and stood right behind me, one stair above.  
I thought he'd go on about smells, what this or that smelled like, but he didn't say anything. I guess he was giving me my time. I looked at the red door for a while. There was nothing magical about it. It was red with a flat face and a bright brass knob on one side. The hinges were a little rusted. Everything was so normal. It was just a door.  
“Take your time,” he said.  
He was trying to sound patient and understanding and it annoyed me a bit. After dragging me here, now he had the nerve to tell me to take my time? I glanced at the knob and looked back at the flat red face of the door.  
“You know what's behind that door, don't you?” he asked.  
Now this was annoying. Ever since I had agreed to meet him, it had been nothing but mind games. Oh, look, he'd say, this is where she'd smoke Marlboro Menthols, and here's where the Nintendo was. As if he new the first fucking thing. He pretended like he knew everything about this house.  
“You know what's behind that door. Open it,” he said.  
My vision blurred. I put my head down a bit and made sure my shoulders were really still. I wasn't going to let him know I was crying. I didn't weep or sob or anything. But tears were running down my face and dripping on the zippers of my jacket.  
“Open that door, Ryan.”  
I knew he was looking at the back of my head. What was he seeing? The head of a stocky 32 year old man with light brown hair. I hadn't gotten a haircut in a while. I got my haircuts about once a month but sometimes I let it slide. It probably looked pretty shaggy now. It had been maybe two months.  
“You have to open that door, Ryan. Open it.”  
I knew what he saw when he was looking at me. I wasn't really stocky. I was just fat now. Especially in this puffy Patriots jacket. My shoulders sagged. I had bad posture. I looked like a sad sack, like a security guard, like a former high-school football player who had become some fat old piece of shit.  
“Open it, Ryan.”  
“I can't open that door,” I said. He could tell I was crying now from my voice. “I can't open that fucking door. I can't. I'm grown up now.”  
He put his hand on my back. I pushed back a bit but it was like there was a wall behind me. The door opened from the inside. I saw the old white hand holding the inside knob and I saw the sleeve of the blue sweater. I knew what that sweater smelled like.  
“No,” I said. It came out like a kid's voice.  
I saw the round shape of that old drooping face.  
“No,” I shouted. “No, I didn't even do anything bad.”  ",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_oktbs,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/oktbs/the_red_door/,

1321819278.0,9,self.creepypasta,mj9rg,The Scottish Highlands,Juggernog,15,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/mj9rg/the_scottish_highlands/,"In the Scottish highlands in the early fourteenth century, there was a small tribe – their name was likely in Celtic, but our sources leave us clueless as to the actual full name of the group. What we do know, from reading old diaries left behind by those who had died, was that their leader was named ‘Vanca’, we do not know - nor will ever likely know - the mans’ surname. We can also estimate from reports of the time that the group numbered a good twenty people, at the very least.

Old evidence suggests Vanca’s group were widely known for their notorious cannabilism, and they’d attack many unexpecting passers-by in the misty, gloomy highlands. They’d never get caught due to the extraordinarily low visibility prevalent in the mountains; meaning that the victims couldn’t expect anyone to hear their cries for help, not that it’d matter, as the sheer speed of the groups attacks didn’t leave much time for any action to be taken.

One diary entry by a peasant in Edinburgh gives a detailed report of an attack, it was thought at the time that she was the only person to see an attack and live to tell the tale. Her diary’s descriptions were brief, but mysterious – at the time, her writing was not verified or even evaluated for accuracy – it was a personal diary that she kept. The descriptions were as followed:

“On the trade route today, I saw several merchants coming to Edinburgh with a variety of goods, in preparation for the harvest season. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary at the time, apart from a hovering shroud of fog. This area of the mountains never gets foggy. Then it happened – quickly, and without remorse, these merchants were attacked by a party of perhaps fifteen men. They were pulled out of their vehicles by shadows of men, silhouettes amongst the falling sun in the background, stabbed, and pulled into the fog where they vanished - leaving only a trail of blood, left to stagnate amongst the yellowing grass.”

The authorities of the time dismissed her claims, she had very little evidence, and the site was never investigated due to the fact that her description was so vague that she was regarded as crazy, and her claims dismissed. The merchants cart was recorded and towed away in 1402, fifty years after the incident, the food cart left to rot – the road was reportedly very rarely used.

In 1409, many of the group were taken in by merchants who fought back when attacked. Vanca, and the majority of his groups, were sentenced to death without fair trial – they were hung at the gallows in the centre of Edinburgh according to multiple diary accounts, including the executioners, who reported feeling a distinct ‘dread’ they had never felt before in their lives when executing these criminals. The hangings were never officially recorded, but the sheer number of reports suggests that it did, in fact, happen.

After this, reports of disappearances in the mountains began to dissipate, reducing massively in their frequency – and since other cases were recorded, this is unlikely to be a case of laziness from the law enforcement.

No similar cases were recorded for years, and the road had maintenance performed on it to make it more useable and a more viable method of transport. However, in the winter of 1981, a very thick shroud of fog and mist lay over the mountains, reducing visibility to almost zero, as a large convoy carrying a felon who was regarded as very dangerous was passing through the mountains. The convoy dropped off the radar, all radio communication was lost, transmitting only an eerie static to the government, who had implemented the radio to continuously check up on the drivers and police officers on board.

When they were over three hours late for their arrival at the prison, it was assumed that something had gone very wrong indeed – the primary suspicion was already the felon onboard – a mass-murderer who had shown no remorse in court. He was being taken to a high-security prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for his crimes - had killed the police officers, disabled the tracking hardware and attempted to escape while the rest of the government assigned convoy persued him.

When they arrived at the scene, the cars were all stationary, the doors forced open – as if there had been a struggle, and some traces of blood on the vehicle, and a long bloodstain leading away from the vehicles, before abruptly stopping at approximately the same distances from the vehicles, as if they evaporated into thin air. The police still suspected the felon, until they discovered such a gruesome spectacle that its presence was never released to the general public.

They found the bodies of Officer Wilson, Officer Jones, Liutenant Rollings, Officer Spencer and the felon, hung from a noose attached to a tree, their bodies half eaten. Their bodies were quickly covered up, and the blood, as well as any other potentially disturbing articles, where removed from the scene – many of the articles cleaned up where not detailed in the report, but instead only referenced. Their cars were also towed away from the area, and kept as evidence.

From here, a similarly gruesome spectacle occurred each year, and the area of those affected will grow each year. On the attack of 1981, all the people in the area of 60m were attacked and found hanging from the tree. In the attack of 1982 everyone in the area of 120m was attacked, and by 1983, everyone in the area of 240m were brutally attacked.

At the rate of the increase of area  noted between years of attack, the entire world would be regarded as unsafe by 2009, and for this reason, I suggest that we issue a public safety announcement to look all the doors and windows during times of mist, as the six hundred victims of this years attack were all taken both from their homes and from their vehicles, only to be found partially cannibalized over the coming days, hanging from a noose in a nearby tree. Nowhere is safe.

This report was written by Officer Sulliven, I believe we are dealing with the paranormal. There is no other logical explanation.

I would wake up and head back to work, walking the 5 minutes to the subway, giving any change I had to the homeless woman and her young son who haunted the sidewalk in front of a nail salon, and ignoring every other person doing their own thing in the crowded city. I’d grab a coffee, and do as little as possible in the depressing cubicle where I spent the next 8 hours. I’d meet some friends on the weekends, and we'd go out to the imitation Irish pubs to complain about our week, or to play pool or something. 

But this one Tuesday- I remember because it was on Labour Day of last year, and the doorman at my apartment building joked that it was the last day I could wear white. I was running extremely late, and threw on a dress shirt and pants. I grabbed my bag at the door and started running. The homeless woman held her hand out but I ran by. The workday was as dull as any other. I forgot my lunch in the rush and had to suffer through unfairly expensive cafeteria food. Finally, I was on the way home. Again the homeless woman held out her hand, but I had gotten rid of my change at lunch. I thought she might understand, since I had been so generous before. But her usually shy son stood up, like he never had in front of me before. He spat a word at me- something that wasn’t English- and glared with a rage that made me think I saw a glint of red in his eyes. I shivered but carried on, knowing that I tried my best. 

But I know now that it was definitely more significant than I thought, because from that day onwards, I don't know anything. The first incident was a few days later. I was in a bar with a few college friends, watching the football game. We all just cheered and took big gulps of beer in celebration of the home team's third touchdown. With my glass drained, I rapped my knuckles on the counter to signal to the bartender that I needed another. And the response I heard was from a fancy-looking waiter behind me saying ""ooh, that's risky."" I blinked and found myself sitting at a casino. Evidently I was playing blackjack, because the dealer put another card in front of me as tapping the table like I had done is also an indicator for another card. Here I panicked. I dropped the cards, looked around for anyone or anything I knew. It was all completely unfamiliar. I started to sweat and had no way to respond to the concerned expressions of those around me. I stammered a question to the waiter, and found out that I was staying in a hotel room above the casino, and so I should just use that bathroom. I half-ran to my room, locating it using the room card in my pocket. Running down the long hallway, I just had to try and ignore the ringing sounds and strange whispers I heard. I headed straight to the bathroom, and splashed my face with water. It had to be a horribly vivid dream, or the effects of alcohol from the bar, which I definitely was still in, but asleep or hallucinating. Once I convinced myself of this, I walked back out into the room, and decided to explore. Every drawer was filled with my things, and judging from the state of messiness, I had been there for a long time. I thought a good rest might help clear my head.

Over the next day, I found out that I had left my job and girlfriend to live a more ‘free life’. The feeling of panic returned. I couldn’t be hallucinating this anymore. I decided to accept that I had a horrible case of amnesia, and had to use where I was as a starting point. I wanted to return to the life I knew, but found that I had lost most of my money gambling, and that I was in a different country. When I called anyone I knew from before, all their phone lines were dead. The only thing I could do was to try and win some money back, or find someone who would help. By the evening, I was talking to a friendly, older gentleman at the reception, and convinced him to drive me back to where I was from. I didn't, of course, tell him the whole problem. He just seemed to understand wanting to go back to a better place or time, and took pity on me. 
I sat in his Cadillac, slightly calmer with the prospect of returning to some normalcy, and navigated him down a few highways. Eventually I had to open out a separate map, and shook it in order to have it spread out so I could read it. However, as I did so, it became soft in my hands. The map had turned into a pillow I was fluffing, and when I looked beyond it, and found that I was back in my girlfriend's apartment. She was watching TV on the bed, and it seemed that I was about to join her. This couldn't be happening again. She asked me why I stopped moving and was staring out of the window at the snow. SNOW. In September? That wasn't normal where I was from. Not even close, for a place of that proximity to the equator. That worried me even more than the shadows crawling on the walls despite the lack of objects to cast them. It would no longer be possible that it was amnesia; I wasn’t in the same city, but everything else was the same. And there was no way everything was normal again after my gambling escapade. It was much too real and long to be a dream, or a drug trip, so I had to consider the next option:  I was losing my sanity. 

I trusted my girlfriend. She might believe me, or help me, or something. So I told her everything. She told me I needed to get help. But when we were in the psychologist’s waiting room, it happened again. A white wall became a bright headlight that was about to hit the car I was driving. I swerved out of the way, and blinked my eyes until I could clearly see the countryside stretching out on every side of me. That was the point I thought there was no hope. There was no base for anything anymore; everything I knew, or trusted, or believed didn’t exist or make sense. And I figured that the only way to beat a game with no rules was to quit. 

The first thing I tried was standing in the middle of the road with my arms stretched out and my eyes closed. But the only time I heard a car approaching and honking was instantly replaced with a loud whooshing of air and the feeling that my stomach had dropped out. I opened my eyes and found myself skydiving. Before I could intentionally hit the ground though, I landed on an indoor trampoline. I couldn’t even escape living. 

This has been going on for I-don’t-even-know how long now. But at least I’ve finally made it here doctor. And that’s my story. Please tell me there’s something you can do.”

The psychologist stopped taking notes for the last part of the story, and is now slightly gaping at me. He finally regains his professionalism and says, “Well I’m sure we can do something about that.” He gets up, walks over to his desk, and pulls out a few coins. Baffled, I watch him pour them into my palm. He says, “That’s all it takes,” and smiles. But not in a good way. Actually, it looks more like a leer. I look into my palm and back at him, and see the strangest look in his eyes. And then an eerie red glint. Once again I shiver. Then I blink and find myself wearing a light jacket, sitting in the snow. Which is all I can see for miles.

The Mother and the Businessman emerge on the ground floor.  They see the Captain and Flight Attendants approaching the glass entrance doors to the hotel.

The doors are locked.

The Captain futilely bangs against the glass.

“Have you seen my daughter...?”

The aircrew turns as the Mother and Businessman approach.

Older Flight Attendant: “We haven’t seen your daughter, hon.  We’re locked in.”

Suddenly, through the glass doors—

The Daughter runs across the parking lot as if being chased.

The Mother rushes the glass, starts banging against it, hollering her daughter’s name.  The Businessman pulls her away, draws his gun and starts shooting at the glass.  Spider web cracks splay out from each bullet impact but the glass remains intact.  He kicks at the shattered glass but it won’t budge.
The Older Flight Attendant begins to break down.  “What are they doing to us...?”

The Mother turns back toward the lobby.  Notices a door marked

SECURITY ROOM

She heads for it...

● ● ●

A small bank of monitors sits in the windowless security room.  This is not the same surveillance room we saw earlier.  These are not the same cameras we’ve been viewing throughout.  They cover far less ground, with far lower quality.

The Mother and the Businessman investigate the room alone.

The Mother shakes her head.  “This isn’t it.”

“What do you mean?”

“These aren’t the surveillance cameras from the rooms.”

“You think there’s another security room in here?”

She notices a section of wall where the paint doesn’t match.  She presses her hands against it.  Lays an ear against the flat surface.  The wall opens like a sliding door, revealing darkness.

● ● ●

Out in the lobby, a quick series of white flashes pulse silently through the windows.  The Captain and Older Flight Attendant look stunned.  Frozen in place while kneeling by the Younger Flight Attendant.

The Younger calmly rises to her feet.  Starts to walk back toward the elevators.

The Captain and the Older rise and follow her.  As if they were all sleepwalking.

● ● ●

The Mother and the Businessman enter the hidden chamber beyond the false security room.  The only light source spills from the room they just left.  In the darkness, this seems to be a large storage area that’s been poorly kept.  They stumble over debris as they head deeper into the space.

“What is this...?”

Overhead lights suddenly flicker on, revealing the nature of the space.

A lab.  Or a butcher shop.

Bleached human skeletons litter the floor and a series of metal tables.  Large, hand-drawn diagrams of deconstructed human anatomy plaster the walls, accompanied by mysterious symbols.

The Mother tries to back away from the horror but there’s nowhere to turn.  “What are they doing here...?”

Another hotel staff member is suddenly standing at the entrance.  Wearing a security uniform.  Face in shadow, stock-still.

The Businessman pulls his gun – unloads his entire clip into the man...

The bullet-ridden security guard stands for a moment longer as the smoke settles.  Then drops to his knees before collapsing on his face.

The Mother looks down at the body in horror.  Looks up at the Businessman.  “You killed him.”

The Businessman stares at the body, uncertainly.  He stammers, “He was one of Them.”

“How do you know that?!”

“He looked like one of Them...”

The Mother elbows the Businessman in the gut.  He doubles over and his glasses fall to the ground.  She steps on them as she runs out of the room.

● ● ●

Back in the lobby, the others are gone.

The Businessman clumsily chases after the Mother, his broken glasses in one hand and his gun in the other.  “Angela, wait...”

“You stay the hell away from me.”  She backs up against the locked glass doors.  Behind her, we see hotel staff members emerge from the darkness of the parking lot.  Keeping their distance as they peer in through the glass doors.

The Businessman advances, squinting without his glasses.  “I thought he was going to hurt us... he could have hurt us...”

Just off to the side of the lobby, in a waiting lounge... the sudden roar of fire.

A dormant fireplace has lit up with a fresh pile of burning wood.

The Daughter sits in a reclining chair before the fire, numbly staring into the flames.  She’s soaking wet.

The Mother rushes to her.  “What did they do to you??”

The Daughter speaks with a measured cadence: 

“I’m all right, mom.  Everything’s going to be all right.  They want us to stay a little longer.”

Pulses of white light flood through the windows...

● ● ●

The Captain lies alone in his room.  Eyes open.

The Flight Attendants lie in their beds.  Eyes open.

The Mother and Daughter lie in their bed.  Eyes open.

The Businessman in his room.  Eyes open.

Staff members emerge from the corners of each room.  From closets.  From darkness.  From the edges of surveillance camera frames.  Some emerge from beneath beds.  They all wear varying staff uniforms.  A longer look at them betrays something that’s not quite right.  As if their flesh were a costume that doesn’t fit.  Their faces are fixed masks, obscured by shadow.

Some are holding strange operating tools.  The curious sound of children’s laughter rises again... but it’s not really children’s laughter after all.  It’s the alien sound of their communication.  As it grows in volume, it sounds nothing like laughter.  It sounds like a nightmare.

The bullet-ridden security guard limps into the Businessman’s room, his back to the camera.  He raises a long scalpel and makes an incision in his own forehead.  With both hands, he strips the damaged human body off of his frame... revealing a thin, gray creature with spindly limbs.

The figures slowly close in on the hotel guests, who remain in a trance through the entire harvesting operation.

Surveillance cameras black out.

● ● ●

Morning breaks.

The Mother and Daughter sleep soundly as the dog leaps onto the bed and starts licking their faces.  They both stir toward consciousness.  Well-rested.

The food cart sits beside the bed with a half-eaten burger and a few leftover fries.  The television broadcasts a local weather report.

The Daughter turns toward her Mother.  “When did we fall asleep last night?”

The Mother smiles and shrugs.  “We probably needed the rest.”

The Daughter absently rubs a small scar on her abdomen.

Down in the lobby, everything is exceptionally normal.  Some hotel staff calmly replace a broken glass door.  The Mother and Daughter drag their suitcases toward the front desk and drop off their key card.  The Daughter notices a small bald patch on her dog’s head.  “When did you hurt yourself, girl...?”

The Businessman is at the front desk beside them, settling his bill.  He adjusts his pristine glasses as he notices the mother and daughter.  He nods hello at them but they are in their own world.

They pass by the Captain and Flight Attendants.  No one seems to remember or acknowledge each other.  They all wear a similar dull, dazed expression as they shuffle toward the exit.  This hotel is a way station in the middle of nowhere.  No one stays here for longer than one night and a stay here invariably means you’re still a long way from your final destination.

A family of four walks into the hotel lobby, hauling luggage.  A young couple and their two young children.  By the worn-out expressions on their faces, they look like they’ve been traveling for days without a rest.
The children gravitate toward the circus-themed pinball machine in a corner.  They slap the flipper buttons a few times before realizing that the machine is dead.

The parents head to the front desk to check in.  A temporary spot to rest, under the protection of strangers.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1371111862.0,,,True,t3_1g98yb,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g98yb/menagerie_part_4_end/,

It was really quite simple and you’ll hate yourself for not figuring it out, like I did. You start at the beginning and you end at the end. Start and go down the list, then end your quest. I have found out many things on my quest, but the most important things were found out in the beginning. Five hundred thirty-eight. No more, no less. Legion is a lie, a trick, and is to be ignored. Searching for five hundred thirty-nine or five hundred forty will doom you to failure. So will following bad advice, but as each one dies, I learned from their failings. The lives of others are a small price to pay for ultimate power and ultimate power is a small price to pay for ending this existence, my existence, your existence. Such a small price for such a huge reward, wouldn’t you agree? Don’t worry, we’ll all be dead soon enough, or worse. Ha ha! Won’t that be fun? Pain beyond imagination for all eternity, suffering together as our very souls are ripped apart. I’m on my way right now. I have the final object. It is time to bring them all together. Goodbye everyone, see you in hell, or not! The excitement is titillating.


The man traveled to the place where the other objects were kept. 537 everyday objects that held great power that yearned to be joined again. The object in the man’s hand started to vibrate with energy. He didn’t dare look at it, that would cause what little bit of his sanity he had left to leave him. But at this point he was a shell of his former self, the madness within him is all that kept him going. It also gave him an urge to destroy that even Azathoth, circa Lovecraft, would be proud of.

The man got closer and closer to the other objects, laughing as he did. He opened the door and went inside. Closing the door, he stared at the other 537 objects, and smiled to himself. This was it, this was the end. He felt like a god as he stared at those, more or less, mundane items. “No time like the present is there?” The man said before running and jumping into the pile of objects. When he did he felt them pulse with power and a gleeful smile covered his face. At long last, he would bring the end to everything! Not because he hated people or hated himself, he simply had the power to do so. That was reason enough.

Seconds went by, then a minute. The objects had reached a peak, but then slowly the energy faded. The man was confused. This shouldn’t be happening! He was sure he had done everything right, followed everything to the letter. He had obtained all the items in the right order, and ignored all the fakes, how could this happen? Now! After all his work, power was nothing if you didn’t make people suffer!

“Confused are we?” 

The man whipped around, and stared at a young child wearing a white suit, smirking at the confused man.

“Who the hell are you kid?” The man asked.

“My name is TK, but I’m not a kid, not really. I just borrowed this body; think of it as…my avatar. You should be familiar with that term, right Mr. Seeker?” TK asked.

“S…seeker? How do you know that term?” The man asked.

The child smiled again, “I know a lot of things Mr. Seeker. Like why your collection didn’t destroy the world in a way ‘more horrifying then you can imagine!’ Would you like me to tell you why?” 

“How do I know I can trust you?”

“You can’t. I know I wouldn’t if I was a dirt child like yourself, but hey, it’s up to you. Listen or don’t, ‘your fate have been sealed!’ Ooga booga booga.” The child said mockingly.

“Brats shouldn’t talk that way to their betters you know.” The man said, anger creeping into his voice.

“Then why are you?” The child said, picking up a random item from the pile and staring at it with his back to the man.

“Hey leave those alone! I worked hard for those.”

“Really?” The child said, jumping up from the pile and waving a hand as all of the items disappeared, “then you must really hate me now, huh, Mr. Seeker?”

“NOOOO! What have you done! I’ll fucking kill you!” The man yelled running at the kid, who simply waved a hand as if he were shooing a fly, as the man flew back into a wall breaking his spine and paralyzing him from the waist down.

“I always wondered about hate. It is an emotion I don’t feel. I don’t act out of malice you know. I simply don’t care. You can relate with that can’t you Mr. Seeker.”

The man groaned as he stared at the child who was walking closer to him, and for the first time in a long while, fear entered his eyes.

“What did you mean? Why didn’t it work?” The man asked

“Oh, that’s easy. You’re missing two objects.” The kid said.

“What? No, that isn’t true. There are 538 objects, 539 and 540 don’t exist; they’re fakes!”

“No, the pages on the objects are fakes. But they both exist. I happen to be object 539. Not this child’s body, but me, what I truly am.”

“And what’s that?”

“The second fist and last.”

“I…I don’t understand.”

“No…you wouldn’t would you? Dirt children are so dumb sometimes.”

The man, despite himself huffed at what the kid was saying, “OK, so if you are the 539th object, what is the 540th object? If all but one was collected here, where is the last item?”

“Shouldn’t you be wondering where all of the items are at this point?” 

“Just fucking tell me you brat! What is the last object? I’ll start over, I did it once, and I’ll do it again.”

The boy smiled a large, mocking, smile at the man. “OK, Mr. Seeker, I’ll tell you before I send you on your quest. The final object is God.”

“God? As in a bible or something?”

“No. As in the actual creator of you and your pathetic little mud ball of a planet.”

“I…have to find God to bring about the destruction of reality?” The man asked stunned.

“Actually each separate universe has its own set of 538 objects and they are all different. You seekers try to bring them together but it is a fruitless quest because all the objects in the same universe would destroy that reality, no matter where they were. They don’t even have to be on the same planet, let alone in some guy’s apartment. I, like your creator, dirt child, am everywhere. The objects were actually created to try and destroy me, and were made in every single universe in reality, which is actually a first. But I don’t care what happens to you, my creations, or even myself. So, your creator, in his infinite ‘love’ for his playthings, left reality in order to save his foolish children. That left you wide open to what you call sin, the efforts of the fallen one…and to me. If I wished it, I could destroy all of you.”

The man stared at the boy, stunned for a long time before asking, “then why don’t you?”

“This might be an alien concept to you, but I actually keep the deals I make.”

“What does that mean?”

The boy just smiled at the man. “Who knows Mr. Seeker. THINK FAST!”

The man’s arms jerked up as the boy tossed an object to him. He looked down at it. It was the last object he had collected. The man felt like he couldn’t breathe. He looked over at the boy who simply smiled at him as the pain grew.
“And now, Mr. Seeker, you get to be one of my creations. A wraith who will be in unimaginable pain. Do pay attention now, this is important. You feel this way for everything that was ever lost, and you are going to go find it, Mr. Seeker. But you will feel particularly drawn to the others who have the objects that you spent so much time looking for. You’ll go after them, terrify them, but also entice more to search for the objects, and you, with your story. You’ll become a walking nightmare.”

The man, spiteful now, laughed despite his intense pain. “And how will they know that?”

“Don’t worry; I already have someone to spread what I want him to. He’ll do what I ask, he learned that when we first met. You’re story will be told and will spread fear. Even those who don’t believe or mock it will have it in their minds, eating at their sanity.

The pain overtook the man and he could feel them, not just the 538 objects in this universe, but the 538 objects in every universe. Each was a white hot pain, but along with them was every single item that had ever been lost, yearning to be found again, by somebody, anybody.

“W-why….TK….?” The man asked pitifully as tears ran down his face.

“Because I’m the Terror King,” the boy said calmly. 

He turned to leave the apartment. As he stepped through the door, his clothes changed from a white suit to clothes any normal boy would wear. The man felt a new presence, once that overwhelmed him, one that spread to every universe he could feel, and he knew who…what it was. It was TK, the Terror King, going back to watch over us as we suffered.

Every evening, the sun relieves my eyes from revealing the world around me and lets my mind take over. Every evening, I see that same toothy frown. 

In the dark second-story window of an apartment on my route, I've always been curious as to what exactly is making that terrible grimace. It's probably just some doll or perhaps a painting; though, benign as I'm sure it is, I have to say it certainly sends shivers down my spine to look at it. Large human teeth stretched almost halfway across the window-pane. It's an absolutely massive mouth for any person or animal I've ever seen and so I'm sure it's just a toy, but... Who would make a toy that simply frowns all the time? I wonder if that's why the owner has left it facing outside. I can hardly bare to look at it from the street; I couldn't imagine how terrible it looks up close. Why then, would he keep it? A family heirloom? Yes, that must be it. It's nothing more than some old doll passed down through the generations and the owner couldn't bare to part with it.

What is it, though? I've seen it dozens of times I know, but I could never figure out precisely what it's supposed to be. The street lamps will be lit soon and by that time, I'm sure it will be too dark to get a good look. It's too late to bother the family inside, so perhaps I'll just take a few steps closer to inspect it and be on my way. However, it's the strangest thing... As I get closer, the frown seems to get larger. Not just by reference but it seems to be stretching farther across the window... Could it be alive after all? No, that's silly. It sits so still in the window, surely my mind is just playing the same old tricks, but... there's something more. Strange details appear to be taking shape under the frown. I should get closer.

The lamps are being lit one-by-one now. The first illuminates the street just enough so I can still see the grimacing teeth spanning the window. I take a step closer but still, it's so dark. Another is lit and I can see the glimmer off of those strange details around it. I cross the street but in this darkness, I fear that no matter how close I get, I'll never figure out what it is. I'm becoming so curious, however, that it's almost hypnotizing. The frown gets larger and seemingly more sinister and I swear I can just make out the details on its face. I feel as though I'm just starting to make sense of it, but... Well, now I can't see anything! I look around and my vision is beginning to fade. I'm afraid I'll lose consciousness any second so I try to look for someone to help me but nothing is there except complete and utter darkness! The whole world seems to fade away and just as I'm about to panic, I suddenly feel so sluggish; so... drowsy.

I regain my senses to a terrible headache and blurred vision but slowly, very slowly, my eyes begin to correct themselves. I think I can see the street lamps again but they're... behind the window pane? Clearer still and in the window, I see what appears to be a man staring at me but it's all upside down. The street, the lamps, the buildings are all upside down! Everything is still too fuzzy make out the face of the man, but staring at each other, he straightens his tie while a smile creeps across his face. He begins to walk away and I try to ask him for help but I can't seem to move a single muscle in my body! I'm forced to wait for what seems like hours, upside down and completely paralyzed until someone finally comes along. I must get his attention, but no matter how hard I try, it seems I can only barely move my lips.

Perhaps if I smile at him...",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1363145518.0,,,True,t3_1a6zu9,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1a6zu9/turn_that_frown_upside_down_final/,

I'm making this in case something happens to me, but also to record my progress in this investigation. If something does happen to me, I want this to be published so that someone else can pick up where I left. I don't want my name to be shown.

I live in a small town called Hollowside. The place is next to (and named after) a large forest, the Hollow woods. The older folk who have lived in the town for all their lives say that the forest got the name from its trees. A long time ago there were old, hollowed out trees in the forest. When it was windy, the trees would make a howling sound that could be heard throughout the forest. Those trees were later cut down to clear space for new trees and plants. Some were left for the animals to live in, though.

Now that you have an idea about how the place is, it's time to tell you the reason I'm writing this. Two nights ago, I heard screaming from within the forest. It was late and everyone else was sleeping or just inside. I was outside to walk my dog, so I might be the only one who heard it. It gave me a fright, and I hurried back inside the house. It was windy that night, so I thought it might have been the hollow trees making noise. The next day I had already forgotten about what I heard that night. I went out as usual and talked to some people, walked my dog and went shopping. I went to buy food first, as I always do. I walked into the store, and greeted the owner's son. He works there sometimes, when his father is away at the nearby city. When I had done my shopping, I walked out and saw a car there. It was the store owner's car. I walked back in and asked the boy where his father was. ''What?'' He said. I repeated the question and he said ''I've never met my father, I've told you this before.''

I went home confused after that exchange, and just thought about what he meant until nightfall. It was late, and I had to walk the dog. Nobody else was awake, as usual. It was quiet. Instead of taking my usual path around the town, I went for a walk through the forest. It wasn't as dark as one may thing, the moon was shining through the leaves and branches, setting a surreal atmosphere. There were no animal sound, just my footsteps and the panting of my dog. Suddenly I head movement from behind me. I turned around and saw nothing, just a hollow, dead tree. I kept walking and finally got back home again. I fell asleep almost immediately after jumping into bed.

I was woken up by my dog barking at about 3am. I yelled him to stop, but she didn't. I was about to get up, and heard her voice move farther. I sprinted downstairs and to my horror, saw that the door was open. I must have left it open after I came home. I ran outside in nothing but my bathrobe and screamed her name. I could still hear her barking in the distance, but saw no trace of her. Then, the wind got stronger. The trees started swaing and howling, and drowned any sound made by me, or my dog. By the time the wind stopped, it was silent. I was scared for her, but I assured myself she would find her way back. Maybe she was just chasing a rabbit or some other wild animal.

The next day I woke up to a voice calling my name. I got up and went downstairs. My neighbour was there. ''I came to check on you since your door was open. Are you alright? I thought it might have been a break-in.'' I told him I was fine and asked if he had seen my dog, since she had ran away. He said no. ''I didn't even know you had a dog. If I see a dog I'll tell you.'' He left and I started my day. It was weird not having my dog around. She usually woke me up, so I had already slept through half the day. I ate and got dressed, then I went outside. I decided to go talk to the store owner's son again. What he had said the previous day was really bugging me. Instead of him, there was the owner's wife. I thought nothing of it and asked her where her husband was. ''Are you making fun of me?'' I must have looked very confused because she stopped smiling and said with a puzzled look, ''You know I'm not married. Are you tired or something?'' I thought she was messing with me, that it was a prank of some sort and just laughed it off. After doing my shopping I asked her why she was attending the shop instead of her son. ''Is this another one of your stupid jokes? It's not funny you know.'' For a second I had this stupid grin on my face, but it quickly faded when I saw her serious, almost insulted look.

I asked around and nobody seemed to remember the store owner or his son, everyone said that the owner's wife had always ran the store alone with some paid assistants. She had never been married, she had never had children. Right now I feel like I'm in the fucking twilight zone, something terrible is going on in this town. How can two people be wiped from the history of this town in a matter of days? I'm going to keep looking into this, and I'm keeping this diary to record my process. If this memory loss can happen to anyone, this diary should help me keep track of things if it happens to me.

Dont beat me up over it.",keagator,12,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1900gc/the_coin_a_story_i_just_wrote_its_actually_my/,"   I'm laying in bed writing this, my hands shaking and my breathing heavy. I know its there, watching, waiting for me to move. Let me fill you in on my living hell. 


   Before all this...this crap started, I had a wonderful life. I had the best girlfriend and the most loyal dog. Three weeks ago my girlfriend (Chelsey) and I went on a camping trip. While on our trip we came across this cave in the middle of the woods. Being curious, I wanted to explore it. We went inside and I wandered off a little. In this narrow rock formed room, there was a hole in the roof putting a spotlight of this coin. Now if I could go back in time and do things differently, I would. I really fucked up. I grabbed the coin and examined it. It was rusted and had weird etchings in it. I thought it was cool and took it. As soon as I picked it up, the quiet forest roared with birds flying to a new resting place. 


   That night while I was laying down thinking about the coin and where it could have come from. My thoughts were halted by the noises I heard outside. ""They're only animals, you are in the woods after all,"" I told my self, but deep down I knew I was wrong. 

   The next day I went back to my place and Chelsey went back to hers. When I got home I couldn't wait to see my best friend waiting for me. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see next. I opened the door and right there, right by my feet was my dog. Dead. The only thing I could see wrong with him was his eyes, or lack of. There were just dark pits where his eyes would be. I buried him later that day and out of fear, told everyone that he died of natural causes. He was old after all.

   After this incident, everything was normal. Until earlier tonight. My girlfriend called me, and was panting of the phone. I asked what was wrong and in between breaths she told me she was followed home from walking from work. She said the figure was unhumanly and the only thing she could think of doing was running. I knew these incidents had something to do with that stupid coin. I should have never grabbed it. I went to nearest bridge and there it off the side into the water. All is fine now, right? I thought to myself. Man, was I wrong. 

   When I returned home I called Chelsey up and asked if she wanted to come and spend the night at my place after what had happened. She agreed to it. We both had a long day so we quickly crawled into bed and dozed off. 

   Around three in the morning I had woken up to find Chelsey not by my side. I figured she went to the bathroom or something till I heard something unreal, the noises I had heard the same night we were camping. I feel something watching me but I can't force myself to look up. I'm sitting here typing my story to you. I know I need to take a quick glance.
I looked up. I saw my girlfriend in the door way. The most messed up thing was her eyes. My dogs eyes were in place where her eyes should have been. 

   Whatever that thing is knows I have gotten rid of the coin, and now it wants to get rid of me.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1361568645.0,,,True,t3_1900gc,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1900gc/the_coin_a_story_i_just_wrote_its_actually_my/,

Even now as I type this, I can't seem to break away from this habit. My fingers still seem to search for these stories, the horror of the dieing, twisted, mangled bodies, the evil chasing and the pain and fear of these ""Creepy pasta's"". To this second I still listen to them, watch the videos, read the stories, the joy and fear I feel, the chill of my blood as I plunge ever deeper into the sick twisted world of fear the human mind can create, but you're probably wondering what I'm talking about, let me start from the first encounter with this evil creation.

I was searching youtube, and stumbled across Jwizz if I recall his name correctly and his video about the haunted Lavender town. And as I listened to his explanation of this creepy pasta, my future was forever sealed into this twisted human creation. I shuddered at the thought of this creation, this... thing, that showed how sick and twisted the human mind can become. but I digress, I had moved on, for a time life seemed off, as I walked down the street a few days later to hangout with some of my friends It seemed as if my mind was wandering into this dark realm, searching for these signs that I was among the creepy realm of death and gore that these creations inhabited, my vision tunneled and I was starting to get freaked out... I had awoke a few hours later in the hospital, my friend's Sean and Diego by my side saying I had a seizure and they had found me by the sidewalk, unconscious and bleeding from my head, as if I had fallen and smacked my head into the concrete sidewalk. I glanced around the room and for a split second I thought I caught a glimpse of some dark figure in the corner of the room. Ignoring what I thought to just be a symptom of my waking up from a deep sleep, I began to explain to them what I had stumbled across, and after a bit of conversation, the name ""Yuriofwind"" surfaced. and after being released and taken home, I had turned on my computer and checked Facebook, to see if I had any messages, as per my usual routine and I had received a message from someone named Ben Drowned. I had laughed thinking it was a friend of mine sending me a message, to play a joke on me. but to my despair it was no simple trick, it was just a link to the wiki of this story, and after reading it. I had come to the conclusion that this is something I may enjoy checking out, and after looking up Yuriofwind on youtube, I had fallen into something I would never come out of, Mario, Sonic.exe, Squidwards Suicide, Haunted Silver, all of these stories had fascinated me beyond normal reason. I had begun to dream of these stories, As if I were to live them over and over, an endless night of pain and torture and I was dumb enough to search ever more into this culture of fear. 

At the start I mostly stuck with the PoKeMoN Pasta's at first. They always interested me, a world of ghosts and animals with abilities beyond possible human nature seemed like a good start to try and scare myself silly. I started with PoKeMoN creepy black. The thought of a PoKeMon that could kill anything and everyone in it's path was an cool concept, but the destruction and pain it left in it's wake caused me to question the possibility of such a game's existence...... And then I found the rom.

After Installing the rom and playing the full game I went into a state of shock and fear, even though I knew it was a fake game and none of it was real I felt like I had done something wrong. I laid down in bed and tried to forget and relax, I drifted into sleep unknowingly I had a dream of Ghost form the Creepy Black version, fighting me, he used curse again and again, but for some reason it had no effect, I had grasped him, which was strange, he was a ghost, you're not suppose to grab them, but for some reason I was able to grasp him and as I did, it froze, and then it phased out, and then I fell into a dark never ending hole, and as I was falling I was enveloped in a dark and evil aura. I could sense it's malicious intent and it whispered ""We have you"" and I jumped up from my sleep like you usually do in dreams you have before you hit the ground. I looked over at my computer that had turned on, strange as it was I couldn't sleep so I went back to the internet and started searching on any reactions to some of these creepy pastas, however nothing seemed to surface. I had moved on seeing as I was just having a bad day or so it seemed, I proceeded to start up some Minecraft, maybe a little gaming could clear my head. Everything started normally, The game loaded, my mods seemed in order (I played with the direwolf20 pack) and I joined my server world where all my friends and I played, it was saved on my computer, so no one messed with it, everything seemed normal, so I grabbed some torches and my Ruby pickaxe and went mining. After about an hour or so the server messaged me ""Herobrine has Joined the game"" I stared in disbelief at the console. It showed 2 players on the server, but no one knew my server I.P. except my friends And you can't change your Minecraft name without buying an entirely new copy!
Needless to say I was stunned. I closed my Minecraft almost instantaneously! I decided that I might just be needing to fill a craving I couldn't understand so I watched some more video's about some creepy pasta's. Mainly I entered Sonic.exe And for once, this was one Creepy pasta that I just fell In love with. When I first played sonic he fell into my heart, he will always have a special place there, but seeing him as the blood loving murderer this story made him out to be just filled a need I always seemed to have, seeing my favorite video game character turn into this gore loving animal, started to jolt me into some form of uncontrollable joy. I was like a psychopath! I downloaded the rom and played it, even though in the far reaches of my mind, I seemed to know something was brewing, I was going to end up in the same boat as those who suffered at the hands of this creation of hell. 

After completing the game, I felt comfortable again, though the sun was rising, I crawled back into bed. I should have went to get some breakfast. My mind wandered yet again, watching Tails and Knuckles get massacred by the hyper sonic speed demon, it was almost too much to bare, what I seemed to enjoy almost disturbingly during my time awake, haunted me almost to the point of madness in my sleep, something had to give and my sanity seemed like the best option. I awoke when the sun was setting, my eyes were sore and red from tears streaming down my face during my horrible nightmare. I felt the pit of my stomach catch on fire as if I had been stabbed multiple times with some jagged piece of glass, like in my dream. My sense of reality was beginning to crash around me, but I couldn't stop myself, I had to keep going. My fate was finally sealed.

Months went by, I had locked myself in my room, only leaving for food and the bathroom, I had dropped out of school, my grades had plummeted,  rendering my life in the foreseeable future possibly doomed, but day after day I searched for creepy pasta's I couldn't stop myself, it was like a drug, driving me on and on to never stop, it was something I couldn't control, a never ending drive for some sick, twisted satisfaction that wouldn't stop till it was met. Days and nights blended together. The world seemed to ignore me, friends came by to check if I was still alive, my parents had lost all hope for me and left me to my own devices, they always checked on me, and while I seemed fine on the outside, inside I was nothing but a sick, empty hallow shell, filled with horror and pain, grief that could never leave my physical body...

And that's when I found myself sitting in my room, with a knife held to my wrist. Hoping that the blood I shed would somehow clear my senses, but it only landed me in the Bay Care Mental Health Hospital, where I had 3 months of counseling. My mind had all but left me, and what replaced it was something far from the normal human thoughts, but a shell filled with hate and pain, disturbing images and violence, I would lash out at anyone who would try and help me. I didn't need help, I only needed to fill my desire. These stories drove me mad, when I slept I went to a place far beyond your normal dream realm. I went to what I call the beyond. It was filled with everything I feared and craved, the gap between awake and sleep was almost seamless in this insane. But this is only the beginning, My life was at the command of this ever existing force. We view it as a simple joke, something to enjoy for a good scare, something to question, Is it real? could it be real? Most of us would say no, the possibility of games and shows, stories and myths to come alive is viewed as silly by most everyone. But people like me. those who know, that no matter how much we are blinded by the illusion of what is real and fake, we know that there are some oddities that just seem to avoid all possible explanations. And this is just the beginning my friends, my story is still at it's early stages. Maybe I can finish it. but until then, keep an open mind.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_18dbbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/18dbbh/a_never_ending_nightmare/,

Oh, Necropolis how you taunt me. I walked endlessly through the streets and saw nothing, it was empty. Roads are cracked, the weeds and grass grow but they are spotted black or brown in places. The buildings themselves are an echo to a glory that was not my own. What struck me odd is that there were no road signs, no traffic lights. The paint from the concrete had already *f*aded away. The buildings were not labeled. *I* could only guess that what this area functioned as. The temperature was temperate. The wild was mild. It's like this place was forgotte*n* by humanity. Perhaps it was that this place just... forgot humanity existed. There's not even a broken down car to show that a civilization even existed. I wandere*d* through a slew of buildings that morning. It seemed that I was in some sort of shopping center? There was one building right off that struck *me* as out of place. Hell, it was out of time even.

The building was an odd half-square half-circle totally ma*d*e of stone. Hopping over the counter I entered the workplace are*a*. There was a square like stone... oven of sorts. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Four walls were built up around a pit that was a big in the middle. Dust and ash lay in the bit and o*dd*ly four anvils were nearby. It looked like something out of those “villages trapped in time” sort of deals. Ha, the iron*y*, I get it now.

After exploring that building *I* felt like it was time to check out that bar. It was getting late and I *want*ed to see it in the light. The night around here is ominous and very foreboding. From my room I can hear the wind screaming in the nigh*t* down the streets. H*o*wling it is, that's the word. The wind howls at the shutters and curses at the doors. So I did.

The place was called “E*l*ysium” and it had no front door. Yep. No front door. The hole in the wall where I could see was apparently the east side of the building, it was just big enough for me to poke my head in a bit. Like I mentioned before the pole was on the north side of the building. The stage rose up about three or so feet and charred into what I think was rotten wo*o*d was “Elysian Field #3”. That's when I noticed that the wind had died and there was a *ve*ry very tune in the air.

I had to find this sound. It came from the other side of the corner. Well, this intersection was weird, it made an X rather than a +. There was even a little median in the middle where grass grew. The median was, oh I don't know, three or four feet. I digress. The sound was coming from across the street. The only thing over that way was a very... ver*y* large ruined building. The front of the ruins held a door that had rotted *o*ff it's hinges. There cracks in the walls parts fallen in j*u*st like any where else but the glass here was a bit stronger. It was thick stained glass the color of deep azure.

Stepping over the broken and dusty wood I was reminded of an old cathedral, maybe that's what that place was once. Broken benches made of marble, wood, onyx and some other stones that I couldn't make out doted the place. Although the center of the floor stood a very large black marble table, sturdy. There were multiple chairs crushed and broken around it save three. All near the head of the table. I could hear the sounds, like music from a lost dream or memory, getting louder. I followed it slowly and it led me through the rubble, which of course held nothing of a location or a name, to a mahogany door with one of those brass ball handles has a push button lock on the other side... and it was unlocked.

The door lead to an immediate drop into that same black marble that the table was made of. The music was stronger than ever before. I felt a sense of something like pride when I heard it a proud fatherly feel. One that you get when you are watching your young girl sleep in her room through the camera in a home video. The stairs were steep but long and black. It went down forever it seemed. The light from the door above was just a pinprick of light but as I got closer the I could see the phosphorescent purple-green light from below.

I reached the bottom of the stairs and the light turned out to be mushrooms. Yep. Mushrooms. At least all life here wasn't dead or dieing. Glancing around the room to see what little I could I saw that they covered every inch of wall and ceiling space. Purple-green was dominant here but the further this, I guess... cave I'll call it, I saw blue-white mixed a dark crimson color. Over to the right from where some stone caskets. Most were all broken apart, there was one though that stood erect on left, near where a worked-stoned hall came from.

Stepping down into the room the ground was firm but there was loose dirt here and there. I cautiously moved up to the casket glancing inside. Why did I see? What else? A skeleton … with a giant sword. One of those huge ones like at a renaissance fair. It too glistened with water that trailed down it's blade and oddly it wasn't rusted at all. Good work that.

The music was getting louder, the tune more familiar. Although with it now was a sound that's hard to describe... crack, rip and a snap then silence for a moment and it repeated. Odd I thought so I started heading down the hall slowly. The ground started getting harder and the light smaller due to it become worked stone. Who the hell would work stone down like this!? The cracking sound got louder as I came to a man sized hole in the wall. That's when everything basically hit the fan. What I saw there I hope I always forget.

A man easily as tall as me, over six foot, naked with the head of a dog. A shepherd .. I think, anyway, the sound came from there. It was biting into another man with the same head of a dog that was crucified and hung from the wall. I stood there paralyzed at the site. The creature bit into the inside thigh of the other, breaking the bone and then ripped the flesh off and ate it! I couldn't take it. I ran down the hall a ways and vomited up every bit of what I had inside me twice, it felt like. Steadying myself and wanting to get away from that and closer to this damnable fairy music I started again down the hall. A myriad of sights awaited me. There were more of those dog-man creatures these though had their chests and ribs broken open. Their insides removed and what I found fucked up about it all was that there was a heart drawn on the ceiling of one of the rooms.

After a few broken down halls of this nightmare I found a stone door with another turn-style handle. It opened easily enough and I stepped through. This is what I was looking for. The music box! It was mahogany wood and still playing it's siren like call to me. I approached it of course and I felt from it was .. pride, the pride of a happy father looking in on his young daughter while she sleeps during the night. Caressing the wood, that had to do it I think, I felt dizzy and disoriented. Everything seemed to have paused for lack of a better word and yes, I felt like I could reach out and touch her again. She was so beautiful, so loving and so kind. She and her two friends were always over playing games with each other. It was wonderful.

I looked around the room again. I was in a child's bedroom.... or a midget's love shack one of the two. Against the left wall, west, I think.. no I was sure it was west, how do I know? Does it matter... really? The bed was big enough for me to lay in, not that I did or anything. There was a vanity with a mirror a small little top area to put stuff on and drawers. Moving from one to the other I hit my foot on a length of chain. It was a manacle attached to the leg of the bed. “No worse than anything else I've seen,” I thought to myself.

""He says he wants to be called Sweetie because he needs people to know that he means no harm.""

""No harm?!"" I asked, surprised.

Now, at the time, I was an innocent, frightened ten year old. I'd believe in almost anything you told me. So I believed on Lucy's story right away.

""He doesn't want to be seen as a freak. He says that all he wants is to be understood."" she went on, her face the same.

""He did something horrible, Lucy. How can he possibly want to be understood?"" I was sweating cold.

""He just does."" and she left. I was worried that I had hurt her feelings, but I didn't follow her. I stared at Amy's empty bed, sorrowfully. ""No harm"" I thought. ""Sweetie"". ""Understood"".

I was about to leave the room when I noticed something on the foot of Lucy's bed. It was a piece of paper that seemed like someone had torn out from a notebook. There was writing on it. For all I remember, it said:

*Sweetie came in to see me again. This time, he pointed to my sister Amy, but she didn't see him because she was sleeping. I didn't know what he wanted to say. Amy was out up until late tonight. She said that I couldn't tell Mommy or Daddy. I didn't say anything.*

It was a journal entry on the day we went out on the woods. I didn't even know Lucy had a diary. I looked around. No one was watching. I slowly peered under the bed and looked for more. Success. It was one from the week before.

*He used to scare me, but I think I'm getting used to it. He smiles a lot, and when he does, his cheeks almost touch his eyes. He's all gray, too.*

I shivered. Uncertain of everything, I looked around the room for more, but found nothing. Lucy's room was a mess, and I was about to give up and forget about her story, and admit that she was just making it up, until I tripped over something and fell down.

On further inspections, I noticed it was a school notebook. I picked it up and flipped through the pages. It was the source of the notes I'd found. Ever since I was that age, I was obsessed with Sherlock Holmes mysteries and all the detective stuff, so I felt like I was inside a case. 

On most of the pages it talked about what Lucy had done during the day at school, nothing much of interest. But there was this only one page that talked about Sweetie. It read:

*I saw that thing on my window tonight. I don't know what it is, but it had long fingernails. He used them to carve on my wall the words ""Sweetie?"". I'm scared. I think he's asking me to call him Sweetie.*

I carefully tore the paper out and put it in my pocket. It just looked like I'd need it later. When I heard someone coming, I threw the journal under the bed and got up. It was my mom, coming to tell me we were going home.

I spent hours linking the events. The noise we heard at the woods and the marks on the tree were definitely made by Sweetie. But why was Amy laughing? Did she have any knowledge about him? I couldn't wait any longer. I had to do my research.

I was about to head out to the library and find out some more about that so called ""Sweetie"", when the phone rang. Mom was busy, so she told me to get it. 

When I picked it up, there was heavy breathing. Heavy breathing only. I felt a chill coming down my spine. ""Who's this?"" I asked, nervously.

There was static sound. I wanted to hang up, but felt the need to keep the phone on my ear. I don't know why. So I did. Finally, a very deep, dark but whispery voice said: 

""I hope you remember me.""

Then they hung up.

At first, I thought it was a sick prank, but the same senses that told me to keep on listening to the static told me that it wasn't just a prank.

I tried to look up the number, but it said (null). I had never seen that happen before. The number wasn't blocked. It had somehow... Disappeared, as I used to think at the time. 

Even though I felt a deep frightening sensation, I decided to go to the library already and forget about the call. The cool air of the road made me feel a little more secure.

I asked the kind lady that happened to live a few blocks away from me if she had any books about legends, the supernatural, or whatever. She thought for a second, until I decided to show her Lucy's painting of Sweetie. She stared at it for a couple of seconds, then she became a little bit pale. I asked if she was alright, but she said nothing. All she did was point to a certain section. ""There's something she's not telling me"" I thought. I decided to follow her directions and found an old shelf, filled with old books. I took a small peek at each one, but found nothing of interest. When I was about to give up, I saw a small, dusty dark green book on the far corner of one of the shelves. The title was ""STF"". I didn't know what that stood for. Out of my curiosity, I took it out of the shelf. After I saw what was drawn on the front of it, I almost dropped the book.

It was a nearly identical drawing of Sweetie to the one Lucy had drawn. I opened it, hands pale and shaky. There was a paragraph that said something like this:

*Once you see Sweetie, he is real. Nobody that has seen it in person managed to tell the press about it. He is an evil creature that lives on the darkest of the woods. He is famous for leaving marks with his claws on trees nearby. If he spots you, he'll follow you home and murder you.*

*Murder you* It went back and forth across my head. Sweetie had obviously made it clear that he (or should I say ""it""? Let's go by ""he"") had followed me home and scratched on my window. And Lucy was lying about her naming him. He told/manipulated her into calling him that. And now he'd yank MY eyes out. My whole body shook with fear, but I knew that if I wanted to stay alive, I needed to focus.

As I exited the big library, the librarian looked at me, with that same pale face of hers and said:

""Be careful with what you get involved into.""

I knew exactly what she meant.

I entered my house, making mental notes to myself. I was surprised on seeing my mom and Paul looking at an old family album.

""Dear, come look at this!"" she called out for me.

There were some pictures of me and Paul as toddlers, Mom and Dad on a boat when we were about five, Me holding Paul for the first time, etc. But there was something unsettling about the pictures.

""Mom, what's that thing next to my crib?"" I asked, pointing at something that looked like a Freddy Krueger glove.

""That might have been your dad, just messing around"" Mom said, trying to smile.

But as I looked at some other pictures, that ""glove"" seemed to appear over and over. But when we came across a Christmas picture, in which everyone was in front of the glowing tree, I felt my heart skip a beat.

Right behind that Christmas tree, stood a dark grey creature, covered with fur. All that was visible was his two wide, oval eyes, his bright hellish smile and his long, pointy claws that hung from his paws.

1345348417.0,9,self.creepypasta,ygium,My Own Hell,Remag,13,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/ygium/my_own_hell/,"I woke up in darkness. There was nothing around me but sand. Nothing to comfort me but the sounds of the sandstorm that constantly raged outside of this prison I find myself in. I have wondered the halls for many, many years, but I cannot escape.


“But this isn’t right,” I think to myself.


My memories come and go. I remember when I was alive. I had a family at one time, friends, even children. I was just like you are now.


This is a strange place I find myself in. While I have memories of my own death, I find that I still have a physical body. Although that body has been disfigured from what I remember. I am not sure if I want to see what I look like now or not. All I know is that I am alone in this darkness.


Sometimes the only memories that come to me are bad things I have done. When this happens I think that I must be in hell and this is my penance for what I have done. This can go on for weeks or even months.


This is my own hell.


But then one day something happened. The darkness I lived in was suddenly destroyed by a powerful light. I was blinded by its brilliance. I see a figure blacked out by the light. I think that perhaps my time in this hell is over. Perhaps it is time for me to be reunited with my family after such a long time of being alone.


The image of a person dissolves and soon becomes a demon bathed in fire. 


I hear a voice. But I cannot understand the words.


Then, my world is bathed in fire as the demon burns me with its unholy fire. I try to protect myself from the demon as it approached me. The demon halts for a moment and seems to sniff at the air and while it is distracted I curse this demon for invading my space. In doing so I invoke a power I did not know I had.


 I feel pain shoot through me as if I have suddenly been stabbed…memories from my life come flooding back. I remember by death again. Trying to protect the ones I loved, the murderer who took my life.

Why God? Why am I in this place if my last act on Earth was to protect my family?


The demon roars with pain and rage as my wish to see it harmed comes true.


My plan does not work though. The demon unleashes a powerful blow on me. My physical body can feel itself getting weaker. My last act of defiance is to link my own soul with that of the demon. I I am to be destroyed, this demon shall be destroyed along with me!


But my plan fails. I am again imprisoned, but it was not the demon that did it, it was something else, something worse. 


Now my world is that of twilight. I do not feel the pain caused by the demon. Burned and beaten as I am, there is a strange calmness. 


Time passes, I do not know how long. Time seems infinite here. I have nothing to do but wonder my new prison, but it is endless and all the same. 


Then one day I discovered something. I could remake any place with my mind.


I think of my home, and it sprang up from nothing. My loved ones were around me, it was just like when I was alive. After spending much time here I feel healed from my fight with the demon.


I like it here; perhaps I can now find peace at last.


Then I discovered the sad truth. My family, my friends, my children….they are shadows of their former selves. This isn’t my family or the afterlife, at least not a bright and peaceful one. This is a lie.


I banish it and once again I am in twilight, alone, as I have been for the last 700 years. God, it seems like no time at all for me.


Then I hear it. A called name. A name that sounds familiar although it is not my own…I am thrust back into the real world again.


I stare into the face of another demon, but different than the other. This one is almost humanoid. I again hear  a voice I cannot understand and seemly from nothing I feel the pain of an attack from this new demon. I am hurt, but not badly.


Another voice commands me and I am propelled to listen to it. I unleash a powerful attack on this new demon. It seems I can create balls of energy. I do not know when I learned to do this, just that I can.


Soon the other demon is defeated and I am dragged back into my prison to await the time I am forced to fight for something that now controls me and I am powerless to defend against it or to stop it. I must go on fighting and fighting. I do grow stronger, but never freer.


This is my hell.

Journal Entry: Today while exploring the catacombs in Relic Castle I found a Confagrigus. Using my Emboar I was able to weaken the Pokémon so I could catch it. After I healed the Confagrigus at a Pokémon Center I used it to beat a trainer who was using a Hypno. I hope my new Confagrigus and I will become the best of friends now, though I do wonder if they retain their memories of their past life that their pre-evolution, Yamask, does. Oh well, if that myth is true then it must be great being a Pokémon and battling other Pokémon to become stronger. I hope I get the chance to become a Confagrigus too one day and grow stronger with a power trainer.

Someone once told me that there are things that live in the woods our city
was built upon. They said that creatures have been lurking within the damp
gloom and cool shade of the trees long before we arrived here. I myself have
heard about strange things that have happened just outside of the major
cities that were, to say the least; unexplainable. Worse yet, I have seen
with my own eyes a glimpse of what lies beyond civilization. 


I am from a small community outside of Edwardsville, IL called Holiday
Shores. It is a subdivision built in the middle of nowhere nestled amongst
many fields of corn. The whole community is not quite large enough to be
called a town, and is built entirely around a lake that is big enough for
boating and water skiing. All of the roads are named after some sort of
ocean theme like Sexton, Brigantine, or The Bahamas. It is one of those
super safe rural places where people don't usually lock their doors, and
everyone knows everybody. It was a great place to grow up except the ride to
school was almost 45 minutes, and most of my friends lived closer to the
heart of Edwardsville or in Glen Carbon another neighboring city. 


These are
Southern Illinois towns all very quaint and pristine. 
My parents' house was of on a sort of big hill in the middle of the
neighborhood. At that time in people had some space between themselves and
their fellow neighbor. There was a lot of open land and empty spaces for
things to hide. Towards the side of my parents' house was a big slope with a
patch of trees and weeds that grew along the side of the road. It was my
13th or 14th birthday and they had bought me a bike, the kind that was
probably a size or two too small so I could do stunts. My friend Kyle was
over with his bike, and we were doing what kids do; zooming up and down the
roads on our bikes trying to ride wheelies, and do bunny hops. I don't
remember much of the day and the whole situation to me now seems like some
sort of surreal nightmare. Kyle was at the top of the big slope which was my
families driveway, and I was down by the side of the house getting ready to
turn my bike around and head back towards the driveway. The street lights
had just come on, and the sun was still working on hiding away from the
coming night. 


As I was heading back I heard a cat meowing in the patch of trees along the
side of the road by my house. Being a curious kid and an animal lover, I
hopped off my bike and went to investigate the noise. What I saw it seems my
mind to this day refuses to accept, but I know I saw it. I shudder some now
just thinking about its haunting form. The meowing had come from what
appeared to be a pale white manlike thing. It was completely naked, and
hunched over in the thick of the trees. What I can remember most was the
things back bones jutting from its impossibly white skin. From my
perspective it was hunched forward and crouched over something, with its
back towards me. The mind never stops trying to categorize and make sense of
things the best it can. I think we are in a constant attempt to reason with
what is presented to us in life. What I saw that day made no sense, it was
of no category of creature known to man. My mind has supplemented its face
with a hodgepodge of horror, but its appearance was a nightmarish reality. I
am now 25 and to this day, I still try to come to ground with what I saw and
put back the pieces of this fading phantasm.


The thing wretched it's morbid head my direction, and from its gaunt face,
emitted a second feline meow through a row of small sharp animal teeth.
There was this moment where our eyes made contact, its cat like gaze locked
with mine in a predatory stare. I don't know what expression was in that
cold reptilian like face and I had no intention of examining it further.
Immediately I collected myself, my body almost instinctually responding, I
hopped on my bike and tore back around to the front of my house like a bat
out of hell. Kyle was still at the top of the driveway and he could tell
something wasn't right. Huffing, I explained something was down in the
thicket of trees. I told him to go see it for himself, and I watched as he
went around the corner and brought his bike to a stop. He probably heard it
call to him as well with its libelous cry. He didn't get off of his bike,
but turned around quickly and rushed back in the same manner as I. He saw it
but, we never figured out what IT was. We did not go back to see it that
night, and the next day in the daylight it was gone with no evidence of its
existence.

Do so without reading any other paragraphs and do it now. Please…trust me.

What happens next is entirely your fault. You failed the test and now you’re in danger. I didn’t write this.

They made me write it. It’s my fingers on the keyboard, that’s all, and your eyes on these words. Whatever happens, do not look away from these words. Keep reading until I tell you otherwise. And when I tell you otherwise, do exactly as I say. For if you do not read this exactly how I tell you to, you will die.

Listen carefully. First, you must skip the paragraph that follows this one. Whatever you do, you must never read the paragraph following this one. You must ignore it completely, casting your eyes down to the paragraph that follows it. Promise me, for the sake of those you hold dear. This is your only chance to redeem yourself for not trusting me earlier. Skip the paragraph following this one, and do so now.

The Forbidden Paragraph: You had to do it, didn’t you? They knew you would. Nothing you do now will make any difference. If there are people you love, call them. Tell them whatever people tell their loved ones when they know they’re about to die. Settle any scores. Make your final arrangements. From this moment on, you will stay alive only as long as you can stay awake. The next time you fall asleep will be your last. They’re watching you. They’re listening to your thoughts. They’ll wait for you. And when you fall asleep, they’ll come for you. You should have trusted me.

If you skipped the paragraph above, you’ve done well. But your troubles are not over. For placing your trust in me at the second asking, you have given yourself a chance to live. This is what you need to know. They’re watching you. They’re listening to your thoughts. They’re waiting for you to make a mistake. When you do, they’ll come for you. To stay alive, you must draw blood from someone you love. A drop, that’s all, and place it on your tongue. That’s what they want. That’s what they need. They’re inside you right now. And they’re waiting. If between waking up and falling asleep you fail to deliver the blood of a loved one, you will never wake up again.

It is not cracked or marked in any way, and the smooth black stone reflects even the faintest of light. It’s curved and formed in just such a way that if you are very careful, you can climb on top of it from the side, and stand on a flat area at the top.

If you stand on the rock when the moon is full and shining, and the water is at its highest point, you can see something in the sea below you. A faint shimmer of light, a flash of something you can’t quite identify. It gets brighter, easier to see as you kneel down and lean closer, over the edge of the rock.

Once you are leaning out further than would probably be safe, your left leg will slip on the slippery stone, and you will fall forward into the light. There is no splash, no sound; you simply disappear into the ocean.

No one knows what happens after you disappear. But there are some who claim to have fallen off the same rock, what seems like a lifetime ago. According to the earthly calendar, they were gone for one day, then washed up on another beach, sometimes half a world away. But their eyes are hardened, and they rarely speak anymore, only occasionally muttering of fiery paths and gibbering demons.

1326343385.0,10,self.creepypasta,odhl6,Hell's Pasture (first AND ONLY creepypasta I wrote),Injustice-Shall-Fall,10,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/odhl6/hells_pasture_first_and_only_creepypasta_i_wrote/,"Since I was a young boy, I always wanted to own a farm. The lifestyle appealed to me; with a few seeds you can support yourself and provide sustinance for you and your family, you were close to animals, and generally, you were in a small community. I loved the idea. So, at the age of eleven, after getting my first GameCube, I ventured to WalMart and took a look in the bargain bin for something to fulfill my fantasy.

Lo and behold, I found it in the form of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. It was the last copy and I had my last twenty-five dollars, which, as it was, was just enough. My only real complaint was that the game appeared to have been opened slightly, but my dream would somewhat come true. I had my farm in my hands.

Eager to start, I sat down to play. Everything started as normal, Takakura narrating while I watched the game unfold. I entered in all the names I had planned since I was little: For the farm, I chose the name 'North Farm'. I chose the pointy-eared dog and named him 'Kitsune', thinking A) that he resembled a fox, and B) that it could be affectionately shortened to 'Kit'. Hating my own name, I chose to enter 'Damion' as my own name. I started off with some seeds and a cow, and a few tools, and dived right into the game.

I took great care of my animals as the farm grew, making sure they were all happy and healthy, like I would have if they were my own, real-life pets. I'd place orders for food and tools, and spend whatever time away from the farm either fishing, helping out with the fossil dig, or attempting to woo Celia (I was successful and eventually married). Eventually I would go on automatic, placing the orders and forgetting about them.

So, when Takakura showed up one day with a new Star Cow that I had ordered, I was slightly confused. I couldn't remember ordering another cow. But, I took her in happily, wondering if maybe she was a gift or a glitch, or, perhaps just another order I forgot I had made. I gave her the name 'MuuMuu', and treated her no different than the other animals that I had at the time, and she eventually paid for herself. I was recieving the highest quality Star Milk and it sold for a small fortune.

Eventually though, I outgrew my childhood fantasy, and saved the game for the last time, shutting off the Cube and instead putting in hours on a new XBox 360. The GameCube went unforgotten, collecting dust for years.

Eventually, I got bored with achievement whoring, and started browsing my old collection. I smiled fondly when I pulled out my old copy of Harvest Moon. Thinking nothing of it, I cleaned off the console as best I could and popped that sucker in.

A warning light went off in my head when the title screen appeared. It was the same Forget-Me-Not Village, the same logo, the same 'Press Start' screen. But it was the music that got me first. The music was slow and slightly distorted, and 'clicked' every now and again. I thought nothing of it, perhaps it was just my imagination. I pressed start and loaded my old file. Everything seemed as I had left it all those years ago: North Farm, Kitsune, Damion. I played as if nothing was wrong, putting feed in the boxes and doing whatever needed to be done.

The second warning light came on when I ventured through the town. It seemed less... lively than it used to. It wasn't til after I had played for a while that I realized that it seemed less lively, because they were missing. Half the population was gone. I decided to investigate, the few people I talked to gave me disappointed looks, gave no sound. All that read was '...', but nothing else. No hint, no clue, nothing.

I returned to my farm. Why had all this change come about? I checked my chicken coop, and the sight of it turned my stomach. It was all graphics, yes, but I'll never rid the image from my mind: There was blood on the walls, and feathers strewn about. My crops were all dead. I checked my house: My family was not there. In the stable and pasture, there were no animals, save for my horse, my dog, and my cow MuuMuu.

I didn't get it. What had happened? I paused the game and checked GameFAQs, but nothing like this was written here. I swallowed and unpaused the game.

""Welcome back, Damion."" came a text box. My heartrate increased as I read that phrase. Just who was it that was welcoming me back? I bit my lip and watched the screen terrified as the 'speaker' was brought to my attention. I was outside my house, my horse Repede beside me and my dog in front, barking in my defense.

MuuMuu slowly walked to me. ""Do you like what I've done with the place while you were gone?"" In my horror, the camera panned about: My precious North Farm had gone up in flames. What was happening? The game gave me control again, and I did the only thing I could think of. I hopped on Repede and rode away, leaving behind my dog. I could hear the sound of a dog whimpering, bone and marrow crunching, and a swallowing noise followed by a happy Cow noise.

I had no idea where to go. The hotel? Too close. The dig site? I'd be cornered. I thought quickly... where could I go that this beast wouldn't find me? I made a beeline for the Twins' house. Cows couldn't climb ladders. Unfourtunately, neither could my horse, so I tearily left Repede to the mercy of the cow and climbed up into the house.

I could hear the sound of an angry horse and an angry cow fighting, followed by the death cry of my beloved Repede. There was more munching, more of that horrid, horrid noise. The screen went dark. Then, another text box popped up.

""Milk me. Yes/No""

Confused by this, i chose the no option. The text box appeared again. ""Milk me. Yes/No"" This repeated three, four times. The game wouldn't proceed unless I milked MuuMuu. I gave in.

I checked the milk I had recieved and was shocked at what I had done. In my inventory were five 'Blood Milk'. The description read, 'Special Milk from MuuMuu. It appears thick and red, but full of vitamins. Sells for 0G'

""I came to you because nobody wanted me. You cared for your animals. I wanted to be loved and cared, too. Was that so wrong? Yes/No""

My eyes were misting now, it was pitiable. I chose the 'no' option. I was mentally eleven again. ""You cared for us... you cared for me. I wanted to pay you back. So I made the best milk I ever could."" My mouth hung open as I realized what was happening. ""But you never came back... I got hungry."" She said. The screen faded in, and I was outside the house and talking to MuuMuu. I pressed all the buttons in a panic. Reset, power, I opened the cover. Nothing happened, and the scene kept going. ""You abandonned us... why did you do it? Were we not good enough for you?"" My heart sank.

""No, no! That's not it at all!"" I sobbed, trying to reconcile for what I had done. ""I loved you all!""

""You abandonned us... YOU ABANDONED ME!"" MuuMuu's eyes glowed a demonic red, and she bellowed. ""YOU LEFT US TO STARVE AND DIE! YOU KILLED THEM! NOT ME! YOU'RE TO BLAME!"" She screamed, and a high, mournful sound emitted the TV's speakers, a sound that Hell itself could not replicate. MuuMuu's mouth opened up, revealing all she had devoured: Her teeth soaked in blood, feathers sticking to them. Cow guts and internal workings over her tongue, and her most recent victims: My dog's head inpaled on her tooth, and my horse with a section of stomach missing, revealing his ribs and a hollow corpse. I looked away for fear of vomiting.

""I'M... STILL... HUNNNNGRRRRRYYYYYY!"" She roared. I gasped as control was handed to me for a breif moment, and I opened the rucksack, quickly choosing my sickle. At the last moment I tapped the 'A' button, when it said 'Use'. What happened next was a cinematic that I wasn't entirely surprised about. Damion raised the sickle and, shedding a tear, sliced at MuuMuu, slitting her throat and killing her.

I took a moment to gather myself, and find out what the sweet holy hell had just happened. A new scene started. I was inside Romana's manor, and all the people from the Village were there. Celia came and explained it to me:

""We all hid here, in Romana's basement. We're so glad you're safe! MuuMuu... is she...?"" Damion nodded and looked down sadly. Celia hugged him tight and Damion returned the hug, and he pulled away smiling. The townsfolk cheered, and all was well. I sighed with relief, releasing the breath I had been holding and chuckling dumbly to myself. It was over.

Or so I thought. The game froze, the sound became a mix of white noise and distorted music. Perplexed, I looked to the console and hit reset. The console started fuming and I looked at the screen:

GAME OVER
IN MEMORIAM

I watched hopelessly as the names of my animals and some townsfolk came on this screen of this victim list. After the last name, the screen read, once again,

GAME OVER.

Underneath was a picture of Damion, lying in a pool of blood, a bite taken out of his neck, a foot missing, bone and sinew all over. There was a hole where his heart should have been, and organs were leaking out of a hole in his stomach. I felt I was going to be sick, then the screen began flashing and I seized.

I woke up in my mother's arms, sobbing hard. She looked at me sternly... what happened? My neck hurt and my arms felt heavy. I looked at my arms and my jaw dropped in terror: ""don't forget me don't forget me don't forget me"" was carved in.

The words are still scarred on my body. Since then I have not touched a glass of milk, wore any leather. I destroyed the disc and burned the pieces, and erased my save game. All those hours, gone.

Does anyone remember this kid’s show? It was called Candle Cove and I must have been 6 or 7. I never found reference to it anywhere so I think it was on a local station around 1971 or 1972. I lived in Ironton at the time. I don’t remember which station, but I do remember it was on at a weird time, like 4:00 PM.

YES! Okay I’m not crazy! I remember Pirate Percy. I was always kind of scared of him. He looked like he was built from parts of other dolls, real low-budget.

Sorry to ressurect this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, Skyshale. I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in ‘71, not ‘72. I was 12 and I watched it a few times with my brother. It was channel 58, whatever station that was. My mom would let me switch to it after the news. Let me see what I remember.

It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a little girl who imagined herself to be friends with pirates. The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and Pirate Percy wasn’t a very good pirate because he got scared too easily. And there was calliope music constantly playing. Don’t remember the girl’s name. Janice or Jade or something. Think it was Janice.

Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid’s show?
Thank you Jaren!!! Memories flooded back when you mentioned the Laughingstock and channel 58. I remember the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged. It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful Ed Wynn voice and laugh. I especially remember how jarring it was when they switched from the wooden/plastic model, to the foam puppet version of the head that talked.

Ugh mike, I got a chill reading that. Yes I remember. That’s what the ship always told Percy when there was a spooky place he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was. And the camera would push in on Laughingstock’s face with each pause. YOU HAVE… TO GO… INSIDE. With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened and closed it. Ugh. It just looked so cheap and awful.

You guys remember the villain? He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall, narrow teeth.

That wasn’t the villain, the puppet with the mustache. That was the villain’s sidekick, Horace Horrible. He had a monocle too, but it was on top of the mustache. I used to think that meant he had only one eye.

But yeah, the villain was another marionette. The Skin-Taker. I can’t believe what they let us watch back then.

I’m so relieved that other people remember this terrible show!

I used to have this awful memory, a bad dream I had where the opening jingle ended, the show faded in from black, and all the characters were there, but the camera was just cutting to each of their faces, and they were just screaming, and the puppets and marionettes were flailing spastically, and just all screaming, screaming.

i visited my mom today at the nursing home. i asked her about when i was little in the early 70s, when i was 8 or 9 and if she remembered a kid’s show, candle cove. she said she was suprised i could remember that and i asked why, and she said “because i used to think it was so strange that you said ‘i’m gonna go watch candle cove now mom’ and then you would tune the tv to static and just watch dead air for 30 minutes. you had a big imagination with your little pirate show.”


An AnecdoteEdit

Loved this show. Horace Horrible was my favorite. I remember looking everywhere for his action figure but Kiddie City and KB had never even heard of the line. I finally found a talking Horace, good as new, at somebody’s yard sale, though I didn’t see a house around and never saw those people again. I was pretty excited, and ran right to my friend’s house to gloat.

When his mom answered the door, she let out the most guttural scream I’d ever heard, absolutely scaring the shit out of me. She told me to get lost with “that thing” and slammed the door in my face. My kid-logic concluded that she must have known I bought a toy from a stranger completely unsupervised, and that it must have been an even more serious crime than I thought.

So, I did my best to keep Horace hidden, especially from my own parents, but his voice chip was pretty damn loud, and every so often he’d go off by himself, like his battery was dying. My mom kept asking if Marble (our cat) was in my room…I don’t know how you mistake that goofy chuckling for a cat.

It was subtle at first, but after a few days he started to smell weird. His voice kept getting weaker and more garbled, and his joints kept getting looser like they were ready to drop off. I was afraid of getting caught and we didn’t have trash pickup, so I did what a rational child does when he thinks he has contraband and buried it in the woods.

I never found another one or figured out what was wrong with him, but it’s the weirdest thing; a tree grew where I left him, I shit you not, in just a couple weeks. It never grew leaves and it never got much taller than me, but it’s there to this day, and every summer it swarms with disturbing numbers of flies, wasps and ants.

I was the only child. We weren’t a big commercial farm. Just a family-type thing. We had five cows, three horses, a small herd of goats, two dogs, and one chicken coop. We also had some Indian Runner ducks we kept mostly as pets. We didn’t really make any money off the place, just enough to sustain the animals and a little extra for ourselves. Money enough to take a decent vacation every couple of years. Dad had his other job in town, an insurance agent. He was the only one around really, the town wasn’t more than about 1,500 people. Mom gave horse-riding lessons as well. We weren’t rich, but we were comfortable.


It was really an easy life (or at least it could have been a lot worse), I went to school, Dad went to work, Mom took care of the animals, then we all had dinner together every night, and I would go to bed while Mom and Dad had a beer or two and watched the news. Sometimes at night I would hear things outside. Mostly just normal stuff. The cows or horses would get spooked by a coyote or something, or I would hear the dogs chasing a rabbit, barking their heads off. Every once in a great while we would find a chicken dead. Dad would always tell me about it but never let me see the body, although I asked frequently. He would keep Mom and I inside until he had gone out, did whatever he did with the body, throw sawdust over any blood, and then life would go on as normal. I assumed it was foxes, as I had seen a couple of them out in the pasture over the years, slinking around back and forth through the grass.


The summer when I was ten years old, I remember helping Mom change the bedding in the horse stalls, when we heard a huge racket going on outside. If you’ve never heard the sounds of a horse in pain, you don’t want to, trust me. It sounds almost like a person screaming. Well that’s what we heard, and one of our horses, the palamino, came running into the barn with a wound on it’s left thigh. Four long marks, like claw marks, ran across it’s body for about a foot. It had blood running down it’s leg, and was limping. I was so scared by the sight of that much blood that Mom locked the horse in a stall and made me go inside with one of the dogs. She told me to lock the door and stay inside until she came in to get me. I did.

While driving, we were sharing some scary experiences with each other, It was a fun little hobby I had started with some friends and nothing too bad had come of it.

After a few stories of a faceless woman, odd red auras and others. We came across an old cabin by a lakeside on the highway. We started laughing and we decided to pull over and take a few photos, to share to some friends about how creepy New Brunswick was at night.

We got back in the car, and Frank handed to me his phone, so I could check over the photos, we had took many as to get the perfect quality, and I was curious to how the camera had captured it, on all but one of the photos though, there was this odd humanoid figure popping out from the lake, the camera has a pretty bad night feature, but you can clearly see this in the photos displayed with this text. The figure appears to have a lamb skull, and it also appears to be looking straight at us, with no eyes.

As soon as I see this, I point it out to my Frank, and he begins to freak out. We parked to the side of the road and he begins to tell me of a time when he was young. He had forgotten of this but it all came back to him. 

One night, when he was 4, his sister was babysitting him while his parents were gone to a New Years Eve party, It was near the time he had to go to sleep, so his sister sent him to bed and then she began watching the television.

“I was just about sleeping” he said to me. “But then...” He explained to me that an entity appeared above him, while he heard static, The house suddenly lost power. The figure staring at him, the void in his eyes. He then fainted. The morning after, his sister was nowhere to be found. The parents searched everywhere for her. They called the police, but after 2 weeks of searching for her, they proclaimed her dead.


“How could I forget about that!” He exclaimed. then he started crying. his words were mangled.
I tried comforting him “You were 4 years old, you were probably dreaming, and your sister might have ran away!” I said this to him, knowing fully well about his sister. She often babysat me, our families where friends and she was always so sweet. I had a crush on her myself, but at that age, I was only dreaming and I was a kid being a kid.


We both climb into his truck again, and I quickly deleted all of the photos concerning the cabin. I did this to make my best friend forget. He dropped me off at my place, and he then returned to his. I jumped on the computer, promising him I would talk to him on skype video chat, and play league of legends with him to make the night go by faster.


We had played a couple of games, and we were doing well. But then, it happened. I started to hear static from my headset, brutally loud too. I quickly threw them off of my head as I watched in terror. on my monitor I could see the Goat man holding Franks head. I saw my friends eyes turn black, the same kind of black that where on the face of the being I now call “Goatman”. The Goatman had disappeared, and Frank fell to the floor. I waited for a moment, then I quickly grabbed my keys and drove down to his place. I knocked furiously on his door, No answer. I climbed into his house from a window. I screamed his name in fear. Still no sign of him.


I made my way to his room. The door was locked, so I kicked it down. Terror ran down my spine, he wasn’t anywhere to be seen. I took my phone and I called the police. They sent a dispatch to the address I gave them. I was quickly searching the entire house, when suddenly, I feel remarkable pain in my abdomen. I look down and to my surprise I see a knife peering out of my chest. I fell to the floor. I gasped for air and I turned to see Frank. But it wasn’t him anymore, It was only his body, and shell from who he was before. I was crying. I did not want to die. The only thing he said was “We all want to do these things, I am the being who makes you do the things we all desire” As he was about to impale me one last time. The police shot him 4 times in the chest. and he fell over.


I was taken into the emergency room. Luckily I only suffered from paralyzation from the lower portion of my body. But, he still haunts me in my dreams. This is a warning, if you see a humanoid figure with a goatish head. run, run as far as you can. The Goatman has no mercy.

Signore Gepetto’s Insanity

  All I had wanted….was a son. Yes dear reader, I’d had a son before – but he was too weak.  It was just a simple case of Polio, but how it corrupts the flesh – that failure of the body. I trust you’ve read the fabled story of my experiences with the boy I wanted to be real, a boy of wood who learns the importance of humility – but I don’t think you know why or how it came to fruition and what the real reality of it is or was.
    It had begun simply enough on the dingy streets I had grown used to in my old age –  with all its violence, with all its sadness, and all its death. It was all the same to me, I had not come from the most affluent family – so I couldn’t have cared less about the world around me, especially in Sicily. My wife, her life as a destitute woman with a penchant for gluttony finally catching up with her, died three months before my first encounter with La mafia siciliana2, who would eventually run my life until those cold, cruel days inside the belly of that  blasted whale. Her name was Isabella, but you know her as the Blue Fairy. 
    
   When I began my life as a degenerate carpenter, Isabella had been dead and buried for nearly a year – and that was when I took to staying in my former home, working in the workshop. I would like to say that grief was the driving force in my descent into madness, but I’m afraid it was the isolation. In this isolation, my tools had taken on their own personalities with each passing day, as I fell further into this lurid insanity. One tool, I had taken a particular interest in. My hammer, I had called her Helena in my insanity, and as time wore on – she became my second wife, incorruptible in her inanimate form.  From my rantings, you may know her as a male cricket known as “Conscience.” Pinocchio, my last and greatest creation – came to be when I was particularly under the influence of that realization of true regret, as I  heard my decedent son’s voice emanating from the block of wood I was beginning  to form into his image to find some strange sense of consolation in my endless madness. It cried out to me, calling out to me…”Papa…Papa, love me...” it murmured with the slightest hint of insidious intent. As I reviled away from my tools and looked accusingly at my Helena, the voice returned my confusion with scorn saying; “Why won’t you love me, Papa? Polio hurts even more when substituted for work, Papa,” with a stinging smirk that could be felt even without the assistance a face gives. Still, ignoring these voices as the hollowed echoes of the dead; I felt compelled to continue the work – and how ignorant that work would be. Furiously I carved and chipped, further proceeding with this grisly task, as if somehow overcoming that condescending phantasm – digging ever deeper into the wood, soon forming the beginnings of a face and as I finished my work – I felt, somehow successful as this incriminating voice urged me ever further. Work indeed, I thought to myself, placing my hand upon my hips and observing the fruits of my labor. I walked slowly towards my lonely bed and therein lay silently, failing to fully fall asleep as visions of my Pinocchio raising clouded my mind… my Isabella helping him all the way. If only I’d made a pezzo di legno instead, I thought as I finally succumbed to slumber – disturbed deeply by the vicious voices constantly clawing at my mind with their despicable digits of discourse. 
When I awoke, I cradled my dear Pinocchio – unaware of what’d happened when suddenly, that characteristic voice answered my joy with “Papa? Papa the blue fairy’s magic was real!” I asked this piece of wood what precisely he meant and the description he gave, sent chills down my spine. Truly, I’d gone mad because as I lifted my head; realizing the absurdity of the situation – my taking to conversing with what are assumed to be inanimate objects –I steadfastly realized that there was no life in my marionette at all. Rather, it was a crazed lunatic who’d found his way into my house. Obviously, it was one of Mastreo Bombino’s men – come to mock me once again whilst simultaneously asking for protection money. 

His short, chubby face and speckled brown hair did nothing to hide the bat behind his back. He smirked upon my creation saying, “C’rea una volta3, a crazy old man’s illegitimate son died of polio,” he began, as if speaking to a group of children – and not to an introverted old man, wincing in anticipation of pain – breathing in deeply and taking a swing with the mahogany bat with the inscription “Pleasure Island Amusements” embroidered upon it, he continued, “which is all fine and sad – but soon the old man forgot to pay his tribute to Signore Bombino. And we all know how that ends, don’t we children?” He smiled at that little anecdote, creating what I assume was a drug-induced manifestation of children. Slowly he began taking another swing with his bat, and I attempted to throw my hands up in resistance only to have Pinocchio stricken from my clasp. “Oh look,” the lunatic called Vinnie said, reaching down to pick up my lifeless child “a little toy by a creepy old wood maker. What do you think this is worth Gepetto – enough to pay your debt of 10,000 lire4?” Obviously I couldn’t answer as the air was stricken from my lungs as I attempted to speak. “Huh? What was that? I can’t here you over the sound of your dead son.  Maybe he shouldn’t have gone to that carnival, eh?” Vincent said, taking a final swing which instantly knocked me further into the ground of my workshop.  As he left the cabin, I cursed him. How he dare think himself so mighty; because he was, I thought to myself. He was mightier, morals aside. I was just an old man – a mad, lonely, desperate little old man. This traumatic experience, this descent into the madness of my own mind, led me to pen that little fairy tale.  
I had lost another child, to another infectious disease – not a viral affliction, but greed. Greed had taken my wife, and now it had taken my child again. Polio can be cured, but my selfish deeds of the past had taken poor Paris from my grasp – and now, as I write this last memoir to my horrid life on this island of regret and despair, I wish only that I could have told at least half as much truth as I did. Now you know why Pinocchio never really became a real boy. I was never a real boy; I was a shell of a human being – and eventually that deceit spread like polio, infecting me entire being, forcing me to pen that storied fairy tale. It pains me even now, as I stare off the side of this sheer cliff face staring into the abyss of failure and acceptance – that I had lied to you from the start. I suppose that old adage holds true today, “Reality is stranger than fiction.”

Is it not knowing what is there? Is it the shadows that seem to take shape or the uncertainty of whether or not you are safe? It is a combination. The feeling of not knowing what is there is what makes you feel unsafe. The feeling of not knowing is what makes those shadows take shape or is it even a shadow? That noise you heard, was it really just the wind, the house settling? Or was it something creeping closer. You can tell yourself we don't know you are there, that hiding under your covers will protect you. Yes look around. Scan the room but I can assure you that you will still be torn on whether I am really there or not. Why does that sound seem closer? That's because it is. We are moving closer. We are ready to confirm every nightmare, every spooky story or movie you ever heard of. Because in a way they are all based on us. Every monster or murderer was scene at some point by someone or how else would they think to give us shape? Because at some point that person saw us or heard us. At some point they saw the shadow moving and changing. At some point they saw the glint of Jason Voorhees machete in their closet. At some point they heard Freddy Krueger's blades clicking and sliding against the glass of their window.
I can see you trembling now wondering whether that shape is just a stack of clothes or something more sinister. Maybe you can't even see us but I know you feel us. Subconsciously you know we are here. You can try and reason that we aren't real but deep down you know we are. Is that the wind or something breathing? You'll never know and that is the beauty of it. For as long as there is darkness there is doubt.

I absolutely hate anything having to do with horror - and I didn't ""base"" this story off of anything.

These are events which happened in my life, and I'm telling you them in hopes to persuade you not to be taught the lessons I had to learn. 


My name is Justin, at the time of the start of these events I was a dishwasher at a local buffet. I didn't make a lot of money, nor did I have a great car. I was twenty years of age and in a community college studying business, oddly enough. 
I could go on and on, but I won't. You don't care about all of that.

Here's the deal: I'm into mysticism. Heavily. At that point and time I didn't really understand magick (yes, it's spelled with a ""k"") but I wanted to use it, like a kid with a new dirt bike. I practiced spell after spell, tarot reading after tarot reading without even referencing a single book. I created talismans and the such in hopes that I could one day get all the material wealth I could ever want.

That was my first weakness: attachment to the physical world; I loved money, recognition, and attention. 
I guess you could say I loved it because I rarely got any at all, and I felt that magick might be a method of attracting more people to me, getting them to like me. 
I mean, it seemed like a good idea at the time. You see those psychics on television all the time get praised for their work, why should I be any different? I can do pretty much all they do, and for *free*.


Yeah, *free*. It wouldn't cost the recipient any money out of their pocket, but I felt that they were obligated to give me something in return -- a ""thank you"" or an invitation to hang out with them. As you could probably tell I was incredibly lonely. I didn't have many friends back then, nor do I today; but today is not the past.

You see, ever since I was young people have taken advantage of my generosity. I would give them something and then they would completely forget it the next day. Even worse, they wouldn't even talk to me anymore. 
The problems escalated as life went on, every girlfriend I ever had cheated on me, my mother was insane and would blame me for everything that happened in the house, and my teachers would grade my papers differently than all the other students, apparently as a joke from what I heard after I graduated. Needless to say, my years coming up were not easy compared to everyone else.

People had friends, significant others, and parents who would treat them like children. I had me... that's it. At that time I didn't really believe in any higher deity even though I went to church, only because my parents made me. So it was extremely hard to cope with the fact of how alone I felt. 

The frustration built and built. 
Year after year everything proceeded to get worse and worse. Still no one paid attention to me nor asked how I was doing. I was continuously bullied and made fun of, never invited to a single party, and forced to eat lunch with the same people who believed that the school was run by alien lizards.

It was then, a year after my graduation I met a woman by the name of Monica. She ran a gift shop near my house, which wasn't all that significant... until I realized who and what she was.
She showed me this thing called ""magick"". Something I never really believed in.
Not only that, but she reaffirmed my faith in a divine being that went by many different names. I was happy for the first time in a long time.
She told me I was powerful. Something I never really believed before, and still struggle with understanding to this day.


Though, the spells wore off after a while and went back to my old self again. Just the same old me, slowly dying in the inside from loneliness. The same kind of loneliness that makes you feel excluded in a room full of people. All because not one of them is talking to you.

Magick is all about intent, let me tell you that. Any spell you cast, no matter how you cast it, should be cast with the right intent. Your Will drives all, and that's what I didn't understand. It's essentially the same thing as saying, ""I know I can, I know I can, I know I can"" over and over again until you've convinced yourself that you can do it.





Dread. That's the best way to describe what I felt every night when I went to bed. Hate. Anger. Betrayal.

All of those things, from wake to sleep, every day of the week. There was never a break from it.
Little did I know, I had been ""charging"" this emotion. It was getting stronger and stronger, taking over me like a virus to the point that I could feel it running through my body. 

Figures began manifesting themselves in front of my eyes. A man with dark eyes who screamed at me. 
Screaming. That's what I felt from wake to sleep. Every day of the week. 

Screaming.

I became so angry, so enraged that I couldn't take it any more. I hated everything and I was about to burst.
When I exploded, everyone who ever hurt me was made aware of it. Constantly.

And in that heat of anger, I felt myself become more and more corrupted by this feeling of pain. 
Pain. From wake to sleep. It was all that encompassed my mind from wake to sleep. Each day of the week. 

I didn't know how to take it, I couldn't take it, I wouldn't take it. I hated everything. I was so angry, so upset, so frustrated.

Everything spell I cast didn't work and only made everything worse. Every person I met always forgot about me. I felt so hurt, so ravaged by everything that I decided to let it ""flow"".
My rage become a ""life force"". It was the reason I was alive, why I should exist.

I remember attempting suicide and my mother crying after she found me. She cared. But it wasn't enough.

No one else cared about me, no one would even bother to think about what all I did for them. 

I asked to be invited to things, I wanted to be part of something, but everyone refused by making up some excuse.


I begged. They didn't respond. I was shooed away.
My rage reached its limit, I was insanely upset. 

I later went insane, with nearly a week of my life gone from my memory. All I remember is the fact that I attempted to shove the pain I was feeling down everyone else's throat. I wanted them to know they did this, I wanted them to know I was alone.

Alone. 
Christ Jesus, I understand that word better than anyone else.

I remember one day when I was walking up the stairs I turned around and saw a black mass staring back at me. It then phased through the wall and left me alone.
For the first time in the while I felt that something actually cared about me, even if it wanted to kill me in the end. That brief moment of attention was the world to me. 

Everything continued to get worse and I progressively got more hostile. 
Eventually I was excluded from even family events. And that was it, I knew I didn't want to deal with this pain anymore. I didn't want to carry it around even if nothing changed in my life.

Everything was horrible, and nothing could make it not horrible except getting rid of the source.
I banished it, and for the first time I felt free. 

Free. 
I love that word, since we're never really free.

Nowadays, I help people as a counselor with most of my clients being teenagers to mid-20s like myself. 

Chop wood, carry water.

This tape exists, although I don’t know where you can find one, I came across it on accident. The film I found wasn't the real Fright Night, but a low budget bootleg.

I was home alone, desperate for something to entertain me, so I searched for a movie, I wanted the feeling of nostalgic so I searched for a VCR tape, and I saw one that caught my attention. No cardboard case, which is normally what they come in, just small plastic bag, the tape had some duct tape covering the face of it, labeled “Fright Nights.”

After a long wait for the intro of the film to appear, I was greeted with a black screen with white text, reading “If the viewer(s) are to experience hallucination while watching this film, eject the film from VCR and do not at any time continue viewing it. Viewer discretion is advised.” 

Hallucinations? What the fuck? I chuckled after realizing how silly that sounds, although I did take slight concern about it. 

I was about thirty minutes in, most of the film was of people going through a dark house, with cheesy props for the monsters, you could see how obvious and fake the costumes/props were, plastic monsters relying on mechanics to engineer their movement. 

Fifty minutes in now, the film died into a wave of static. I remained still, waiting for something to happen. This is when shit hit the fan.

My ears began ringing, and I felt dizzy for a moment. A loud crash was heard in the room behind me, I was to much of a bitch to look over my shoulder, I was scared. I swear to god, I heard something scurrying across my kitchen floor, along with a light panting sound.

My eyes refocused on the TV which now was showing the film, it showed something tall, jet black shiny skin, pointed ears, a long, skinny nose, and very little yet vicious looking teeth. It was chasing the actors through the house, although unlike the other monsters and props, this one looked more modern, well, more realistic than the other costumes/props.

The ringing in my ears returned. I felt dizzy, fading away, my vision stretched as it became disoriented. That scurrying sound returned, along with a tapping on the window in the living room. I heard someone walking up and down the stairs, in a never ending loop. I looked to the window after a long period of hesitation, and I saw hand, jet black skin, and unnaturally long finger nails tapping it. When I say hand, I mean a hand, no arm, just the hand and fingers. 

The rest of the night, I spent curled up in a ball in my room. The sounds never came to an end. I saw shadows coming from outside my window cast across my room, it looked like people dancing.  Children. I heard them chanting the nursery rhyme London Bridge. 

After a few minutes of sobbing, through the darkness,  I saw the silhouette of a tall man, hunched back, walk past my door way. I heard a faint crying sound coming from my closet. This was all to much, this is a fucking nightmare! What is happening to me! I’m writing this now as I hear people tapping on my window, they whisper to themselves, I’m getting rid of this film after this is all over, rather I sell it on ebay, or throw it in someones garbage can, I am never, watching a VCR tape again. 
There it is again, that faint crying sound, only it’s not coming from my closet, it’s coming from the silhouette of a women walking out of it. Just remember, I’m only hallucinating, it’s not real. Nothing will hurt me. 

She's right in front of me now, she's staring at me. Her crying was now replaced with sobbing as she twitched. She keeps getting closer... There's that other creature, that jet black one, leaning into my doorway, his yellow eyes piercing right through the darkness.

Go to the nearest derelict mental institution that you can, preferably one that follows the plans of the Architect. The Architect’s seal will be on them, a set of letters reading TSK. When you find these letters on the front door to the building, carved in a makeshift manner, enter. There will be a desk, covered in dust and cobwebs. And behind it will be a worker, the vacant gaze in their eyes giving them the feel of an automatic servant to your will. Ask them to take you to the two that call themselves the Holder of Duality.

A look of childlike fear shall appear on the worker’s face. But they shall lead you to a door that was not there prior. Upon your entering this cell of the room, they shall allow you to walk your own way down the hall, their face pale with fright. From this point on, your life will be in the hands of chance - do not believe that personal skill will take you down this road. It is a gamble, with a loss and a victory for each who dares take it.

The hallway will be long, and every few cells you’ll find yourself being forced to turn one way, then the other to continue down the hall the way you had began. There shall be no sound, except for your own footsteps echoing throughout the hallway. 

Nearing the end of the hall you will find yourself hearing a conversation between a man and a woman, the two of them speaking in a bizarre tongue that you have never heard before. Their words will cease as you see the open cell door after a final turn, the sound of silence once again in the room.

Speak loudly and clearly, with conviction, and say that you are here to see an old friend. If the sound of footsteps begin, run. Do not hesitate, do not look behind you. Flee from this place until you are in an open mental institution, and only then will you be safe.

If there are not footsteps, walk towards the open door and enter. A beautiful woman and an aged, decrepit - yet oddly magnetic - man will be in the room, the two watching you. They will offer you a seat, accept it. 

Ask the man, “What will happen if the Two-Headed Lord brings Them together?” and he shall respond with excruciating detail of the horrors that will occur if the Two-Headed Lord brings them together. Many go mad from the tale, but those who do not will be a step closer to understanding the Two-Headed Lord.

He shall give you a wrapped object, which you must never open. If you open it your death shall be at his hands, in this very room.

Ask the woman, “Why does the Two-Headed Lord desire them?” and she shall explain to you his origins, of the death from which he sprung. She shall tell of the battle he waged with the Reclaimer, of the devastation he brought to the land before he was brought to his knees by a mere mortal. And she shall speak of his desire to end it all. Many will also go mad from this tale, but those who do not will be a step closer to mastering the Two-Headed Lord’s power.

She will give you a handheld mirror, able to show you the way to the Two-Headed Lord.

His head throbbed and his pulse beat in his temples. All he could see was darkness; red when his eyes were closed, black when they were opened.  The musty smell of a basement flooded his nostrils. The concrete floor below him and to his back was cold and hard under his hands and legs. He slowly drew his hand up to his face and touched his nose. A sharp bolt of pain shot through his face and shook him all the way to his stomach. His hand was sticky with an unseen substance from his nose. 

The darkness suffocated him and only amplified his fear of his unknown surroundings. Every time he tried to focus his eyes they became blurry and the throbbing in his head grew stronger. The wall behind him was a comfort only for its reassurance that there was something there. The vague thought of what else was in the room planted a seed of both hope and fear.

He had no recollection of coming to this room or what he had been doing before. His own name was covered by a haze in his head. He tried to think, to call forth the memories that eluded him, but nothing would come. He was helpless to restore his memory at the moment; he needed to find out where he was before anything could jar his memory loose. With a great effort he tried to pull himself to his feet. The pain that racked his whole body kept him tethered to the ground and no amount of effort could overcome it. He pushed himself up as hard as he could and the world turned to grey stars then nothing.

He awoke a second time. His head felt slightly better, but the rest of his body was still a wreck. Nothing had changed in the darkness. The air was still moist and musty, but this drew nothing from his useless memory. I don’t need to know how I got here, I just need to get out. Remembering that trying to stand up threw him back into unconsciousness, he attempted a different approach. He pushed with one hand and rolled to the side. The grey came back for him, but he held it off and managed to stay conscious. Slowly, he pushed himself up on his hands and knees, fighting the grey the whole time. 

Once upright he settled on his legs and sat for a moment gaining his strength. The air around him was still and cold. For the first time he noticed how quiet it was; nothing but the sound of his own labored breathing could be heard. He strained himself trying to hear something, anything, but nothing was heard. Fear had been planted in his mind the moment he awoke, but now it was beginning to grow stronger, growing from a quiet drip to a more noticeable dribble. 

Reaching his hand to his left he felt the wall. Slowly, he moved to all fours and began to crawl forward. He moved a few inches, stopped, felt the wall, moved a few inches… He crawled onward, exploring the dark hell around him. The cold floor made his already sore legs hurt more, but he did not notice; the adrenaline of pain and fear had dulled him to such feelings. All that mattered now was touching the wall, moving, touching the wall, moving, hitting a wall in front of him.
 
He stopped. Felling with his hand he traced the line between the wall he had been following and the new wall directly in front of him. He sat again, breathing hard from the effort of crawling. At this point the corner was meaningless, but if he kept following the walls there was sure to be a door, and with a door… Freedom. 

Freedom gave him the boost he needed and he crawled forward along the new wall. Move, touch the wall, move, touch the wall, move, moan. He froze instantly. No sound had come from him, he was sure of it. I did not do that. The hair slowly rose on the nape of his neck and his whole body went cold. Where ever he was, he was not alone.

He stayed in the same frozen position he knew not how long. One minute. Five minutes. An hour. Days. It all felt the same: timeless and unrelenting in terror. Slowly, he began to convince himself that the noise had come from him. The thought was futile at first, but slowly began to soothe his already strained mind. The torrent of fear he had felt settled down to a fast current, a steady stream, then back to a slow, quiet drip.

With his confidence back he set out along the wall again. Move, touch, move, touch, move, touch, wall. He hit a third wall. This new wall felt the same as the first two, cold, hard, slightly damp in the moist air. He sighed, scaring himself at the sudden noise. The perpetual silence was beginning to wear on his mind. Perhaps it’s better than hearing something…

His confidence was returning having discovered the third wall. From his exploration he figured the room to be twenty feet wide. Not that it mattered. All that worried him was getting out. The darkness, silence, and pain were beginning to wear on his mind. Before too much longer he wouldn’t be able to handle it anymore. Fear was starting to overcome him, but for now, he was still in control.
Wall number three. He began shuffling along the side as he had before. Please let there be a door here. His head connected with something in front of him. It wasn’t another wall, but it was something new. Hope gleamed in his mind as he ran his hand over the obstruction. He felt a vertical metal rod, cold as the stone. Exploring further, he felt a soft, sticky material between the metal and the wall. The feeling was of cloth splattered with a thick liquid. 

He kept exploring with his hand, knowing what he had found was not a door, but something else entirely. He moved in front of the object and reached out. He felt more cloth and then something firm. Something warm. The moan. That thought was all it took. He jerked on his back releasing a stifled scream. His mind was filled with countless images of what could be mounted on the wall, why it could be on the wall, how well it was secured to the wall-
He froze. Silence. A soft rustle, then the release of a breath. He had not been breathing for the last minute. Another shuffle. He dared not move. The unknown horror on the wall shifted again then lay silent. He could not breathe. The cold, damp, musty air felt deprived of all oxygen, like he was trapped in a vacuum. The gray began to creep towards the center of his vision. Forcing himself to take a breath he did so as quietly as possible. 

His mind was blank. The absolute horror had numbed every sense in his body. Slowly, very, very slowly, he began to react. I’m not alone. The thought that another person was in here was comforting, but the thought that it wasn’t a person jumped into his head just as fast. Don’t be ridiculous. No matter how terrified you may be you must think rationally. The thought lingered. I could move away then call to them. They seem secured and I’d be safe then. 

Trying to think rationally harder than ever, he rolled to his stomach and began to crawl toward the wall opposite from his new friend. The trip seemed to take forever, but he knew his judgment was still clouded from the scare that he had and his reemerging pain. He kept crawling until he hit a puddle. The puddle was mostly dry, but a few tacky spots remained. A new smell entered his nostrils; copper. He reached up and touched his extremely sore nose again and found the same mess on his face. 

I’m not the first one that’s been in here. He stopped and slowly, quietly, turned around.  His breath froze in his mouth then drained in a labored moan. The yellow glare of eyes met his gaze from across the room. The silence had been broken by breathing. He was not breathing. There was the sound of something large, something powerful, something heavy moving from across the room. The eyes moved with it. The eyes grew larger, grew closer. He could not do anything; only stare into the eyes of his friend as the grey began to close on him for a final time.

Channel 636

(suggested song to be played in the background: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH-AU9ykCbY) 

I just want to start off by saying, If you want an answer by the end. There isn’t one. What happened that night was unexplainable. 
It was Friday morning, 2am. I was working my usual graveyard shift at the office, I work for security you see, and I decided to switch on the television since there wasn’t really much to do. I was alone in the office and it was impossible to see what was going on outside, it was pitch black. Alongside all the office lights but the room I was in being off, It was a slightly creepy atmosphere. A chill ran down my neck, the hairs on my arms stood on end, I can’t quite explain how it felt but it was certainly strange. I shook that aside and flicked through the channels, rubbish, rubbish, MTV, rubbish. There wasn’t much on so I left it on MTV while I took a walk around, I went up to the window and stared outside. I could make out faintly the forest outside, It’s quite strange where this office is situated, I often wondered about why on earth someone would choose to build an office on the border between the city and the forest. I noticed a tall dark figure in the far distance, he was simply standing there, and it seemed as if he was staring at me. 
“I must be seeing things” I muttered aloud
I walked back to the television and flicked through. It was all the typical late night crap, that was until I turned to Channel 636. No name no title, just  “636”. It was showing a cartoon, obviously aimed at children. There was a rabbit running around with a cat in what seemed to be a school, It was all normal. That was until the rabbit fell over. He lay on the floor, the scene just froze there. I noticed that his eyes seemed to be more realistic, they were glazed and human like. Then the rabbit sat up, and started crying, but it sounded real. Like someone recorded a child crying and just used that as audio, tears were rolling down his eyes in an extremely realistic way. Suddenly the scene changed, the rabbit was home and was sitting on his bed, just staring back at you, again with the realistic eyes; And it just stayed like that, just staring. Then I started hearing booing from what I’m assuming was outside of the rabbit’s home, It wasn’t the comical funny booing you usually hear in cartoon, it sounded angry, very angry. 

At this point I found myself quite creeped out, so I paused it and went to get a cup of water. As I walked to the kitchen I heard crying coming from outside, so I went to the window to see what it was, I scanned my eyes around the forest, trying to make out what I could from the pitch black. It didn’t seem like there was anyone there, how strange. I walked back to the television, I unpaused it and it continued almost immediately onto another scene, this time the rabbit was playing a saxophone in a room by himself. Suddenly I heard a crash behind me, I paused the television quickly and went to see what it was. I walked towards where I heard the crash come from, the window had a huge crack on it, someone had thrown something at it or tried to get in. I reached for my phone to call the police to check around the area, but my phone was switched off, it was completely dead. 
“Bloody thing, battery barely lasts half a day.” I muttered loudly, 
I went to use the office phone but that too wasn’t working, I was quite worried, someone had clearly been trying to break the window and I had no way to contact anyone. I shook it off as just paranoia from the lack of sleep and went back to the television, but I came back to something that completely shocked me. It was a picture of a child. Dead and naked, their body on a pavement with their head cut off completely. It was so bloody and gruesome. My first thought was that this must have been some sort of sick joke someone did, but where would they get a photo like that in the first place? It didn’t have any dates or stamps on it so it couldn’t be police evidence, you could see the shadow of the photographer in the picture. Moreover the photo was done at an angle, it was almost as if the photographer had positioned the body for the picture. Was the photographer the killer? It was sickening so I unpaused it and carried on watching, I wondered if there were anymore hidden pictures like this in the cartoon. 
The rabbit then stared at the viewer again, this time he spoke;
“He’s coming” the rabbit said, his voice sounded so real, far more higher definition, even by studio standards. It was almost as if he was there with me, but who was ‘he’ that the rabbit was talking about? Perhaps the cat or another animal? 
He continued to repeat himself for about 10 minutes, after the last “He’s coming” he pulled out a shotgun, and shot himself. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at, this can’t have been for children, the blood splattered all over the screen, It was so real and flowed and dripped like real blood. I reached out and touched the screen and to my horror, there was blood on my fingers. I fell to the floor and started shaking, this was ridiculous. 
I heard the crying again, this time It definitely sounded like it was coming from inside the building; Shaking, I slowly started walking towards the sound, it was at the end of the office, towards where the cracked window was. And lying there was a rabbit, it’s head dismembered and its organs pouring out of its stomach, the carpet it was on was a deep shade of crimson and the window was smashed completely. I picked up the rabbit in my hands and noticed that it had a mark on it, it seemed as if it was burnt on by some sort of branding iron. It was a circle with a triangle within it and within the space there were complex patterns and tiny pictures that I couldn’t make out. I put it down and looked around, where on earth could the scream have come from...
“Hello?” I called out, my voice shaking, “Is there anyone here? Are you hurt?”
There was an eerie silence, it wasn’t a usual silence. There was something different, I could feel that someone, or something was in the building with me. I turned to the broken window and realised that the dead rabbit was gone, the blood stain and the organs were still there, but there was no trace of the body.
“Hello?” I shouted again, this time out of the broken window
I took out my flashlight and cautiously walked outside;
“Anyone there?” I called as I looked around, there was no breeze and everything was very quiet, which was very peculiar considering that I was between the city and the woods. I walked towards the trees, and my mind went back to earlier when I saw the tall figure, he might be behind this all, but who was he, some sort of pranker. I hoped. 
Suddenly I felt a grip on my throat, there was no one there but I felt the air going from my lungs. My arms became weak and my legs just crumbled beneath me, I fell to the floor gasping for air. As I was blacking out I looked up and saw a tall man in a black suit, he was bald with no facial features save an ugly scar that ran where his mouth should be. It twisted into what seemed to be a smile, and I blacked out.

I woke up in the middle of the woods, I was covered in blood and I felt a pain in my side. I lifted my shirt and saw the brand that was on the rabbit on my side, It was agonizingly painful and was throbbing. I blindly made my way through the woods, each step causing me more pain until I reached a road, to my luck there was a police car passing by and they took me to the hospital. They couldn’t explain what was wrong with me, my leg had turned dark black but was still fully functional and had nothing wrong with it. They eventually let me out and I went home, as I opened my front door I was hit with a strong smell, I looked around and I couldn't find the source. Until I went to my room. There above my bed was a rabbit pinned to the wall with its organs on my pillow, the circle with the triangle sign smeared everywhere on my walls.

I quit my job and moved out of that town, since then I’ve been living in constant fear of the tall suited man. I don’t know what he wants, or what links he had with the cartoon, but I’m scared.

I get up and open the door and hit the switch right next to it in the hallway. Nothing. It's too dark. My heart jumps for a second. I'm all alone, and it's dark. I just woke up, I don't know what's going on. I remember there's two switches to the hallway light, one in the living room as well. If one of them is flicked halfway then the light doesn't turn on. I run towards the dark outline of the door and hit the light.

Nothing. The lights for the dining table and the hallway aren't working. My heart really starts beating now. I'm scared. I feel like a child. Usually the dark is fine, but not now. Not when I'm alone. I feel something. In the living room. What is it? I don't know. It's too dark, I'm scared like fuck. I run immediately towards the front door. Thinking that if I could just get some light everything would be okay. I open the door and run out into the parking lot next to my apartment. It's Oprah.

My heart has either stopped, or it's beating so fast I can't even feel it. I have never been so scared in my life. Her dark malicious aura pierces my heart like steel daggers. She's so fat and black. The darkness of her face, is it even a face? What is she? Her tan dress, she starts floating. I'm scared out of my mind. I want to go back. Run back to my room. I can't. I can't move. I have no control. I get a feeling this is a dream. 

I suppose the idea was vaguely in my head the whole time. But why does it feel so real? I can't move. She's sucking me in. I put all my willpower into getting away, but I just can't do it. I'm trying to wake up, but the dream wants to keep my asleep. The dream is sucking me in. Why does it hold so much power over me? Why, if it's my own dream that my brain has made, does it have such control?

I get flung back. I'm on the ceiling now. I'm looking down at my bed. I'm facing the ceiling while facing the floor. I'm dancing. Bouncing up and down. Oprah's still there. I know it. I'm trying to escape. I'm trying to leave this awful dream. I want to wake up, and be rid of this. Whatever it is. This awful nightmare that seems so real. This awful reality that has so much control. I'm bouncing. I'm trying to leave, but I just can't do it. It's like trying to piss after jerking off, or taking a walk after your feet have fallen asleep.

I feel it fading. Finally. I still can't feel my heart, and I'm sill filled with terror. But it's going now. I won't have to go through this again. Dreams like this are awful, but once I wake up, it'll go away. It'll be a vague imprint in my mind that slowly fades away, until it's gone completely. Yes...it's fading..I can feel it.

I’ve never been scared of anything in my entire life because of my childhood, but one horrifying night, changed everything. I was ten years old and I was living in a pretty old house in the lower part of Florida. It was always very hot, but I didn’t mind. Cockroaches were infamous for being present when it was hot. They were also infamous for scaring the hell out of me when I least expected to be scared.
	It was late at night and for the life of me, I could not sleep. I sat up and looked around and suddenly, bam!, a painful headache hit me. I needed to go get some medicine from the cabinet in the kitchen. No big deal, I’ll get up, go to the kitchen, get the medicine, and come back and have a nice night of sleep. This was not the case.
	I got up and started out of the room. Since the house was pretty old it had old, creaky wood floors. As I walked down the hall from my room, it went from quiet to loud very quickly. creak.... creak.... went the floors. I continued on. I was determined to get rid of this god-awful headache. When I got to the medicine cabinet and opened it, fear hit me. A single, lonely roach was sitting on the bottle of Advil. There was no way I was getting that medicine. I would rather die. As I staring at it, tap. I heard a small object hit the ground behind me. I was barely able to notice it, but the house was quiet. Honestly, I was scared to turn around. But, in my head, “Hey, i’m just being paranoid, stop being a little girl and see what hit the ground.”
	I turned around and looked down, holy shit, another cockroach. But, if I heard something hit the ground and all I see is this roach... then... oh no... the ceiling.. Very slowly, I looked up. Why is there a line of cockroaches crawling on the ceiling? No, a better question is, where are they going? It looks they’re crawling toward my parents room.. But why? I was reluctant to go see, but.. I have to.. I’m ten years old. I’m curious. I ran to my parents room and fell to my knees at the doorway. Both of my parents are standing on their bed. Side by side.. Roaches crawling through their mouths, ears, and eyes. After a few seconds, their bodies exploded.. In front of my face. Roaches bursting out of every intestine and opening.. It’s like they knew I was the Roach King..",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_182p1k,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/182p1k/katsaridaphobia_the_fear_of_cockroaches_first/,

1358721467.0,8,self.creepypasta,16yazj,Lights,Nightshady,12,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16yazj/lights/,"  Why are we afraid of the dark? Our fear of the dark is an instinctive fear, burrowed into our brain from ancient times. But why? Fear of height, fear of thunder, these fears we can understand. You could have easily fallen to your death and thunder means that lightning might be close by, but why are we afraid of the dark? It seems irrational, yet there was something in the dark that made such a big impact in our minds that we are still afraid, even now. Even adults who thought they have gotten over their fear will still be attacked by shadows of doubts, late at night, when the darkness is the strongest. What was in the dark that was so horrible, so terrifying that even after several millenniums, when so many other fears have been erased, that even now, we are still afraid of the dark? Some say that we are afraid because of the limited visibility, combined with the fact that predators that can rip you apart in seconds lurked in wait for you in the dark.  Others say it's because of the horror stories we have all read, stories which we have known since we were small. The answer is none of these.

  The real reason we are afraid is because of the creatures. They are tiny, the largest no bigger than the palm of your hand. Their body is like a spider’s, but the bottom of their feet is sharp as knives and there is no eyes, mouth, nose or anything on their body, just darkness. They have tendrils of darkness drifting around their body like black flames, making their exact shape rather... imprecise.  They hide in the darkest, least used and hardest to see places possible, coming out only during the night when everyone is sleeping. They can’t go into the light, but they’re not afraid of it either. The light is a physical barrier to them, and they are sort of ""pushed around"" by it, like it's a wall. These grotesque creatures are the remnants of negative spirits. When a person die while feeling a strong negative emotion, be it anger, sorrow, fear, envy or anything else like those, that particular part of their spirit becomes one of these creatures. From then on, the only thing it will be able to feel the emotion it’s made of and a deep, insatiable hunger. This hunger, it isn’t for food. It is for you, more specifically, your positive emotions. Joy, hope, gratitude, the likes.  Every night, after you crawl into your nice warm bed and drift off into the realm of dreams, that is when the creatures come out to play. They come out from whichever place they had been hiding in, a trickle at first but quickly becoming a river. Swarming over you ,millions—no, billions scuttling over your body, digging their claws into your skin and feeding on you. Their claws are coated with a small amount of the chemicals that cause sleep paralysis. By itself, there's only enough to lasts a few seconds, but there’s billions of them and the seconds adds up. Sometimes, there isn’t enough of them there and you wake up in the middle of the night, free to move around. Other times, you wake up while still paralyzed. Most people pass of the sight of the creatures feeding on them as nightmares, but you now know the truth.  Rarely are there too many of them feeding on you but when there is, the chemical can become deadly. If you don’t die, you will most likely get depression, since they took so much of your positive emotions. One of the most famous cases was in London in 1981, where so many of them gathered there that 11 healthy young teenagers died from the chemicals. Doctors called it SUD Syndrome and it was the inspiration for Nightmare on Elm Street.
 
 Now you know the truth, pass it on. Turn on the lights at night, do whatever you can to save yourself and pray they don’t come. There had been a steady increase in their numbers recently and death is becoming more common. They locked me up in here when I told them. Fools. They refused to listen, and said I was crazy. They took away the lights, said I have to confront my ""hallucinations"". I'm afraid, I can see them all the time now. If it wasn't for his visits, I would have truly gone insane a long time ago. I have to stop writing now, it's lights out in 2 minutes and I need to get into bed. GoodbyeTHE LIGHTS

 The above note was found beside the body of David H. Willson, a schizophrenic patient at the Clear Waters Institute for the mentally unstable. His body had been found on the morning of April 25, 2012 when his physiatrist was checking on him. It seemed that the mysterious man from this note may have had something to do with him becoming insane. We have confirmed that Wilson had mean getting daily visits from someone ever since he was sent in, but the only info we have on him is that Wilson met him 3 weeks ago, and had often invited him to his house.

Every time I see him, he just stands there, waiting for me to sleep. I haven’t slept in almost a week. If I close my eyes for too long, I can almost hear him laughing. The only things keeping me from sleep are random energy drinks, pills, and the fear. I couldn’t even begin to find the words to describe him, he’s not grotesque, but he can still strike fear into your very soul. 
 When I first saw him, I thought it was just another creep staring at me, not uncommon. Then I noticed he was always just in the reflections. I’d look in my car window, to see if I locked it, and he’d be there, until I turned to look at him. If I saw anything that made a reflection, I saw him. I busted all of the mirrors in my house, but then he appeared in the reflection in my glass of water, or on the television. He just stands there, motionless.
 Here I am, unable to sleep, too exhausted to move from my couch. I’m writing this to keep myself from falling asleep, but even now I can barely keep my eyes open. I’ve accepted the fact that my demise will meet me soon. If he doesn’t kill me, the exhaustion will. I don’t want to give him the satisfaction. 
 I-I can’t stay up anymore. Even as I type this, I can see his reflection in my laptop screen. He’s laughing, but his lips don’t even move. As I close my eyes, he waves to me. The first time I see him move, he’s waving goodbye, this will be the last time I see him… or anything, for that matter.

Either way, he's been popping up since last December.

I haven't had the chance to take pictures yet, but I have a few stories from around the state.


NEWTON -- Moved here about a year ago from CA. Nice little town with predominantly Italian community. My only sighting here was at a local playground at dusk.

I often took to taking a few beers to the local park (it was pretty much never used except by teenagers with cheap takout or illicit alcohol. Like me). I'd swing on the swings, drink some cheap swill, listen to my iPod or sing to myself, just a way to get out of the house and away from my computer. I'd done it a number of times before, but never again after the sighting. At first I thought I was just drunkenly paranoid, because I thought I heard someone crooning along to my rendition of Ingrid Michaelson's ""The Way I Am"". I stopped because I didn't want to get caught, but I didn't look around -- just packed up quickly and tried to stuff my bandana into the open can of PBR before shoving it into my backpack. I left at a good time, because I hurried off rather quickly and only paused to ""tie my shoe"" and look around at whoever else was in the playground.
Standing near the swing set I had just been sitting on, clutching the struts and holding itself upright, was The Rake. At the time I didn't know much about creepypasta, although I knew about the Slender Man, and I was justifiably freaked. Okay, so I was a little buzzed and only looking out of the corner of my eye, but I still can't shake the image of the almost canine face and eyes peering at me. Looking back, I guess he seemed a little wistful that we didn't finish our duet, but the last thing I wanted to hear was more of that odd buzzing hum that was, I suppose, The Rake trying to sing without opening it's hideous jaws.

I heard the crooning again that night as I was going to sleep, though.


WORCESTER -- My (future)-in-laws live in Worcester. It's a pretty urban area, almost too much for The Rake, or so I thought. I was visiting the Eco-Tarium because my fiancee needed to research the area for a book. This time it wasn't a direct contact, but a recording. The Eco-Tarium has a daily recording of the weather outside of their big window, and you can rewind and rewatch the weather, from second to second, going back for a good number of months. I didn't get to spend a lot of time going through it, but I caught a few glimpses. For the most part he just seemed to be passing by, crawling (especially disturbing at high speed replay) and at one point, pressing himself against the bottom floor glass door as though trying to come through. He seemed... oddly transfixed by the giant stuffed bear in the front hall. I kept my eyes peeled while we were there, but no luck, even though dusk was fast approaching. If anyone else visits there, I'd love to hear of any of their own encounters.


NORTH ADAMS -- Went to visit some friends here. A dying town that only lives to try to support MCLA (MA College of Liberal Arts). It's got that creepy, townies-vs-college-kids feel that is the sort of stuff that I think inspired Lovecraft's tales. A conversation with the fine folks I was visiting turned to creepypasta, and one of them mentioned a sighting of The Rake (I finally had a name for the creature). I asked about it, and they mentioned the Hoosac Tunnel (more info at http://www.hoosactunnel.net/ghost.php , for those looking for more creepypasta). Apparently there were two major sightings of him there.

The first one involved a student who took the usual dare to walk down the tunnel as far as he could. He only got a few yards in before freaking out (as you do) and turned to leave. At the mouth of the tunnel, he thought he saw a dog, but as he half-ran to get out of the dripping darkness and the animal came into view, he saw it slowly stand to reveal a naked, hairless, grey man with huge hands and no mouth. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, he was paralyzed with terror. He wasn't sure how much time passed before his friends started calling for him, and their voices reverberating down the shaft sent The Rake scurrying away on all fours again. As far as I know, the guy dropped out of MCLA and moved out of state.

The other student was also doing the Hoosac Tunnel dare and also ran into The Rake on her way out, but this time she ran back inside. Apparently it followed her rather complacently, as though it knew she was trapped, but she claimed that the eerie presence of the tunnel and the sounds of ghostly activity diminished as The Rake came into view. It was almost a guard dog for her, despite chasing the terrified student almost all the way through. By the time she made it through the tunnel and out to the other side, she turned around to see that The Rake had vanished -- and she had re-emerged on the same side she'd first entered.


ANDOVER -- Just moved here into a big house with a bunch of friends. I was kind of hoping I'd be rid of the stories and sightings, but no such luck. My fiance &amp; I were driving back from Sterling to Andover at about 2am, and we had just come off I-93. He was falling asleep at the wheel and I was super-drunk, but we managed to be sober/awake enough together to get back in one piece. As we were turning off the highway, our lights flashed through a section of woods, and I woke up fully with a jolt as I saw a flash of sickly pale skin. I was praying it was all in my whiskey-addled mind again, but I saw it a second time, more distinctly, as we made another turn away from a road that T-boned into the woods. This time he wasn't crawling, but launching himself from tree trunk to tree trunk, fingertips clutching the bark and powerful legs catapulting him along the same route we were taking home. My fiance didn't notice in his exhausted stupor, but I begged him to drive faster. He doesn't like ""scary stuff"", books or movies or creepypasta, and I didn't want to freak him out, but he got the message that I wanted to get home and got all ""protective man-ly"" on me as we pulled up at home.

Our house is pretty large, but it has a good amount of space around it and opens into a number of other gigantic, grassy backyards and snazzy big houses. I felt way too vulnerable, but I hustled us out of the car and up to the front door. Luckily I'd left the door unlocked, because the last thing I'd wanted to do was fumble with my keys like some horror film cliche. We got inside, and I made the mistake of looking out the door before I closed it.

The Rake had stopped at the dinky little white picket fence that bordered our property and the road. It had snaked it's obscenely long, stained claws through the slats and was clutching them like a man in prison, staring at us blankly with those awful, soul-searing eyes. I couldn't close the door, and it seemed content to just sit there and have a staring contest with me. A car drove up the road that's situated right in front of our house, blinding me with it's headlights. As it drove away, The Rake had disappeared.

I slammed the door and ran to bed.


I haven't had any indoors encounters with him yet, and I really, really, really don't want to. I think the sheer number of people who live with me MIGHT be deterring him. Or them.

but after news on creepypasta of the old video Useless.avi i just couldn't put myself through anything like that.
it may have been up for awhile but i'm just showing people who haven't noticed yet. there are currently three videos
The reddit user Ajax00 summarized the videos for me.


&gt;**Clean.AVI**

A 4 minute, grainy, black and white film which begins with the camera man walking down a small staircase into a hallway with many doors on either side of it. A moaning sound, not unlike a whimpering dog, is heard distantly, but becomes clearer as the camera stops and focuses on one particular door. After listening to the other side of the door for a moment, the camera man pushes it open. We see a blindfolded man in a dress shirt, loose tie, and shorts sitting on a covered toilet, facedown on the adjacent counter. The whimpering does not stop, but it doesn't seem to follow a consistent pattern either. The man stands up and begins to lick the countertop, the sink, the faucet, and sometimes the walls. At some points it seems there may be a second whimper, possibly coming from the camera man. This continues for the remainder of the video until the man stops cleaning and looks directly at the camera with his blindfold still intact. The uploader comments questions the viewer: ""Look closely at the man. Do you see yourself in him? Are you re-evaluating the things you look at online? Might they be abnormal?""

&gt;**Shack.AVI**

A 3-4 minute video that takes place inside a broken down, worn-out looking shack that, according to the commentary, is located somewhere along the English coast. The narrator is giving a historical commentary about WWII and military strategies (the entire video is black and white and has the sound quality of an older film), or at least I think he is. I watched the video twice (as suggested by the uploader comments) but it's difficult to pay attention to what the off-camera narrator is saying because of what's on-camera. After the camera briefly scans the room, it focuses on the center in which we see a young woman with long dark hair wearing a provocative dress. Her face is covered by a thin Jabowockeez type mask. She has a plate seated upon her lap containing what appears to be three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She repeatedly attempts and fails to eat these sandwiches throughout the video as her mask covers her mouth. The sandwiches are destroyed in the process and fall back to the plate in a mess. The camera scans away from the women and appears to look at a blank wall for a moment before scanning back. We see the woman appear back on screen with a muscular, nude man standing arms-crossed behind her (nothing more than chest is seen). He is outfitted with the same mask. I can't be certain if my mind is just playing tricks on me, but there also appears to be more of the sandwich remains when the camera returns. The video ends with the man looking down and the woman mirroring his action.

&gt;**Impression.AVI**

This one was the shortest but by the far most disturbing.

A 2 minute video that begins where Shack.AVI left off. We are in the shack again, but the narration is gone. In its place is a horrible, garbling and crackling sound, as though the audible layer of the video file was corrupted. The camera pans from the floor the center of the room where the muscular man is seen. The chair in front of him is present but the woman is no longer sitting in it. He unfolds his arms part-way through the still scene and angrily throws the (now folded) chair down. The camera focuses on the chair, the man who has returned to folding his arms (in the same fashion as before, but now with an apparently rebellious undertone), and then focuses on the floor. The camera pans back up and the chair is neatly returned to its place and position at the center of the room, but the man is gone. The horrible crackling sound in the background is cutting in and out, especially as scenes cut or something dramatic (like the chair hitting the floor) happens. The scene cuts to a young girl, no older than four, is seen crying, then again to a zoomed in shot of the mask, and then the man sitting on the staircase, most likely the same one from Clean.AVI. He looks forlorn. Head down and arms crossed, he clutches his face in what appears to be him fighting an internal struggle. He tries to wipe a tear but his mask is in the way. This continues almost in a sinusoidal way, but it's definitely not looped. Eventually he stands up, perhaps frustrated, and crosses his arms once again at the camera man. The camera pans down into the darkness of the hallway as the awful sound returns, and the exact same cuts from before are seen, this time in reverse order, and then shows the white mask peering from the darkness over an indistinguishable setting. At the same time, a sound clip of a child (most likely the crying girl) is forked into the messed up audio channel. Though it wasn't very clear, I tried my best at making out what she says.

""Mommy! Where are you mama?""

""Mommy!""

""Bye mama. Bye. Bye mama.""

And the next part she says is either something about the mask, or ""I'm last.""
The video ends with the one more loop of the footage of the crying girl and the closeup of the masked face.

1344555303.0,7,self.creepypasta,xyty7,My first creepypasta,mrstrawberrybear,20,13,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/xyty7/my_first_creepypasta/,"“During the summer, my friends and I usually chill at our local church parking lot, mostly because of the shaded playground. The adults don’t care, and the preacher actually encourages it, so it’s all good. Most days we are there until about 10ish at night, sometimes later, depending on the day. Well one night, late July, I was driving home from the lot. I live a lot further away than the others do from the church, out in the country. I turned onto my county road, and right when I turned my brights on, I saw it for the first time, just for a moment. It was crouched over on the side of the road, and it looked up at me, I honked my horn, and it ran off. My first thought was just that it was a deer or something, which isn’t entirely too uncommon out in my parts. I got home, told my father that I had just saw a deer, and went to bed.

Sometime the next week, we were at it again, doing our shenanigans at the lot. We ran late this day, about 11:30ish, so it was really dark when I headed home. When I turned onto my street, I turned on my brights, and saw a figure up the road, about halfway to my house, standing in the road. As I got closer, I realized it was the same thing I had saw earlier, and it was definitely not a deer. It was upright, though pretty small, about 4 and a half feet. It had these piercing green eyes, no pupil, just green, though no other facial features. I just drove by it, again honking my horn to try to scare it off the road, and it was just standing there, following me with its head as I drove by. I must admit, I was frightened, but I kept telling myself “It’s nothing, I’ve seen weirder.” When I got home, I made sure all the doors were locked, and I went to bed.

Then school started. I went to a local university, and stayed at the dorms there, so there was no need for me to drive home at night anymore. It had been months since I saw it, but its eyes remained burned into my memory. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed mad as I passed it. But I had to just keep going, ignoring it. I told my buddies at the lot about it, and they said I was just tired and seeing things. I tried to believe them, and after a while, I did. One Friday we were back at the lot. It was about 10, and I realized I had left my textbook at home from when I had gone to say hi to the family earlier. So I left and was supposed to come right back.

When I turned onto my street, I noticed something up ahead, right by my house. It was kind of crouched over though, so I didn’t even think anything of it, until it looked up. It was unmistakable, those green eyes looking right at me. Then, from its dark face came a white line. It was a smile. It’s like it had been waiting for me since last time. I was scared out of my pants, so I kept driving, past my house, knowing it met up with the highway and I could go back to town. When I didn’t turn into my house, the smile left, and it looked angry. Next thing I saw was those green eyes following me, even though I must have been going at least 50. When I got to the highway, it was close behind me, and gaining ground, so I decided not to stop at the sign, and almost ran into some trucks driving by. When I was on the other side, on my way back to town, I looked back, just to see those green eyes looking back at me.

I drove back to the lot, not wanting to freak out my bros, thinking I had lost it. I didn’t tell them about it, and I tried to act “normal”. We were there for another half hour or so, and I was still shocked, but I was getting better. Then, I guess I wasn’t looking, but I heard a scream. And then another. Then I looked back and Matt and James were on the ground, dead, blood everywhere. Then I saw it. It was standing over them, not 5 feet away from me, with that same smile, and those green eyes. Then I looked down, and I saw it had a blade from its hand, like a claw, dripping with blood. I then turned to run to the youth building, hoping it was unlocked by accident, and it was. I held the door closed until I felt no more struggling on it, then I blocked it with a futon. I had no phone, nothing to call for help with. I got on the computer, and typed this up. Please, call for help, I can hear it banging on the door. Please, quickly.”

REPORTER NEWS 11-19-11  COLLEGE STUDENT COMMITS SUICIDE AFTER DOUBLE HOMICIDE
Local college student slays two high school seniors with blade, then takes own life with same blade. Police say student had been showing signs of paranoia and schizophrenia in the past months, and has kept blade in car, according to those who know the student. Reason for murders not known.

""I heard about the murders/suicide when police contacted me asking me how my roommate had been acting lately. It blew my mind. He used to be so fun and gentle, but lately he has been acting oddly. Not sleeping well, always paranoid about the blinds being closed, never driving home at night, and even being skiddish just walking around campus in the dark. I thought it was getting better a few weeks ago, and he had been sleeping better and acting more normal, then this happened. It’s just so shocking. I have been to his house many times lately, to be with his parents and brother, right when class gets out, and I go home right after dark. I just wonder why that deer with the green eyes is always there…""",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1344557993.0,,,True,t3_xyty7,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/xyty7/my_first_creepypasta/,

Today a friend of mine told me a story.

His aunt had taken care of him since he was a small boy, and she told him last night about how his parents died. He did a very fair imitation of her (I knew them both pretty well):

""They were doing mission work in some nasty little south american country when a man burst into the mission hospital one night, terrified out of his mind. He told them that his sister had been killed by a Muerto blanco, and that he was certain that it was coming for him next. What is a Muerto blanco? Apparently it was some sort of bogey-man, something like that dumb chupacabra or whatever. They called it the White Death or the White Girl, because it was the soul of someone who hated life so much that they came back in their shrouds to kill those who told of them.

The man had been told about the vengeful spirit by his sister hours before her death. It was a girl with dead, black eyes that wept bile. The thing moved without ever actually moving its legs, and it stalked its victims back to their homes. Now, if you weren't already aware that this thing was following you, once it got back to your house, it would start knocking on your door...

Once for you bones, which she'll use to patch her own decaying flesh.

Twice for your muscle, which she'll gnash her teeth on between victimes.

Thrice for your bones, which she'll make knives to pick her teeth and kill her victimes.

Four times for your heart, which she'll wear around her neck.

Five times for your teeth, which she'll polish and keep in a box.

Six times for your eyes, which she'll see the faces of your loved ones through.

Seven times for your soul, which she'll eat whole - you can never pass while you're in her stomach.

She has to repeat this on any mirror or door between you and her.

You can try to outrun her, but she's faster than the fastest man. And if you leave your home while she's knocking on your door, she won't be so courteous when she catches up to you.

Now the man was certain that this thing had killed his sister, that he had tried to tell the police, but they would not listen. Next he had tried to tell his priest, but the priest turned him away when he saw that the thing was following him now - oh, that's right, I forgot about that - it can only get you if you tell someone else about it, or you saw it kill someone else. The man, after finishing his tale, stole a car from the mission, and was never seen again.""

Apparently his mother and father had immediately called his aunt about this when it happened. They were found in the morning, skinned and dismembered. Their bodies were covered in tiny, child-like handprints.""

His aunt was really drunk the night before, and had told him about that. He told me this story early in the morning today at school, before the cops arrived. His aunt had been murdered that night. I called him later that night, and he told me that he was being chased by someone, and now they were knocking on his door. I told him to stop shitting me.

He held the phone away from his face for a minute, and I could hear slow, deliberate knocking. A moment later, I heard the door rip from its hinges and the dying screams of my friend.

Then a little girl's voice spoke over the line: ""WITNESS."" I hung up.

Three minutes ago someone started knocking on my door. She has to knock 28 times on my front door, 28 times on the mirror in the hall, and another 28 times on the door to my bedroom. She's doing it slowly... I think she wants to scare me some more, let me know that my death is just moments away. I will not run - I couldn't get to my car in time anyway. She started knocking on my bedroom door a minute ago, she should be done any moment.

Nice knowing you guys, it's been fuy5

Every so often I would cough nonstop, and it would take a while to cease. So while rummaging around a pile of newspapers I came across a flyer for a medical clinic. I quickly called the number on the page and booked an appointment. It was Saturday and the appointment was scheduled for Monday. I patiently waited for Monday to arrive, taking my daily doses of medicine. When Monday came I quickly got up from my bed, got ready, ate some breakfast, and dashed out the front door for my appointment. Then I stopped and realized that I had no idea where this clinic was. So I quickly ran up the frontsteps and powered on my computer and searched the address on google maps. I found out that it is nearby, about fifteen minutes away from my home. So I shut down the computer and darted out the front door.
I never forget my ipod, since it keeps me company. I later arrived at the clinic, then I signed in and waited in the waiting room among ten other people. It had been a few minutes since I sat down and then a tall pale man walked out of a door and called, ""John Rojas,"" the man got up and followed the tall pale man. Leaving nine of us waiting. Then, about ten minutes later the same man walked out and called out another name, ""Mary Wilson,"" the startled woman quickly got up and followed the man. Then I whipped out my ipod and played some music to make things somewhat more cheerful. Then after all the other people had been called, I put my ipod away so I could hear my name being called. Then I realized that it had been a long time since the first man, John Rojas, had been called, yet I have not seen him leave. There was only one door, leading in and out of the building, apart from the emergency exits. I figured he needed some sort of special treatment.

I sat down waiting for about an hour until finally my name had been called. I got up and followed the tall pale man into a room. Once inside he ran a few tests and then left the room. He didn't say anything, so I decided to wait. Then I had a strong urge to use the bathroom. So I quickly snuck out of the room and found the bathroom. Once I had finished going about my business I quickly rushed towards the room I was in earlier. On my way to the room I found several doors open. Curiosity got the best of me and I peeked inside, there, I saw the first man, John, sitting down with a blank expression on his face. His eyes quickly darted towards me and I left. I was startled, then I told myself I have no need going about peeking into other peoples' rooms.

I made my way to my room and waited for the doctor to see me. I saw no signs of anyone having walked inside. I waited and waited, until I heard a faint noise coming from the ventilation shaft. I told myself that i'm simply hearing things. Then after a while the noise grew louder. I began to grow unnerved. When suddenly I heard a knock at my door. It was a woman. Tall, pale skin, with long messy hair, she was wearing no clothes however she had no, how do I say this, genitals, and large black eyes that followed you wherever you go. As she silently walked in, the room grew extremely cold. I jumped back and stared up and the woman. She stared at me and I began to grow frightened. Then she opened her mouth and with a sorrowful whispering voice she said, ""Leave here...leave this place at once...it is an evil place...leave while you still have the chance...leave and never look back,"" then after a short period of time she bellowed, ""LEAVE!""

I quickly got up and shoved her aside and ran away, not looking back as the tall pale woman instructed me to do. I ran back home as fast as I could. It took several hours until I was finally calm. I took some medicine instead of visiting another clinic, and I never bothered to look for the clinic which I had gone to ever again. For I would always have nightmares of the tall pale woman speaking to me.

Re: entries/information requested re: compiling psychological profile

Written below are the journal entries of Christopher Young, brother of Daryl Young, found saved as individual files on his personal computer, with file names Prologue.doc, Ch1.doc, Ch2.doc, etc. Apart from being compiled into one document, they have not been altered in any way.

Prologue

Two weeks later, there was a sound. There was a humming. It came from that place on the carpet, the spot near the corner. His spot.


Ch 1

I’m getting concerned. I guess I was a bit distracted before, but my mind is clear now. They’re gone, and I am frankly growing more concerned by the minute.
A chalk-white amorphous thing. A hideous, absolutely hideous thing. I saw it. I saw it on the rug, and it scared me. It looked at me, grinning with half-formed white eyes filmed over. It writhed towards me. A heat, some sort of sickening heat radiated from it, and it saw my disgust and thrived upon it.
I had hoped it would live in one of the closets, but it was content to ooze about my home, leaving trails as it went. I am quite sure that if I had not put the towel under the bathroom door it would have tried to come in and join me while I bathed myself.


Ch 2

Today it has appendages. I am not sure if they existed before, but now they most certainly do. It has two, with one on either side, and it crawls haphazardly along like some sort of horrid lopsided insect. It tried to follow me out through the door, but I kicked it and it did not try any longer.
It thumps around as I try to sleep, dragging its body everywhere and leaving residue all over the house.
I took my cat to Daryl’s. The thing didn’t follow me. I’m glad. It may get me, but it will not get my cat.


Ch 3

It now has four appendages and is beginning to form a skull-like dome under its pulsing skin. It has a mouth, a crooked little mouth, and I am afraid it will begin to make sounds at me. Three of the appendages are longer than the fourth, so it mostly wobbles around in crooked little circles. It is getting bigger, and it never stops changing. I was hoping it would stay and become some sort of indiscernible monster, but now I am sure that it is becoming a person, or at the very least something similar. I would like to kill it. I wonder if I could.

We played for a while before it got dark.  Once it got dark we got the good idea to play a one versus three game. Since my friend had a small wooded area near his house, the one person would hide inside it while the other three had to infiltrate and shoot him.  The fastest and sneakiest of the four had to go in the woods first.  We picked who we thought was right and be first In the woods.  It was slowly getting darker but we could still barley see.  We counted for about a minute and wondered over to the woods.  The two friends that were with me walked to the left of me around a barn but they didn't get far before I saw something. They were going to try to ambush Eric (we will call him).  Right as they started walking around the barn to come up the back side of the small patch of woods I saw a shillouette run diagonally from one side of the woods to the middle. I immediately ran towards it screaming ""I found Eric! I found Eric!"" But as I did this..... Eric emerged from a bush behind me and said ""how did you see me?"".  When this happened my stomach dropped and I turned around and ran as fast as I could back to my friends house. I saw my other two friends had not even made it to the back of the woods so it couldn't have been them,but   Of course none of them believed what I saw but I know I did. It was no shadow either it was too dark for that.  But it was just light enough for me to see whatever it was.  And if Eric would not have come out of the bush I would have pursued it into the woods while my friends were no where near me.  I have tried to contemplate and think about what it could be but nothing seems to add up.  It was one of the scariest moments of my life so far.

It was named after the United States Postmaster General, Marshall Jewell. Jewell was a very successful tanner. He tanned many animal and out of all of them the one that never left his mind was the large black wolf he had brought in by an old man that only had one eye left. Jewell quickly noticed how blue his iris was and thought it was quite stunning. It seemed as if his gaze pierced his very soul. The man just wanted the fur fixed and tanned. The wolf itself was very large and had many scars on its body. Fixing these scars would be a challenge for Jewells. But he was up for the challenge. While he was skinning, the wolf would wheeze every once in the while. Thinking that there was air trapped in the wolf's lungs. He took out a large needle and pierced both lungs to let the air out. Instead of air coming out, a clear fluid came gushing out and spilled all over the floor. Having come across this phenomenon before he know exactly what was going on. The wolf had pneumonia. He waited for the fluid to drain completely before continuing to skin the wolf. After he was done he was pleased with his work and set the skin out to dry. Suddenly he hear a noise coming from the skinning room. He went to investigate and what he saw horrified him. The wolf that he just skinned and punctured its lungs was standing the table staring at him with large yellow eyes. Jewell quickly grabbed a knife hanging on the wall and lunged at the wolf. The wolf dodged and then lunged at Jewell. The wolf clamped down on Jewell's arm. Luckily for him he was wearing a think leather coat that couldn't be pierced by the wolf's teeth. Jewell took this opportunity to slash at the wolf. The blade of the knife ran across the wolf's large yellow eyes and left him blind. The wolf let go and started to shake its head violently. Jewell then stabbed the wolf right in the neck and pulled with all his might to leave a huge gash in the wolf's neck. The wolf laid there dead with all its blood pooling on the floor. Jewell was stunned, people started to pile into the room to see what happened. They were all horrified at what they saw. The wolf laid on the floor with a pool of blood around it with no fur and no eyes. Jewell stared at where the wolf's eyes used to be. Where were they? He didn't cut them out. He just cut across them. But they were gone, and it looked like they were gone for a long time. Wasting no time Jewell and a few others quickly buried the body of the wolf in the woods next to a large willow tree. Jewell tried his hardest to forget his ordeal and continue with his work. He finished the tanning of the hide and waited for it to be picked up by the old man. The old man finally showed up to pick it up the fur. When Jewell handed the old man the fur, he froze. The old man had two eyes now, but that wasn't what shot fear through his heart.

I was floating in complete darkness. I was completely aware of the fact that I was dreaming, but I couldn't control myself. I found relaxing though. After a long time of just floating, I started to get the feeling like I was going downhill on a rollercoaster. And thus, the hypnic jerk started. The falling sensation. The feeling of my body jerking awake. And then, that was it. I forgot about it and went back to sleep without a second thought. Then, the next night, the exact same thing happened. And night after that, and the night after that. For three weeks. 

I had gotten frightened, so I called my doctor. He told me about the whole process, about how it's called the hypnic jerk. He wanted me to visit him so he could figure out why this was happening to me. And after a couple days, with the strange dreams and hypnic jerks continuing, I visited him. He asked me questions. Questions that I hardly understood. He tested me. I realized after the visit, that what he did was useless. The dreams continued after that, and I didn't even know why. They got worse.

At first, all I would see was a small flicker of yellow light from far away. An ominous flicker. After three weeks of that, I started to see strange silhouettes, almost like the darkness was forming into a room. The light was still there, dancing in the darkness. After three weeks of that, the light went away. But the silhouettes did not leave. All that time, the dreams would end with a hypnic jerk. After such a long time of dealing with those strange dreams and hypnic jerks, I had decided to not sleep.

For about three or four days, I kept myself awake by drinking coffee, and by trying to keep myself busy. I felt as if I was going crazy. I probably was crazy at that point. I would draw what I saw in the dreams. The ominous flickering light. The silhouettes of the mysterious room. I wanted answers. Why was my brain making me wake up all the time? What caused those dreams to play over and over in my head? After around seventy-eight hours of staying awake, I finally fell asleep, sitting at my paper ridden desk. 

I was floating in complete darkness. Again. And then, the flickering yellow light appeared, followed by the silhouette of the room. Suddenly though, the room got brighter. It was my room. I looked around, and I was in my room. I was at my desk. I wasn't awake, but it certainly felt like I was. My room seemed different. Creepier. Distorted. I waited. I waited for the hypnic jerk. I wanted to wake up. I wanted to be able to sleep without fear.

And then these creatures appeared. Creatures that I would be afraid of as a child. Monsters hiding under the bed and in the closet. Only these monsters weren't something a sane child would imagine. They were covered in blood, their limbs hanging off of them. They moved closer to me, slowly. I couldn't move. Their crazed eyes locked on mine. They all groaned, they're voices gurgled from blood gathering in their rotting throats. I screamed.

Wake up.

I told myself to wake up. I put all of the will power left in my trembling body, and screamed at myself to wake up. 

Wake up.

The hypnic jerk did not occur. I wanted it to happen. I wanted this hellish dream to come to an end. I screamed as the horrific creatures closed in on me. I waited. Is it possible to die in nightmares?

I closed my eyes. And then falling. I was falling. I abruptly sat up. I opened my eyes, and greeted the darkness. I was in my dark room, now much less ominous and without those horrible creatures. After that night, I slept peacefully. There were no mysterious dreams, or hypnic jerks. Just sleep. I was frightened of everything though. I would sleep with lights on, and I still get shivers when I'm by myself in the darkness of the night. 

I don't know why those dreams occurred, or why I got those hypnic jerks. All I know is that I thank my brain for making me wake up. I think that the hypnic jerk occurred because it wanted to save me. It wanted to save me from whatever wanted to kill me in those dreams. I don't think that there is some sort of scientific reason behind all of this. I think that whatever causes the hypnic jerk knew about those dreams. 

It wanted me to wake up.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1jns3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jns3z/hypnic_jerk/,

Eyes fluttering and heavy, 
I could sleep.
I remember feeling tired and weak.
Then my weary body shook the rust away.

I could sleep 
no longer.
Then my weary mind shook the fog away,
My window was opened an inch.

“No, 
I am not worried at this time.” I said to myself. It is just that
my window was ajar an inch
and I strictly remember it being closed upon slumber’s edge.

“Now, should I be worried at this time?” I asked to myself. It is just that
the thought bothered me.
I remembered the window being closed upon slumber’s edge.
Thinking little more I closed it and tried sleeping.

Yet, the thought… It still bothered me.
I felt… I felt watched.
I tried to close that thought and think little more. 
With a casual glance across the room my heart leapt to my mouth.

I WAS! I WAS WATHCED!
Two white orbs floated in the air across from my bed.
The evil orbs glanced casually upon me seeing that I was awake.
Those orbs were eyes with irises as dark as the night sky just out of my room.

Two eyes floated in the air across from my bed.
They were accompanied by a silhouette holding a sinisterly curved knife.
The pupils, ever dark as death, glared at me seeing my obvious terror.
The shadow said something in the way only a madman could.

Those words were accompanied by the gestures of the knife caked with blood from crimes past.
With a slight tilt of the head “WHY DO YOU CRY?”, he shouted.
Then I screamed only in the way a person near death could scream.
Then, like a lion he pounced.

With the slight elevation of my foot, I caught the downswing of his knife hand. I shouted,
“Help, I’m being attacked!”
The man was distracted by the force of my defense and like a zebra I was able to bounce.
Down the stairs of my home I ran.

“HELP, I’M BEING ATTACKED!” I shouted louder
Lights of homes came on, out of those homes came friends, armed with kitchen utensils.
Out of the front window I saw my attacker dive.
And fled he did.

The light of the dank street illuminated the armed assailant
and I should have been able to see his features well,
as he fled.
Yet, I couldn’t. All could see were his ebony eyes.

But I was able to see this well.
Determination was in his eyes
as he fled.
He would attempt this again.

Determination was in my mind. The next day
I got a few things and I left, not telling a soul.
The man would make an attempt on my life again.
That is why I left.

Eyes fluttering and weary, 
Yet I sleep not.
For in my dreams when I look across my bed I see black eyes.
Then I awake from slumber and see that nothing is there…

I slammed on the brakes, and was in turn slammed into my seatbelt as my BMW M3 slowed. My bumper stopped only inches short of the crosswalk, and a group of half-stoned teenagers cursed at me as they jumped back. I waved impatiently and revved my engine. The straight-six roared, like a savage creature under the hood was waiting to be unleashed. As soon as the light switched, I popped the clutch and the car shot forward. Five seconds later, I was roaring down the country road at sixty miles an hour. Loud as the engine was, however, it was drowned out by the screaming in my head. Because, truth be told, I was running away. Away from my home and my wife and everything I knew, with nothing in the trunk but a tire iron and a suitcase with clothes for three days. The last words she had spoken to me as I threw jeans and shirts into my bag rang in my head. “Bastard!” She had called me as I ran out the door, a glass of whiskey nearly missing my skull. “Shithead!” “Asshole!” She said, over and over again in my head. Much as I tried to dredge up a memory, any memory of her that didn’t involve having profanity and heavy things thrown my way, I just couldn’t. So I ran. I ran to the driveway and my M3, throwing my suitcase in the back, banging my head on the opened trunk. I jumped in and turned on the engine and drove away and... Holy shit!

The deer seemed to take flight, nearly missing the hood of my car as it ran into the woods. I shook my head and tried to concentrate on the road. By now, I realized, I was far into the mountains, farther than I had ever been. I had missed the turnoff which led to the interstate, and was heading deeper into the Arkansas highlands. I was lost. As I drove, I passed the scene of an accident. There was a minivan turned over on its side, flames licking out of its engine bay. An ambulance was at the scene, but it was too late to save the driver, who was crushed against a tree, his (or her, I honestly couldn't tell) head missing. There was now fog creeping onto the sides of the road. I tried to turn my fog lamps on to watch for deer, but the bulbs popped and fizzled out. Startled, I kept my headlights on and opened my windows. As I did, the fog on the side of the road seemed to waft into my car, coating my mirrors and windshield in a thin translucent sheet. Increasingly unnerved, I tried to shut the windows, but they seemed to be stuck. Now half-terrified, I mashed the gas pedal. The engine screamed through the straight pipes and, spurred on by the sound, I upshifted and took off, my tires rumbling and squealing over the asphalt. The road widened to four lanes, and just in time, because as I came around a blind corner, there appeared an old Ford truck. As I came up behind it, I could hear its old engine straining to get up the hill. I flashed my signal, passed the old wreck and crested the hill. As I did, a set of headlamps flashed, making it nearly impossible to see through my foggy windshield. I flinched as the lights disappeared behind me, only to flash again as the car they were attached to crested the hill a few hundred yards behind me. I looked over my shoulder to identify the car, but its lights suddenly turned off. Then I saw the Ford roll over the hill. Or, more accurately, what was left of the Ford. 

It was skidding on raw rims, its tires shredded and sparks flying in a grotesque fireworks display. The man behind the wheel had been blown away and his blood obscured the windshield. The old truck flipped once as it slid off the road, landing in a thicket and catching fire as its gas tank ruptured. Over the cacophony of the crash, I heard the throaty growl of a big V8. Even louder, though, was a banshee-like scream. Both were growing closer, and I decided to make my getaway. I planted my foot on the gas, and accelerated. Even as my M3 put down all the power it could, I could hear the other car coming on fast. I hit the brakes as I rounded a turn, and the shrieking only grew louder. As I came out of the turn, I got my first look at my pursuer. The car was a jet-black 1967 Camaro SS, its silver racing stripes shining in the light of the full moon. The headlights abruptly came back on, and I could see skull-shaped cutouts over the lamps, throwing eerie white silhouettes on the road behind me. I cursed and dropped down a gear, my engine screaming as the car jumped forward. The Camaro shrieked as it accelerated. It had a monstrous hood scoop, and a silver glow emanated from inside. The muscle car swerved left, and came alongside me. I gunned my engine again, and pulled ahead. Then, and God help me for doing it, I saw the driver.

His head was smoky grey and skeletal, with white fire blazing in his empty eye sockets. He wore a matte black firesuit, a skull-and-crossbones insignia adorning the shoulder The suit was burning with black flames, but the seat of the car was undamaged. His hands were covered by tattered gloves, which concealed only parts of the bones. Through my open windows, I felt a sudden chill, and my instrument panel fogged up. I looked, horrified, into the face of Death, and my vision tunneled. In a split second, I saw my family and friends standing by my graveside, growing older and dying before falling into the open pit. I blinked, but a vision of my wife appeared. She held a flaming torch, and cursed me as she swung it at my head. I screwed my eyes shut once again, and the shrieks of my dead friends were replaced with the banshee-scream of the hellish car beside me. The death’s-headed driver looked at me and smiled, his moon-bleached teeth as bright as welding torches. He raised a black sawn-off shotgun, and I turned away, shifting into high gear. The Camaro was hot on my heels, but I could hear the wailing recede as I powered down the straightaway. His V8 roar mixed with the hair-raising banshee-sound, but my car was faster through the corners, and I took full advantage. I could see Death, his evil, hollow face twisted into an angry grimace as he slammed on the gas. I hit the next corner hard, drifting around the hairpin as my rear tires spun and cried out in protest. I could hear myself cursing and screaming in abject terror as my tail end almost hit the guardrail, but I managed to recover and my tires miraculously regained traction. My straight-six belted out its gravelly song and, emboldened, I mashed the clutch and upshifted just as Death’s Camaro cleared the turn. He opened his throttle wide, but I had the advantage this time. Looking down the road, I saw another hairpin corner leading into a long, winding descent. I stood on the brake and put the clutch in, sliding smoothly through the turn, and let the clutch out as I opened the throttle. My M3 screamed down the mountainside, leaving Death in the dust. I didn’t slow down for ten minutes, when, to my surprise, the lights of my small town appeared around a shallow turn. I looked behind me and saw the black Camaro, stopped about a quarter-mile back, smoke coming out of its hood scoop. Death stood regally in the moonlight, his arm up in a terrifying salute. I turned the corner and, when I next looked back, the car and its driver had disappeared.

I arrived back at my small house, and pulled the M3 into the driveway. I climbed out, a grin on my face. After all, I had just faced down Death and won. How bad could a whiskey-throwing woman be?

The night started out as normal as it could for a cab driver, picking random people up to go to the hot spots of Las Vegas.  It wasn't until Steve found himself on the seedy side streets of the Vegas strip that he started to feel uneasy.  It was closing in on the end of his shift and he decided on doing one last fare for the night.  An old Japanese business man entered the car, dressed in a nice brown suit holding a briefcase.

""I've got quite the distance to go, Baker is my destination do you know of it?"" The Japanese man said sternly wiping his brown with a handkerchief.

""No, can you give good directions?""  Steve said, he said with an exhausted tone.

""I will give explicit directions, please follow them precisely as told.  Failure will result in no tip."" The Japanese man griped his briefcase tightly with his hands.  Steve could see his black eyes in the reflection of his rear view mirror, it sent a shudder down his spine.

""You're the boss"" And with that Steve lurched the Taxi forward and onto their destination. 

Time passed as Steve drove silently in the darkness of the Nevada desert.  The directions given to Steve sent his taxi out of the comforts of the city lights.  His mind blurred with ""left here"" ""right up ahead"" and ""Turn around you messed up!"" quickly got him lost.  Steve cautiously drove up the surrounding mountains that engulfed Vegas.

""I'm going to call dispatch to give them a heads up I'm out of our area"" Steve's voice was nervous and eagerly anticipated the sound of his boss back at the taxi garage.  As Steve pressed the button on the side of his walkie-talkie he gave a quick update, to his dismay there was only static coming from the other end.  ""Damnit!"" Steve threw down the receiver onto the ground.  ""This area is pretty treacherous at night, are you sure you know where we are going?""

""Yes, please don't question me."" Steve was looking in his rear-view mirror and saw the black stains on the Japanese mans teeth.  It looks as if tar was caked onto them.

""Well then about how much longer till we get there?"" Steve inquired, he started to accelerate the car in hopes that they would get to their destination faster.

""Soon, please have patience"" The Japanese man said coolly.  The Japanese man slid his briefcase onto the seat next to him and opened it.  He pulled out a long and shiny blade.

Steves eyes caught a glimpse of it in the rear view mirror, his heart beat quickened and he started to sweat a little.  ""What exactly are you going to do with that?""

The Japanese man started to laugh a little ""Up ahead you're going to have to make a hard left, please be prepared.""

The mountain pass was getting more and more treacherous and Steve kept slowly getting faster and faster.  The Japanese man stared at the blade in his hands.  ""Don't forget to turn here"" The Japanese man held up the blade jumped forward to stab Steve.  Steve quickly jerked around to fight off the Japanese man but he wasn't there.  Suddenly realizing he took the eyes off the road Steve jerked the wheel hard to the left the car was suddenly airborne.  It crashed off the side of the mountain and exploded into a great fire ball.  

The next night a taxi cab pulled up to the side of the road in a dark alley in Vegas.  An old Japanese business man slinked into the back seat holding a briefcase.  The driver asked ""Where are you going tonight.""  The Japanese man smiled, his black teeth chattered "" I've got quite the distance to go, Baker is my destination do you know of it?""

They were always pressuring me into things, or pranking me, which hurts, because I've never been...""stable"". 

     By that i mean, I had nightmares as a child, and sometimes even now i have those horrid dreams. Dreams about things chasing me particularly. Long, thin figures with twisted smiles and blood-stained clothing. But back to my friends. They had been experimenting with psychedelics since Sophomore year, and wanted me to do them, but I'd always refused. Until now. I caved. I didn't like being ""uncool.""  I hated being called a pussy.

     They gave me acid. For around an hour i sat, anxious. I was thinking about my nightmares. They seemed more prominent than ever. In the front of my mind they sat there. I wanted it out. I didn't want to have a bad trip. At this point my friends were loopy. I didn't feel a thing. Then i hit the wall. I went ballistic. I was being chased by everything I'd ever been afraid of. I ran outside screaming at the top of my lungs.

     My friend mark, who had always taken up for me, even when my other ""friends"" pranked me or made fun of me, bolted after me. I ran and ran and ran. I didn't know where i was but i wanted out. Mark yelled at me to stop. I couldn't. He was gaining on me. I ran harder. He tackled me onto the ground and wrestled me until i was ""calm"". I stood up and he began to explain.

""Bro, chill out, you ARE NOT tripping.""

""what?!"" I screamed frantically

""We know about your phobia. We couldn't let you drop acid, it was only paper.""

""Then why did i freak?""

""You thought you were tripping. It's fine man."" He said, beginning to walk off.

""Okay, i think i need some time alone."" I said, slowly letting my guard down.

""You sure?""

""I'll be just fine.""

I sat there. It seemed like days. The darkness enveloped me. I couldn't see anything, I didn't want to see anything. But i could hear. That's what i was afraid of. Every rustle, snap, and chirp made me uneasy.I felt the eery tension rising.

""It's nothing, I'm alone.""

                        Prologue
                ""The Normal Life?""

The night was cold, frigid, and dark. Air bit at any opening of flesh it could find with extreme freezing prejudice. The streets were empty, no people, no cars, no one. Except for me.... Let me give you a little back story before I continue. My name is Jonathan, I have a wife Colleen and one daughter Althea Alicia. I was a Marine, I transferred from active duty to reserves  in 2009 due to my wife giving birth to our first child. So I worked as security for extra money except during my monthly and annual trainings when I would head back to Camp Pendleton each summer to train. 5 years have passed since then and I EAS in a few weeks I've done 12 years in the Corps and loved every moment of it but I have a family now. So I decided it was time for me to leave. And I did those weeks passed by fast. I had served my Country and the Corps, I was deployed many times and had lost plenty of friends. But anyway back to the story.

I was just relieved of my post at the guard's shack in front of the old abandoned glass factory. I know, why the hell does an abandoned factory need guarding. Well there is plenty of expensive machinery still owned by the old company and they don't want it being stolen or destroyed. So they hired the security company I worked for to guard it while they pretty much left all they owned right in the building. I didn't care I just did my job so I could give my family a good life.

So I here I am walking down this street in the cold, why? Because I knew if my wife ever had an emergency she would need the car. So I would walk home from work.
Every night,  like clockwork. Tonight was different though. Each step felt like I was stepping away from safety and into some type of hell. I wasn't one to be fearful but something felt.... Wrong. And I didn't understand it. So I just kept trudging through the snow and mud.

It took longer than normal to get home that night since the snow was deep, and I stopped to look around a few times. But I made it, there was the front door. All the lights in the house were off. I assumed the porch light was left on for me by my wife. I entered the house only to find dead silence. It was later than usual so I thought nothing of it closed an locked the door and switched the front porch light off.

I snuck into my daughters room and kissed her forehead and stared for what seemed like hours but was only minutes. She was such a beautiful young girl. I loved her and I would die for her without a moments notice. Same with my wife. My wife? The thought of her beautiful brown eyes led me to our room. She was laying in bed obviously sleeping. So I curled up behind her for a while and tried to sleep. I slipped into what seemed like a deep sleep. Although, I knew tonight was going to be a very.... restless..... night.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,1373591593.0,,,True,t3_1i2efg,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i2efg/normal_life_prologue/,

If you don't like it, then try not to down vote the shit out of me, this was just for fun. Keep in mind this is my first creepy pasta!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is wisconson12, and I'm you're typical ""Not-so-scared-of-anything"" kind of guy.  But sometimes, I think I'm cursed. Honestly, I just don't wanna deal with the bullshit of everyday life, but all these strange (one might say scary) things happen to me. This is my encounter with slenderman.

On a regular summer night, I just woke up from a nap around 9:45 PM (I fell asleep watching Burn Notice, so shut up.) So like any regular teenager, I checked my phone to see if anyone wanted to hang. My buddy, we'll call him Buddy, texted me around 9 o'clock. We decided to meet up at his house and go for a late night walk. The catch was he with his girlfriend at the moment, so I decided to walk there to kill some time.

I depart from my house and notice the air is a little thicker than usual. It's a summer night so I took it as being a little more humid than normal. The way the moonlight hit the streets complimented the dark aura that loomed over the city. All I could think was how beautiful the city looks at night. I got a text saying Buddy was gonna be a little longer than expected (raw doggin' it) so I took a detour through the ghetto of my small urban environment. I had the sneaking suspicion that someone was watching me, but I live in constant paranoia so it was nothing new.

This next part won't make sense, unless you know a little history about myself. A year ago my grandfather died from cancer, and since then, lights in the house flicker on and off. But we all joke that it's him talking to us. So as I was walking down an empty street, I noticed a flickering streetlight that was dimmer than the rest. Thinking nothing of it I continued walking until I was directly under the light. And in that moment, it stopped flickering and then ominously shined on my face, as if brighter than the rest. Was this a warning? I could no longer deny the fact that someone was watching me, but why me? I'm nothing special. Off in the distance I noticed another dim light, but this one wasn't flickering. At first I mistook the figure for a tree sapling growing behind a lamp post, it was tall, thin limbs and it was very dark. It must've been a newer tree because I'm in the area a lot, and didn't recognize it. What was off about the tree was it struck an unnatural curiousity, I wanted to walk towards it. My phone ringing directed my attention away from the scene down the road.

Buddy was gonna meet me at McDonalds. We immediately started talking about Hannaford, the grocery store I work at. Buddy used to work there with me, until he was asked to quit by management.. (What brought up the topic was the forgotten box cutter I left in my pocket.) Fast forward past a couple McGangbangs later, and we're back on the streets. We walked back the same way I came, and found the blinking streetlight again. This time, it went out. On the ground was a note, it simply has a picture of what I had thought to be a tree, with X's for eyes.

Now I know who slenderman is, but, I never really figured he would come after me. So he was not in the forefront of my mind. Buddy on the other hand, knew exactly what the picture meant. We brushed it off as kids playing a game, or some kind of joke on each other. I didn't really wanna bother with it. I did notice that the new tree was gone. Well, not gone, but moved. I told this to Buddy, and he urged me to check it out. I told him it was a waste of time, but there wasn't much else to do.

Buddy convinced me to go and look at the tree. It moved over to a nearby park that had a fence bordering it's limits. Inside there was a soccer field and a jungle gym. I sat down on the swing while Buddy searched for the tall being. ""It's probably slenderman, let's go home,"" I said jokingly. But I didn't hear a response. In fact, I couldn't hear anything, nothing but a faint and indistinguishable sound. It sounded vaguely like white noise, from a radio that was not tuned to a station. The next thing I saw was Buddy dangling from a tree, tied up with some kind of black arm. I guess I was right, it was slenderman. ""Fuck"" I thought to myself. I really did not want to deal with this shit tonight. I had to free the expressionless Buddy from the clutches of this demon, so I did. I didn't actually see slenderman anywhere, so I climbed the tree in an attempt to free Buddy. 

Then I woke up. It was all a dream. Just a stupid dream, or was it? When I finally cam,e to my senses, I realized I was in trash bag with an unconscious Buddy being carried up a hill. I remember him telling me slenderman likes to gut his victims and leave there inside in garbage bags, so I knew I had to act. Remembering the box cutter, I effortlessly cut myself free and stabbed into slendermans back. He turned and looked into my empty soul, I didn't flinch. I could tell he was shocked. I mean who actually hurts slenderman? I got this sense of victory. I scared slenderman, I won. But he'll be back, and he won't be alone. My name is wisconson12, and I'm just your average ""not-so-scared-of-anything"" kind of guy, and slenderman is no exception. If there is one thing I've learned from this, it's I'm definitely cursed.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,t3_1i0u37,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i0u37/not_so_creepy_pasta/,

-----------------------------------------------------------
After walking for what felt like days in the twisted maze, Hansel and Gretel thought they were going to starve to death. They were covered in bite wounds from animals and cuts and scrapes from various obstacles. During the day, the air was hot and unbearable, and during the night, it was freezing cold. There was no way to cheat, because they knew the witch was watching their every move. Even if they could surpass the witch, the walls were still 12 feet high into the air. All seemed hopeless. They were literally living off of strange berries that could potentially be life threateningly poisonous and unusually colored water that sometimes made them feel nauseous. One day -the hottest day so far- Hansel and Gretel were walking down a long, cave-like corridor. All was quiet; *too* quiet. It was very unsettling. Off in the distance they could hear barking and the sound of something with large claws running. After awhile of listening to the thing run, they realized that it now sounded like it was on the other side of the wall. All that 'thing' had to was turn left, and there it would be. ""RUN"" Shouted Gretel, starting to take off, but because the witch fattened up Hansel, he couldn't run very fast. Gretel hadn't noticed her brother falling behind, so she kept on running. All the sudden, she heard intense screaming from behind. She turned around to see a gigantic wolf-like creature standing over her shrieking brother. ""**HANSEL!**"" Gretel shouted at the top of her lungs. ""Go.. on.. without me..."" Hansel said, right before the giant red eyed wolf ripped his chest apart. ""NO!"" She yelled right before she started to run, blinded with tears.

I shivered; the cold was seeping through my whole body, making me feel icy and insecure at the same time. This is the classic setting for a horror movie, I thought to myself. My mother was out working late at the hospital. She works as a dialysis nurse on a midnight shift, leaving me home for the night. My father went to get some milk, and I guess he couldn’t find any, because that was six years ago.  Usually on these nights where my mother is on a shift, I sit in front of the television stuffing my face with food and watching the latest episode of The Big Bang Theory. However, tonight it’s a rerun, and I’m bored with this episode. Damn, there’s no food! I think when I check the fridge. What a shit night this will be….

ELSEWHERE:
‘It’s time for me to feed. Blood, I must have it. In any way possible, it will be mine. There is no human that will deny me my blood, no human that will stop me! Blood, blood….’

I log onto my computer, using my yahoo account. ‘Facebook, yahoo, crap, crap…’ nothing interesting. I search the web for a little longer, jumping at the sound of loud thunder outside the house. The light flashed, blinked, flickered. There was something about the rain tonight, something about the ferocity and tempo in which the rain came down at that made me uneasy. I went into my mother’s room at the end of the long hallway, opening the double door entrance. I went into our camera room, a small room filled with three or four screens full of camera feed, pointing at specific locations around and inside the house. Having seen nothing out of the ordinary, I exited the camera room and headed back to the television, flicking between channels. Suddenly, a bright flash and a boom shook the house; rattling the windows and making me jump in fright. What a terrible night this is turning out to be.


'Blood, I smell it, I smell it… so close. Come to me, I shall feed. I need your blood….'


The lights flicker again, dimming the house, plunging me in darkness for what seemed like an eternity. I moved around a bit, trying to find my way to the kitchen. Stumbling around in the kitchen, I ambled over to the fridge and opened the door, letting out the small bulb of light in the fridge. Light shone out, covering a very small radius of t	he living room. ‘Pathetic’, I grumbled. I closed the fridge door and made my way to the couch in darkness, planning on waiting the power failure out. Suddenly, a sharp spear of pain stabbed my stomach, and I doubled over and fell onto the carpet floor. I groaned and I checked my body but there was no extrusion of a sharp object. There was no one around me either (Why should there be?!). I relaxed and laid on the floor, realising I was covered in sweat. Whatever just happened, it was scary. I’m going to have to tell mother about this, she’ll help me. I stood up slowly, breathing out hard. I sat on the couch and got my breath back, dismissing this event as a one off, an odd occurrence. However I didn’t feel safe anymore. My own home had been breached and I felt like I was not alone. Nonsense Liam, pull yourself together, I told myself. Can this night be any worse? 


‘I can sense blood…I can almost taste it in my mouth, dribbling down my chin. My thirst is insatiable, I must have every drop in his little body. Soon…’

I’m sweating profusely, and I have no idea why. I’m lying face down on the couch, but I will myself to get up. The house is still dark, so I stumble and find my way to my mother’s bedroom, collapsing in the chair in the CCTV room. I breathe heavily, but I realise the CCTV cameras are still going. They must be going on some backup power, for security purposes I guess. I study the screens, looking for anything unusual. The only thing that’s unusual is that I’m sitting in the dark, staring at camera screens. As I look around the screens, I suddenly see a small window I’ve never seen before. It has a little play button on the slightly blurry image. I click play and enlarge it, staring at the recording on the screen. It’s a grainy recording of a boy sitting at his computer desk in the dark. The video is recording from the back of the room, so I can only see the boy watching something on his desk. I notice suddenly a humanoid shape, pale, barely noticeable in the dark, slowly crawling on all fours towards the boy. With a shiver, I realise this shape resembles a small girl, black hair and very pale. The boy is continuing to stare at his screen, somewhat transfixed at whatever is on it. I want to scream to him, to tell him to turn around, but whatever will happen has happened. It’s getting closer and closer, raising itself higher as it gets closer to the boy in the darkness. I am scared for the boy, and I don’t want to watch, yet I am transfixed. Suddenly, I notice something that stops my heart. In the corner of the video screen, I see a four letter word that pierces right through my brain. Live. 

This boy…this boy on the screen…is me.	


‘BLOOD!’

It's been so long since my family moved here, and yet every road is something that anyone would eventually learn, especially when you never learned how to drive. But here I am, walking the familiar paved ways home, after my friends ditched me after a party twelve miles back. My legs are burning, and my feet are screaming but I'm almost home. I've been walking for hours, but I'm almost home. I have to remind myself of that, because all I want is to get home, and get to bed. Doesn't help that it's raining cats and dogs, and I can barely see a damn thing.

Even when I'm this far out from home, I can tell where everything is. It's second nature to me now, I guess. Every step, every landmark, all along a memory trail of isolation and frozen places in time inside my head. But this rain isn't making things any easier, and my feet are starting to grow heavier with every lift and fall. Gotta get home, though. Don't want to be stuck outside in this rain any longer than I should. Gotta get inside, and warm up. Get to bed. Get some rest.

As the rain stings my eyes, I stop by the side of an old dilapidated farm house, lights barely visible in the falling veil that blocks my view. This home belonged to Mr. Hansel, an old farmer that lived there with his wife and kids. About four years ago, everyone was celebrating his 63rd birthday, and he was given the knife to cut the cake. AS he was about to stick the blade in the pastry, his wife drew him in for a kiss. Without warning mid-romantic gesture, his body fell forward, driving the blade deep into his wife, as he fell down, dead on top of her. The coroners that handled his autopsy gave the diagnosis that he had a sudden, and fatal aneurysm that toppled him like a ragdoll, forcing the knife deeply into his wife's chest, killing her as well. The family was completely devestated, and they tried to sell the property as quickly as possible. But they forgot that they lived in a small town. And in small towns, rumors and causes spread faster than truth and reason. To this day, half the town still believes that he killed his wife in a fit of passion, and that his anger and frustration caused him to have his fatal episode. Many also purport that the farmhouse is haunted, and that's why people put a light up in the farm house, as to guide their spirits home, and to an eternal rest.

""No rest for the wicked"" in a small town, huh?

My feet begin to twinge as they told me to move on, and get home as soon as possible. So I wearily close my eyes, and take my steps. I count each step, knowing I'm getting closer to my goal. One, two, three, four, fifteen, twenty eight. And then something tells me to stop. And when I open my eyes, I see why: I'm in front of my old elementary school, Grover Graves, which is 6 miles from my home. Grover Graves founded the school back in 1948, after having come back from war, and earning enough in odd jobs to give local kids an opportunity. In the 1960's, when desegragation was beginning to take place, Graves was one of the first people to sign his school up for the program. It's funny that a mere decade later, in 1974, Graves took his own life, after having suffered from depression and Parkinson's Disease, both of which having increased in severity beginning in 1968.

""Keep walking,"" is all I can hear my feet tell me, as I continue on in this torrential downpour that seemingly buries everything living in dead in a blanket of tears. ""Keep walking. You must get home."" So I lift my leaden feet, and continue my trek come.

I try to count the steps again. One two, three, eleven, twenty nine, forty eight, one hundred and thirty four, two hundred and sixty one. At three hundred and fifty six, I suddenly find myself stopping once again. This time, I'm in front of Sherry Bullmont's home. Sherry's my girlfriend. Well, I should really say ""ex-girlfriend"". She really cared for me, even since we were little kids. I don't know if it was our parents trying to hook us up, or if it was just fate that we'd become so close, but we did. She was like a warm sun on a rainy day. No matter what would happen, she'd always be there for me. She was my shoulder, and my comfort. And I was a fucking idiot for cheating on her like I did. It took us nearly eighteen years to finally meet each other like we were supposed to, and I ruined it in one night. Less than a year together, and nineteen years of being with the one person I really cared about destroyed because I was a fucking asshole. I can feel myself crying right now, as I stand in front of her darkened home. She moved away, and she wouldn't tell me where. She's gone, and I have no one to blame but myself.

It's time like now that I wish I was dead.

My legs begin to spasm, and the rain begins to fall harder than before. I can't even see in front of my face, and yet I know that I'm close to home. ""Close your eyes, and just walk"" is the only thing I can tell myself to do. ""You know these roads. Get home."" And I follow my own words. I close my eyes, and begin to count my steps again. One, two, three, twenty four, sixty seven, one hundred and eleven, two hundred and fourty six. At two hundred and forty seven, I open my eyes, and I think that I can see my mailbox! It's not far!
