Somebody at your lunch table being a dick? Don't want to get in trouble for beating their ass? Fucking slip them some gum so they'll quit bothering you.

As long as you don't chew gum as loud as a rhinoceros stomps and keep your mouth somewhat closed, you'll look pretty damn cool chewing it.

Of course it helps with breath and all that shit.

Great way to get everyone's attention.

Why the fuck don't you have gum? Go to Costco/Sams and buy a fuck ton, because you will be like a drug overlord in your school with all that fucking gum. Hell, you might make a gum selling business.

Seriously, go get sum gum.

1326230344.0,537,self.teenagers,obbth,Nearly 18. Here's what I wish people had told me.,Bearasaur,636,99,245,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/obbth/nearly_18_heres_what_i_wish_people_had_told_me/,"Never thought I'd make it, honestly. It feels weird being an ""older teen."" I've done a ton of crazy shit in the last four years, and I think I've come out of it relatively well adjusted, so here are my tips for making it through your teenage years. This is the most complete guide I could come up with, so I hope it's useful.

**Parents**

1. Be nice to them. I can't stress this enough. They're people too, and having a teenager is fucking scary. If you give them grief you're really going to regret it later in life.

2. It takes time to build trust. Don't expect it to happen overnight, no matter what you do. Just because you know you're responsible doesn't mean they do. You just have to keep showing them you know how to handle yourself and hope for the best.

3. Remember: they almost certainly have all kinds of problems of their own. If you think they don't, it's because they don't want you to know about them.

4. Talk to your parents about their lives before you. Sometimes your parents were actually insanely cool back in the day. It also helps your relationship with them. Parents trust you a lot more when they know you understand where they're coming from.

5. Learn to recognize when they're right and when they're wrong. Just because they're wrong about some things (or even a lot of things) doesn't mean their wrong about everything.

**School**

1. Remember that your teachers aren't all on the same team. Make friends with at least one, and they'll put in a good word for you if you really fuck up. You'll probably never find out about it, but they will.

2. Cursive is no more useful than print. Learn it anyway. Use it instead of printing. You *will* score points with the English teacher.

3. Don't tell yourself you hate a teacher, or you're bad at a subject, or a homework assignment is pointless. It does no good and turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

4. Join clubs. Even if they're stupid and a waste of time and not really that fun, it will make it so much easier to get into college. Besides, you'll make friends and won't have to spend as much time at home.

5. Sophomore year is usually the hardest. Senior year is usually the easiest. Keep that in mind, especially when you're a freshman.

**Friends**

1. You're gonna go through a lot of friends. It's totally normal to have entirely new friends every semester. If that's not the case, congrats, but don't be too shaken up if you lose some eventually.

2. Just because someone gives you shit doesn't mean they mean it. If your friends call you a nerd for skipping out on basketball to do homework, they don't actually think you're a nerd. Take care of your shit no matter what people say.

3. Try not to conform to a stereotype. Just because you like math and science doesn't mean you can't play football too. Listening to Justin Bieber doesn't mean you have to be a vapid fangirl (note: not a Bieber endorsement).

4. When you talk to people, ask questions about them. People, especially teenagers, love to talk about themselves. Along those lines, don't talk about yourself too much. It can kind of annoy people.

5. Watch out for people who ""hate drama."" They attract a lot of it.

6. Know when someone is a lost cause. If your friend is depressed, has a drug problem, etc, you should absolutely try to help them; *however*, only to the extent that it doesn't fuck up your life too. This applies to boyfriends/girlfriends as well, probably even more so.

**Things Your Parents Don't Want You To Do (Vices)**

1. Drinking. If you do it, learn to be a safe drinker. Drink to have fun, not to forget your problems. That's how alcoholics happen. Drink a lot of water before and/or after your alcohol. **NEVER** drive, no matter how much trouble you'll get in if you don't. Know your limit. Never drink the cheapest stuff at the liquor store, it'll make you sick (plastic bottle/aluminum can is almost also a hangover recipe).

2. Tobacco is seriously addictive, and no matter how against it you think you are there will be times when you think about trying it. Don't. You probably won't get addicted the first time, but it doesn't even feel that good. The smoke is harsher than weed and the high is not as good. It is really not worth it.

3. Weed is fun, but be smart. Never smoke or buy weed at school. Never ditch school to smoke. Don't store your stash in the house or your parents *will* find it sooner or later (a piece of advice from my brother). Remember that unfiltered smoke is bad for your lungs, and if you really insist on smoking a lot, get a vaporizer. If someone wants you to smoke but you don't want to, tell them it makes you paranoid. They'll back off.

4. Stealing isn't necessarily bad, but it is *not* worth it. If you get caught your parents will find out no matter what. The law makes no exceptions. If you're not going to take my advice here, at least never steal anything worth more than $25. The fines increase significantly past that amount. 

*Note:* Some people had a problem with my views on stealing. Obviously I think you should believe what you want. I'm not condoning stealing from people, houses, et cetera, and definitely not from smaller businesses. However, box stores (ie: Target) often employ shady business tactics and I think stealing from them constitutes a moral grey area, something that is neither inherently right or inherently wrong. Either way my advice is not to do it.

**Relationhips**

Many of these are guy-specific. I have some notes for girls in the continuation comment.

1. Don't get with your friend's ex. Ever. You probably shouldn't even hang out with her, because you might reach the point of no return without even realizing it.

2. BE. CONFIDENT. Don't apologize for things before she even brings them up. Don't say things like, ""I know I don't really talk to you much, but..."" Don't talk shit on yourself. Whether or not a girl is into you is her decision, not yours. Your job is to give her the opportunity, and yeah, sometimes it puts you in kind of an awkward place. You'll get over it.

3. If you want to date a girl you don't hang out with, just ask her to go bowling with you or something. The number one concern I hear when I tell people this is ""but then she'll know I like her!"" No shit. That's the point.

4. Don't bend over backwards for a girl. Being *too nice* is a one way ticket to the friend zone. I'm not saying you should be a dick to her, but don't cancel plans with your friends just because she wants to do something else.

5. When you break up, it's not the end of the world. If you think she's the perfect girl for you, you're probably wrong. On the off chance you're right, you're not going to know that while you're a teenager, so you might as well move on.

6. Don't try to find a girl with exactly your tastes. It's not gonna happen. Surprisingly, the perfect girl for you probably has shitty taste in music. Attraction is partially based on mutual interests, but it's far from the whole story.

**Clothes for Guys**

Clothes for girls is in the continuation comment.

1. Skin-tight or baggy jeans look really bad. Levi's fits are pretty much the point of reference - go to the site and look at them. 510 is too tight. 511 and 513 are really stylish. 501 is too baggy for teenagers. 514 works in the South. Chinos (AKA khakis) can look good if you get the right kind and wear them well. Otherwise stick with dark-but-still-blue jeans. Bright colored skinny jeans are something you're really, *really* going to regret in five years.

*Note:* From the comments I realized that I failed to mention 511's *are* skinny jeans. 510's are super skinny, which is common for teenagers and should be avoided. 511's (regular skinnies) look more masculine and more people can pull them off; super skinnies only look decent on about 5-10% of people who wear them. And if you're closer to my size (6', 170lbs, 32x34 pant), wear 513's or similar.

2. Don't wear stupid graphic tees. Band shirts are cool, but pretty much anything on the graphic tee shelf at Target looks really lame (their plain tees are a pretty good for the price though). If it has skulls on it, do not wear it. *Update:* Just to drive the point home, skulls, wings, fancy text, fleurs de lis - all pretty defining characteristics of a douchebag.

3. Fit is more important than anything. When you buy clothes, make sure they are flattering for your body type. For example, Chucks (Converse) are really popular, but don't look good on people with big feet (above size 10 or so).

4. /r/malefashionadvice is really helpful and very welcoming to teenagers. They'll tell you what's up. Ignore the fact that some of them buy $300 shoes.

5. Hats look bad on a lot of people. Knit caps are the only kind most people can pull off, and for teenagers knit caps with ears and tassels and stuff are okay. Stetsons, bowlers, berets, etc almost always look *really* awful.

6. Buy long sleeve button up shirts, never short sleeve. If you want shorter sleeves, roll them up. Plaid is popular and definitely a great starting point, but don't shy away from other patterns (vertical stripes, plain, and checkered are all pretty acceptable).

This is inspired by my post over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1darhc/i_rteenager_i_was_wondering_how_did_you_get_a/)

I know all this is useless information to you guys, but I want to document my joy, so here goes:

I'm 17, she's 17. I'm only in one of her classes. Since I first met her in my third year of high school, I thought she was so pretty. In the last year, I lost 100 pounds and turned out to be pretty good looking. I finally built up the courage to ask her out. She didn't know me too well, I didn't know her too well. She's pretty, kind and beautiful so that's what I told her. With my stupid little english accent I walked up to her and told her. ''Hi (GIRL'S NAME HERE), I know this is pretty much out of nowhere, but I find you very, very pretty and very kind and smart, and I would be very happy if you agreed to come with me for a movie and some food'' And she said yes. Our date is this weekend.

The best part of this is when I got home a friend of mine told me she actually has found me really good looking for a while. 

I'm too happy about this. If you have someone out there, ask them out.

It's worth it.

They liked what they heard, and wanted to re-release some of my old tracks (from [various](http://drainpuppet.bandcamp.com/album/green) [free](http://drainpuppet.bandcamp.com/album/goodnight) [releases](http://drainpuppet.bandcamp.com/album/adventure)) as a not-free album on beatport. Now they're a [small label.](http://www.facebook.com/hopskotchrecords?fref=ts) But, you have to start somewhere, right?

So, I accepted. Emailed them back. It sounded like a good idea, make a bit of money, get promo'd by a label, get a mastered album of some of my best-written tunes charting on beatport. I liked the sound of that. They told me what tracks they wanted. I accepted. I sent them the 24bit integer .wavs with -6db of headroom, and then waited for them to get everything in order.

They had it mastered, got the art done, made me sign a contract -nothing sketchy or binding, just me agreeing that they had the rights to release my album under their label and that I wouldn't sue them- and gave me the release date. Feb 18th.

Today is February 18th. Today my first signed EP was released.

[Drainpuppet - Headache EP](http://www.beatport.com/release/headache/1037541). Tell me what you think, and buy it if you like it. Thanks :D

What we call beautiful would be considered normal without ugly people, so for one, it's not possible for EVERYONE to be beautiful. Also, it doesn't matter. So you have a big ass. Good for you. Is that going to solve an energy crisis, short of a twerk-porewed generator? No. Yes, I'll probably initially have a better opinion of an attractive person than an unattractive one. However, if you're well-mannered, I won't give a shit that it looks like a hobo performed a rhinoplasty on you with a socket wrench. Now, if you look like a mess because you don't take the time to not look sloppy, that does say something about your personality and I'll have no problem judging you for that. However, being hot will get you almost nothing unless you plan on going in to a field where good looks are necessary, in which case, your options are rather limited. Point being, chill. Stop trying so hard to be stunning. If you aren't, there isn't much you can do to change that. Not that it matters, anyway.

**DO NOT POST YOUR EXACT ADDRESS, ONLY YOUR CITY.**

Okay, now that that will hopefully deter any information-happy redditors, here's what this is- a google map, with pins representing users. Not only can you see who's near you, but it's also a cool representation of how diverse /r/teenagers is.

**Instructions:**  
1) Read the instructions through fully.  
2) Go to the link at the bottom of the page.   
3) Click the ""Add"" button in the top right.  
4) Put your username, and your username only, in the ""Entry Name"" section.  
5) Press the ""Click on a map location"" button.  
6) Drag the star to your approximate location.  
7) Check back later to see if anyone's near you.  
8) Upvote this post for visibility. I'm not getting any karma from it.

If all has gone well, we should soon have a tidy, nice visual map of /r/teenagers.

Also, for gods sake, don't just check to see who's near you and not put down your own marker.

Whether it's getting a job, a girlfriend, or some friends, confidence is key.. The problem is, you're just expected to *have* confidence; no one ever really tells you how to get it. I'm hoping to make all of you more confident people with the new /r/teenagers ""Project Big Balls"" (do you guys have any other suggestions? I'd like a cooler name.)

A while ago there was a similar project in /r/howtonotgiveafuck that I really liked so I thought I'd start something similar here. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I'll make a new post with a new challenge. In that same post, we will discuss the previous challenge: what happened, how well it went, etc. It should be fun and help you push the limits of your comfort zone. 

We will start with a challenge today so you have something to report back on Monday. This one is easy: make eye contact with three people and don't be the one to break it. Make sure at least one of them is a random stranger. It's our natural tendency to look away when we make eye contact; let the other person do it first. If three is too hard then just do *one*. You can do it!

As soon as I walked in and sat down at my computer, I knew trouble was brewing when the boy next to me slumped down in his seat with larger than life sweatpants and a pack of gum in his hands. He was already chewing a very large wad in his mouth, savoring the deliciousness in such a repulsive manner as you could hear the saliva churning in his mouth as he murdered it with his teeth. ""Ok,"" I thought to myself, ""it's only two hours long, I can make it through this."" I began organizing the papers in front of my computer and (tried) to listen to the instructor talk us through the tools we were given. 20 minutes after starting the test and I notice the boy hadn't made a single mouse click and was, in fact, sitting 4 feet away from the computer. I noticed he was staring very intensely at my screen too, so I took my dear time figuring out my answers. He's moving and kicking his feet and beating the wall with his fists. Why haven't they kicked him out yet? When suddenly he starts grunting. That's when I turned around and looked at him sternly. Until suddenly, to my disgust, I realized his arm was elbow deep into his pants, pumping up and down. I quickly turned around and worked quietly until our break halfway through. During our break, the kid peels his hand away from his pants and stand up to stretch, that's when I take my chance and talk to the older instructed nearby. I ask her of there's anyway I could move my seat because I couldn't focus on my test. I felt a lump in my throat as she told me it would be impossible to move me. I get back to working, he gets back to pumping. Luckily, one of my teachers were in the classroom and advised the instructor that I was never one to complain unless it was a serious problem. I spent the next portion of my test on the other side of the room and had quite a good laugh with my friends afterward.",,False,self,t5_2rjli,False,,,True,t3_1egjtz,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1egjtz/please_do_not_masturbate_during_exams_a_rantstory/,

Personally I love the stuff, but the way people talk about it gives the impression that weed can be used all the time, anytime. I feel that I need to give all of you guys some **unbiased** information on the negative side effects on weed.

All psychoactives mess around with brain chemistry, sure this is fine for a fully developed brain, but can be harmful to a developing brain such as ourselves.

Also there is a myth that smoking weed will cause no problems for your lungs. All types of smoke will cause lung damage whether it's tobacco, weed, or burning wood.

I am not some person telling you weed is a bad drug to be taking, but everyone should do research for themselves before ingesting any drug.

Don't trust information that is relayed on to you, don't even trust me, research information for yourselves and make sure it's from a credible source. Stay safe [/r/teenagers](/r/teenagers) 

I am not some person telling you weed is a bad drug to be taking, but everyone should do research for themselves before ingesting any drug. For anyone who has an interest in using any drugs please read up on this site for **unbiased** information on any drug [erowid.org](http://www.erowid.org/)

EDIT: i just realized I'm going to get downvoted for this haha oh well, just hope you got the message that weed isn't perfect for our still developing brains.

1373725237.0,340,self.teenagers,1i7v2n,It's been 1 year.,,425,85,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1i7v2n/its_been_1_year/,"So on this day one year ago, a really good friend of mine committed suicide. I don't think anybody saw it coming, she genuinely seemed happy with her life. She was the type of person that would always listen to everyone else's problems and do her best to give them advice or help them out. She's the reason I have any self confidence, because whenever I wondered why I never had any luck with girls, she was honest with me and said its because I'm too nice. 

But things weren't as they seemed. She hung herself in her room last year. She had written a last goodbye before doing it, saying that people shouldn't be sad, she wouldn't want that. She was just doing this because while everyone always relied on her to make themselves feel better, nobody ever cared to ask her how she was doing. How she felt when she didn't make our girls basketball team. Or how she felt when her parents argued every night (they're divorced now). She didn't have anyone to lean on like we all did with her.

The worst part is, she had tried to call me before doing it. I had a missed call from her at 8:13pm. According to the official report, her time of death was around 9 that night. I missed her call because I was fucking bowling. She tried to reach out to me in her last moments, and I missed it.

I went to her funeral. It was sunny, luckily, so you figure plenty of people would be able to come. But plenty of people didn't come. It was her family, myself, and two other friends. Even in death, nobody cared to reach out for her.

This isn't a post to gain pity. I don't want it. This is a post to say that if any of you are ever depressed or need advice, you can talk to me. There are people that care about your well-being. I might not know you personally, but I know that there are those that could spiral into depression if you were to lose your life. So for the sake of their mental safety and your own safety, please reach out before its too late. 

There are places that can help. Several subreddits, I can't think of them now that I'm typing this, but I'm sure someone will link to them in the comments. 

I hope all of you have a great Saturday, and a great life.

Show auntie a picture of the puppy on your phone!""

Okay. Sure.

I walk over with my phone and bring up a picture of my dog to show her. I hold my phone up in the perfect position to just show her and she takes my phone from my hands.

DAMMIT. DON'T TAKE MY PHONE. YOU COULD SEE THE PICTURE WITHOUT HAVING TO TOUCH MY PHONE.

But okay, fine. I guess I'll get over it. 

I look away for one second and when I look back she is scrolling through *all* of my fucking pictures.

I don't even have anything bad to hide on my phone. The only thing that I'm uncomfortable with people seeing is the selfies I have. 

I attempt to subtlety take back my phone before she gets to any of them, so she squeezes my phone even tighter and begins scrolling faster so I can't take it back in a casual way.

FUCK YOU BITCH, so I pulled my phone away really hard and walked away.

-Who the hell gave you permission to look at any of my other photos without permission?

-What were you even expecting to find? I blatantly told you that it was the *only* picture I had of my dog.

-Don't take my phone. I did not hand it to you. You can easily look at the picture while its in my hand.

-LOOK AT THE DAMN PICTURE AND GIVE ME MY PHONE BACK.

I'm the one who brought the 4chan raiders, I'm the one who brought /r/braveryjerk. (My password wasn't goddamn 123456789, I'm not that stupid!) Why? Because I'm sick and tired of this sub-reddit. IT'S DEAD. It's finally evolved into it's final form of circlejerk and HALPP RELATIONSHITT and I'm just so tired, so, so tired of keeping this sub-reddit afloat.

So I decided to go out with a bang! It's been fun, it really has, but time has caught up with us and I must take my leave. As we are rapidly approaching 20,000 subscribers I wish the other moderators the best of luck with their endeavours and hope that the sub eventually becomes full-of-life like the way it used to be.

Meanwhile, I'll probably delete my account and start afresh. I'm quite grief-stricken by my decisions but I'll take them in confidence as I know that their is no return from the consequences I have brought forth to you all.

THEY DO NOT APPLY TO ALL SITUATIONS AND SHOULD BE ADAPTED TO FIT YOURS. HOWEVER, THE ADVICE WITHIN IS GOOD ADVICE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING YOUR COURSE OF ACTION. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW ""GENERAL"" OR ""INCORRECT"" OR ""UNHELPFUL TOWARDS ME"" IT IS IN THE COMMENTS, BECAUSE I CAN'T CREATE A GUIDE THAT FITS EVERYONE AND IS STILL EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND.**

There's a lot of people (myself included) who are tired of seeing lots of the same relationship questions here. Yeah, there's the odd individual and unique one but they all follow a similar vein. This is my attempt from my own meandering and anecdotal experience to sort your issues before they arise.

**Please note, this is a fairly general guide. The advice within is, in my opinion, good advice. However, as with most things, you will need to tailor it to suit you, as it is presented as simply as I can make it, and as such does miss out some of the detailed stuff in order to make it easy to digest.**

It's also important to note that High School relationships aren't the end of the world. They will (in most cases anyway) not last forever, and you shouldn't enter into them thinking they will. Of course there are exceptions to this, but they tend to be rare.

**I am confident most of this stuff is good quality. However, if anything is missing then leave a comment with what it is and why, and I'll edit it in. This is also general advice, adapt it slightly for your situational needs.**

Have edited to contain both genders, to make it more accessible for everyone.

There are a few topics I want to cover :
Getting into a relationship
In a relationship
Getting out of a relationship

**Getting into a relationship**

&gt;How do I know if s/he likes me?

That's a hard one. Generally, guys are more forthcoming (if they have the balls) and may ask you out. If not, if he's trying to talk to you lots, start conversations or see you outside of school, he's into you. 

Girls are tricky. They don't normally ask straight up (is a social convention type deal. Fuck social convention) but they will drop hints - maybe subtly ask you to hang out with them, maybe make excuses to see you, lingering eye contact or physical contact. Yes, I agree it's hard as anything to work out if it's interest or being nice.
If in doubt, **ASK HIM/HER**

&gt;I'm not ugly, but I wouldn't call myself attractive or striking. How do I draw his/her attention?

There's doubtless something interesting about you. Even if you're average looking, having a good personality is a massive plus, and I find that people with beautiful personalities are more attractive to me than those who're dicks. A sense of humour is also invaluable - if you've got a distinguishing feature (to steal MuffinMexican's example - he's shorter than average height) make jokes about it. Learn how to use self-depreciating humour in moderation - it shows that you're down to earth and such. **Don't be constantly doing yourself down. It's annoying and shows a lack of confidence, which is a huge turn-off for most people.**

&gt;How do I ask him/her out?

There is no magic phrase, or action you can do. Find something s/he's interested in that you also share and suggest you do it together. (This assumes you know her relatively well, but if not it's possible.) This first pseudo-date will be important - if you don't like how she acts or what she says now, chances are you'll have trouble later on.
If you like what you see, ask for another one, potentially a different activity. If she seems to enjoy that as well, then pop the ""Hey, wanna be my boy/girlfriend"" question.

**ASK HER** 

&gt;S/he rejected me, what do I do?

You need to respect his/her decision. S/he said no, you tried. At the end of the day, you can't - and shouldn't - force him/her. 
Yeah, it hurts and you will feel crappy about it, but there are plenty more fish in the sea - and the fact you asked makes you pretty damn ballsy anyway.

&gt;S/he has a boy/girlfriend but I want to replace him/he abuses her/etc

Woah, back off son. If she's taken, don't mess with that. You'd hate to be cheated on, so would he. Be a friend to him/her and maybe make a move if they break up and s/he's over him. But don't be that guy who breaks up a couple.
If her partner is a douche, don't tell him/her. Make sure you don't bitch about him/her, because s/he will find out. S/he will dislike you because her current b/gf is probably a good guy in his/her eyes.
If s/he's being abused by a b/gf and it's serious - assault etc - you need to inform the police or whomever can **LEGALLY** sort it. A criminal record sucks.

&gt;I feel too bad about myself to...

Sort it. Feel fat ? Join a gym/go running/eat more healthily. 
Basically, if you can sort it, sort it. No-one likes a moaning fanny. And, getting fit doesn't hurt.
If you can't sort it, ignore it or accept it. Got a massive spot that won't go away, or a birthmark? It's part of who you are, and it's not a big deal. I didn't even notice it :o Just be yourself, and be confident in yourself.
You could also get a new haircut, new cologne/perfume (but in moderation), shower daily etc.

**In a relationship**

&gt;How do I move it forward? It's stale/boring now...

Work out what is stale/boring and fix it. You need to sort problems as a couple as they arise. If it's just plodding along steadily, why is that bad ? If you're both happy it's all good.
To tackle this, **TALK TO HIM/HER** . Relationships only work with good communication.

&gt; I want to have sex, but s/he doesn't.

Ok. That's apparently more of a guy problem.
Remember, her happiness is paramount. You need to be respectful towards her - it is her decision. 
Ask her why she doesn't want to. But respect her. If you so much as lay a finger on her that she isn't happy with, you've instantly disrespected her.

Also,  Never, ever assume that one person is okay with it unless you've gotten verbal consent. Practice birth control (condoms, pill, IUD) and have talked to each other about that beforehand too. Right before you're about to do it, still check in with each other. 
But basically **TALK TO HIM/HER**

&gt;My G/BF is hot and lots of people hit on her.

Congratulations! You've got a beautiful/hot/attractive lady/not lady. Good for you.
As for the hitting on him/her, does it bother you? Why?
If you're jealous, that's OK to some extent - you want to protect your special bond with him/her. But it does become creepy at a point.
You need to trust him/her to avoid their advances. And if you can't trust him/her, you should not be in a relationship with him/her.
Also, don't make him/her feel bad about it. Physical appearance is one of those things that it's hard to change, and punishing him/her for it is just mean.
HOWEVER, if s/he's flirting back or anything that you're not okay with, that is something you need to talk to him/her about. 
**HAVE TRUST OR GET OUT**

&gt;S/he cheated on me but is sorry/can change/I don't wanna lose him/her.

RED FLAG. Personally, I would probably end it there and then. S/he breached your trust and that's a big deal.
You have to ask yourself if you can trust her. If so, then good. Power through, but never use it in an argument - you forgave him/her so it's done with.
However, do remember it *could* happen again. At that point, there's a massive issue since s/he's breached your trust twice. It'll only end badly, so I'd recommend getting out of there.

Alternatively, leave. You're a teenager. If you were an adult with two children and the both of you were willing to try, then maybe stay and work it out. Right now? You're under 20. There are so many people who are out there who won't cheat on you. 

**Getting out of a relationship**

&gt;I want to break up with him/her, but don't know how.

Why ? Ask yourself why you want out. If it can be fixed, fix it. Relationships are hard and do take work, so put the work in.
If you've tried and it failed to sort the issue, try again.
If that fails, you will need to break up with him/her.
HOW THOUGH?
Sit him/her down, alone and in a safe place, and talk to her. Explain what the problem is, admit your own fault and be nice about it.
DO NOT use cliches (E.G. It's not you, it's me) or email/text/phone/FB. That stings and she will hate you for it.

&gt;But I don't want to hurt her D:

Trust me, you'll hurt her more by dragging it out.
And if you can't find the balls to say it - remember, you had the balls to ask her out. You have the balls to let her down gently.

&gt;S/he broke up with me and I'll never find someone like him/her.

Aw you poor soul :(
Be sad for a while. That's part of the process. But pick yourself up after a week or two.
Moping for a year is a complete waste of time (trust me on this) because you'll only remember the good times. Move on and find your next relationship - be it in a month or a year.
 
Also, mourn the loss of a good thing (or maybe celebrate a little bit the bad being gone) and eventually realize that there are people out there like him/her, but better. You found one person once, your odds of finding another are very high.

**The Pillars of a Good Relationship**

You have to have a few things to get a good relationship.

1) Trust. If there is no trust, no relationship can happen.

2) Good communication (both talking and listening). If you can't communicate with her (as in, thoughts and feelings) then the relationship will fall apart as the troubles you will encounter will build up and ultimately kill the relationship. 

3) Attraction. While personality is important, if you aren't attracted to her then you will have issues later on. Part of attraction comes from personality too, and if you don't like her personality, you're screwed.

As for communication, when it is your turn to talk, use ""I feel..."" sentences. Don't make them accusatory. ""When you did X, it seemed like your intention was to Y, but I felt Z"" usually works. The Y part forces you to think about their side of things. 

**TL;DR - Read it.**
**Failing that, the golden rule is ""TALK TO HER, SHE KNOWS HOW SHE FEELS"" **

That's all I can come up with, leave suggestions for improvement and I shall have a look to fix it.

I started at a new school. On my first day, I was nervous as fuck. It was a much more bigger school than my old school. By lunchtime, I hadn't made a single friend to eat lunch it. In the corner of my eye, I see this kid wave at me and say ""Hey! You need a place to sit. Come sit with me and my friends"". I said ok. That seat became my seat and those guys became my friends. Because of that kid, I made friends and met people more than I would have if I did if he hadn't talked to me. 

Today I found out he killed himself. He was one of the most happiest people I've ever met. I sat next to him in Algebra and Pre-Calc. I ate lunch with him. This kid made things easier for me. I high fived him in the hallway. I hugged him countless of times. I played League of Legends with him and now he's gone. I know he had problems with school because he couldn't pass some of his classes but I didn't know it would come to this.

I don't know why but I keep hearing his voice in my head. I can hear him fucking laughing. I don't know what to think or say or do. I just hear his voice. I'm going for a drive. ",,False,self,t5_2rjli,False,,,True,t3_1j0228,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1j0228/this_is_surreal/,

1369760766.0,308,self.teenagers,1f7j1t,Guide: How To Get a Job,That_British_Kid,361,53,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1f7j1t/guide_how_to_get_a_job/,"**Edit: CV = Resume, to you uncouth ruffians across the Atlantic!**

So, I've seen way too many of these posts and they're kind of annoying me a bit. I know each person has a different situation yadda yadda but I can sum up 99% of cases on how to get a job here...

**What you need:**

* Perseverance and determination - A job won't come on a plate. You have to go out there and get one yourself
* A quality CV - This basically makes or breaks whether you get an interview
* A genuine desire to work - If you don't want to be there, they will be able to tell, and they won't hire you

Ok, so let's start from the beginning. 

Before you even start writing your CV or anything, you need to know what kind of jobs you can and want to do. Not everyone is able/suited to certain things, so I've compiled a list of certain jobs that teenagers generally do:

**For under 14 year olds**

* Dog walking
* Car washing
* Baby sitting (potentially, depending on the laws in your area)
* Lawn mowing/general gardening/household work
* Paper round

**14-15 year olds**

* All of above
* Tutoring
* Dish-washing at family-owned restaurants

**16+**

* All of above
* Retail - Shop assistant etc.
* Restaurants - Fast food employee, waiter/waitress, cafe employee, barista etc.
* Sports coach
* Hotel maid/bell boy
* Music teacher

I've probably missed a few but that's a pretty standard list.

**Your CV**

Your CV is what you hand to your potential employer with any application form/letter of interest. It details your education thus far, experience in employment and your skills/hobbies. 

Pro tips:

* Make it relevant. Applying to McDonalds? It's fine to put down the fact you're JV football captain, but what does it say about you? You're determined, work hard, a team player. 
* To further that, elaborate. Explain some of the things in your CV, don't just assume your employer will know what it all is and what it means.
* Use proper formatting, make it neat, presentable and unique. Google ""CV formats"", try some out, see what you like. Change the colours, font, and whatever. Make it yours.
* Include all the key details they need (Name, phone number, address, **references**.)
* References - Even if it's just your mom's friend who you baby sat for once, get someone who isn't related to you who would be willing (so, ask them first) to just give a good representation of you if the employer were to call them. Preferably 2 or 3.
* Keep it concise. If it's not relevant and you can't see how it is, then leave it out. Try and keep it to a maximum of 2 pages. They don't want to be reading an essay, just a quick idea of who you are and what you're about.

*Specific stuff to include*

* Contact details
* Education details - School, GPA/GCSE or A level grades &amp; predictions, classes taken and individual grades.
* Work experience
* Extra, **relevant** qualifications - Want to be a piano teacher? It tends to help if you've got grade 7/8 in piano.
* A small bio about yourself (personality, relevant attributes, aspirations).

After you've written it, it may be worth getting someone (a parent or another adult close to you) to just read over it to make sure you've included everything, but also to make sure it's not too long and you're not over-exaggerating your own abilities.

**Applying**

So, you've decided where you want to apply, you've got your CV written and now you need to hand it in. The best way to do it is in person. It shows you've given up your own time to go in and hand it in personally. They can also make a first judgement on you - so look presentable. Don't go in to a smart restaurant in baggy jeans and a hoodie. If you can't do this, then email/send the application and CV in with a short note saying thank you for reading and you hope to hear from them soon. Make sure you've covered everything they need in your CV and any application forms they require. 

**The wait/rejection**

Once you've applied, it may take them a few weeks to respond. If they haven't replied after 14 days, it is reasonable that you contact them to ask if they have considered your application. Be polite, ask if they have had time to look over it. The chances are they haven't, as most employers will be kind enough to inform you that you have failed to get an interview, but if they have, and they have decided that you aren't what they want, don't be disheartened. Don't be rude, because you can always re-apply at a later date. Just continue onto the next application.

After the initial 14 days wait, wait another 7 days for a reply to call/message them again. A final call could be warranted after a month or so, but if they have not replied to you after that, chances are they don't want you. 

You should be applying to 2 or 3 places at once anyway, so that's fine. If not, get applying to the next place now!

**The interview**

Ok, you've finally got an interview. They liked your CV, they just need to hear it from you yourself, and why you want to work for them. Some companies will do phone interviews, others will sit you down in a back room or meeting room and talk to you face to face. It depends, but the approach is the same.

* Be calm - Chill, you've got this far. They *like* you. They just want to be sure you're the right person for the job. 
* Be honest - Seriously. Don't lie. If they ask you about criminal convictions or something, and you have one, tell them. And don't try and justify it, because that makes you sound like you haven't learned.
* Don't prepare answers word perfectly - It makes you sound robotic. Sure go over a few questions and answers in your head and have a rough idea of what you're going to say, but don't practice them like a speech, it is obvious when you do this, and it's quite off-putting, even if it does show you want to do a perfect interview.
* Be enthusiastic - SMILE. Sound interested, ask questions too! If you're not sure about the role you'll be doing, ask. The interview will be happy that you're not just nodding and going ""yes sir"". They're human too. 
* For a some more tips, click [here](http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/interviews/a/aceinterview.htmhttp://jobsearch.about.com/cs/interviews/a/aceinterview.htm). (Although ignore the one about perfecting answers, again, it makes you sound robotic and overly-rehearsed). 

Typically the interview will give you a rough idea of when they'll get back to you - and they nearly all do, even if you're rejected at this stage. If they give you a time span of say a week, and it's been almost 2, then by all means contact them to inquire about where you stand. But don't do it as soon as the clock strikes midnight the day after they were supposed to call, people do forget, or run out of time.

Again, if you're rejected at this stage, don't fret. You can always apply again, and there's plenty of other places to apply to as well.


**Not getting fired**

Woo! You got the job, you're finally earning your own money. Now, dear god you don't want to get fired, right? Well, it's quite simple...

* Follow the rules. If the boss says no texting at work...don't text. Duh.
* Always give your all - This has saved me. I've broken and bent some rules at work, and have been in a lot of trouble, but my boss acknowledged that I do work hard and gave me a second chance because of it. If you're lazy, they'll have no qualms about firing you. 
* Don't ask for raises. You'll get one in good time, if you work hard. Although there is an exception to this rule...
* Know your rights. If you're being underpaid - tell your boss. Confront them. If you feel you're being harassed by a co-worker, tell the boss. If it's the boss, go to his superior. And so on. Don't just sit down and take it, because you'll be miserable, and it will reflect in your work. 

If you persist and genuinely want a job, you will find one. There are always people looking to hire, you just have to find them. You won't always be what they want, and they won't always be what you want, but you'll find something. 



**Extras**

* Know your obligations - If you need to pay tax or report to certain authorities or whatever, be aware of this. Fill out the tax forms and whatever. Chances are you won't be paid enough, but be sure to check. Your employer should know, but ask your parents as well as it may change something in their health insurance plan (I have no idea if that's possible, yay for the NHS).
* Read the contract before signing it. If you get given a lengthy contract to read and sign, ask for some time to go over it. Don't feel pressured into signing something before you've fully read it and understood it. Ask questions if necessary.
__________________________________________________________

The CV/Interview etc. parts are for the more formal jobs - retail/dining etc. 

If you're looking for a job as a babysitter or something more casual, then create fliers - similar to CVs although focusing far more on your skills specific to the job, and experience - and hand them out. Get your parents to inform their friends you're looking to do whatever and try and spread the word. Unless of course your client asks for a CV, in which case you provide one.

If the worst comes to the worst, just ask your parents if their friends or your neighbours have any thing they'd be willing to pay you $5/hour to do, like raking leaves or something. 

**Tl;dr: If you want a job, read it.**

In particular, these were two individuals H (guy) and D (girl).

Anyways, I was with my girlfriend, and we were about to have our first time, and I only had one condom. Anyways, we were just playing around at first before we got into it, but then all of a sudden everybody starts freaking out because H and D are about to have sex in the bathroom (They were both virgins, and weren't going out beforehand). 

Because they were out of control, and we didn't need 16 and pregnant coming to our school, I had to give the condom to them.

By the time this fiasco was over, we couldn't find another condom, and nothing happened, and my girlfriend had to leave.

Did I do the right thing? Or should I of just told them to screw themselves?

I stumbled across this subreddit by accident and decided to browse a little bit.  After reading your posts for quite awhile, I felt the need to send a message to all of you.  Everything I'm about to tell you is basically what I, as a 23 year old, now wish somebody told me when I was a teenager.

* Nearly everything you are stressed out about now will not matter what-so-ever when you leave high school.  You're probably not going to marry your high school crush that you pined over kissing for years, and I guarantee you will have a lot of experience with dating and sex in your future.  So chill out.  There's no need to worry about your romantic future when it most likely won't even be with somebody you know right now anyways.
* You will eventually lose all your friends that you thought you were close to.  Yes, there are some rare situations where a group of friends remain close to each other for 30+ years.  However, this most likely will not happen to you.  You all will go to different colleges, move to different parts of the state or even the country, and you will eventually drift apart.  But no worries - you will make new friends.  In college you will probably meet the best friends of your life.
* For the love of god, do not fuck up your life trying to be ""cool"".  This includes drinking, smoking, failing your classes, drunk driving, driving recklessly, etc. I'm sure there are a million other things that I can't think of.  Basically, you will most likely pay for these things for the rest of your life.  When you look back at the dumb shit you've done, it won't be worth it.  My personal example: I started smoking when I was 16 to get a boy to like me.  Now, at 23, we never dated.  We don't even talk anymore. I'm now on medication to help me quit smoking. 7 years of smoking...for what? Nothing.

I hope you all realize that I'm not saying this to be mean or judgmental towards any of you. I understand what it's like to be a teenager and I remember being at this point in my life. This is just my personal advice.

TL;DR: Everything you think matters right now doesn't matter at all. And don't fuck up your life with drugs or by being stupid.",,False,self,t5_2rjli,1353909199.0,,,True,t3_13ssj7,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/13ssj7/a_message_from_a_20something_year_old_to/,

So, /r/teenagers, I will try to make this worth your time.

---

**Things I Wish I Had Known as a Teenager**


**#1: Things get better.** I know you've all heard this a thousand times -- and I did too -- but it didn't actually hit me until I added this onto it: Even if they don't. ""Things get better, even if they don't,"" meaning that even if you don't get what you want and there is no happy ending, you learn how to deal with that, which makes you that much stronger and makes it hurt that much less. 

**#2: Relationships.** You'll have many of them, and that's a healthy thing. And when one ends and it feels like the end of the world, refer to #1. I've had many relationships blow up in my face, mostly serious ones that lasted years. It hurts. Every. Damn. Time. But every time, I learn something from it (generally what I'm looking for in a relationship and NOT looking for). 

And if you're in a relationship but feel unhappy? Don't be afraid to end it. Follow your gut instincts. It'll hurt at first, trust me, but you'll grow from it and become braver and stronger. This is important. So, so, so important. 

Not big on relationships? That is okay too and gives you time to focus on yourself and become an independent person, which is something that will be massively important in your adult life.

And a last one for the ladies here, because I'm one too and I've done this dumbass shit -- don't EVER, EVER waste your time on an asshole you think you can change or fix. People will ONLY change if they want to change, otherwise they'll drain you of your spirit and your happiness. And if he abuses you or hurts you or picks fights with you, leave him. Don't for a SECOND think you won't find better or that is the best you can get. 

**#3: Stand up for yourself.** Fight for you, love you. This was something I didn't learn until my 20s. I spent so many years trying to please other people -- whether by having a relationship with them or staying in a relationship I wasn't happy in or getting walked all over by rude family members, et cetra, et cetra. -- and at the end, I always got stuck holding the short end of the stick. A good motto that a friend told me once was, ""If 'I want...' isn't on the front end of your first reason for doing something, it isn't the right reason."" He was right.

**#4: Dreams.** Stick to them. Don't be afraid of dreaming big or small. Set goals. Work towards those goals, even if you think other people might think they're silly. For years, I told people I wanted to work in the video game industry. My family laughed at me and told me it was a silly hobby, but I kept volunteering, kept working my ass off, and at 21, I made my dream a reality. 

**#5: Acne.** Stop worrying about it, staring at it in mirrors, and picking at it. Most people don't see your acne, they see YOU. Find support at forums online, such as acne.org, and become educated on triggers and actual solutions. And don't worry -- most of it balances out in your 20s.

**#6: Depression sucks and is a very real thing.** I know many of you know this and hell, I know this. I've struggled with depression all of my life until I wound up on a low dose of anti-depressants. However, the best medicine can't come from a pill. It comes from within yourself and within your family and friends and/or people who support you. Hold onto these people and hold onto yourself and never let go of your inner light. And if your inner light goes out -- as it will do at some point in your life -- you must build yourself a new light, a new purpose, and keep going. Again, see #1. 

**#7: There's a lot of bullshit out there.** Shit, I don't have to tell you this, you're a Redditor, but really... there's so much shit out there. But trust me, there's a lot of good out there, too. 

**#8: Sex.** If you have it, be sure it is with someone you trust, someone you're comfortable communicating your concerns or fears with, someone who is precious to you. And be safe! This is the most important of all. If you are thinking of having sex, please don't be ashamed or afraid to stop into a Planned Parenthood or discuss birth control with a doctor. It's more important that you're safe than ""cool,"" because having an STD or unwantingly being pregnant is NOT cool and it's one of the worst, sinking feelings.

And if you don't have it, that is FINE. I didn't lose it 'til I was 21 because no one ""felt"" right to me. I was mocked and I watched my friends all talking about it, but I held out until it was right for me, until I would have no regrets or second-thoughts. It was worth it.

**#9: Drugs and drinking.** This is YOUR choice. However, please be conscious of long-term effects on your health and be smart about your choices! You don't want to be experiencing side-effects in your 40s of binge drinking in your teens and 20s. 

**#10: Don't be so afraid all the time.** I spent so much time worrying and afraid of taking chances in my teens. If you feel like there's something you REALLY want to try or REALLY want to do -- from school activities to a martial arts class to talking to that girl in school -- DO IT. Even if you're scared as hell, DO IT. It's empowering. It'll make you braver and more confident. And what do you have to lose? If it goes well, you can only gain from it. If it goes poorly, you can learn from it and do better the next time. 

And when you get to college? Take classes that ACTUALLY appeal to you. Not the shit people force-feed you -- ""You need a business degree to get a job."" Fuck that. Take classes on photography or literature or science or whatever appeals to you. This is the surest way to FIND what you want to do. It cannot be forced. And if you don't want to go to college? Don't until you do. I didn't go to school until my 20s because I didn't have a single damn clue WHAT I wanted to do. When I found it, I went to school for a degree. 

And a last note here about peer pressure and worrying about social standards and norms -- stop worrying about it. Most people in high school aren't people you will be around your entire life. Hell, most people are struggling with the SAME shit you are, RIGHT NOW. They might look cool and/or be top of their class, but I can guarantee you that they worry about relationships, sex, college, what they want to do, what their parents want them to do, et cetra. And most importantly? These people aren't you. They don't have to go to sleep at night with YOUR worries and YOUR regrets. Do what makes YOU happy, fuck other people. As I once read: ""Your life is yours, so stand up and live it!""

Best of luck out there.

They invited about 20 new mods, mostly from troll sub-reddits that surround this one, or sub-reddits such as /r/freeteens that disagree with us explicitly.

We caught it relatively quickly, but before we saw what was going on entirely, they managed to delete the sidebar, all custom CSS, all custom images, about 200 posts from the front page, cleared out spam filter by allowing a load of content, posted hate across the forum and basically turned it into a shitfest in a very short amount of time.

We put into private mode and went full on mod-mode.

We now have a Skype chatroom, which we are using to great effect, and which has sped up the process of working together somewhat, and which several of us intend to carry on using.

Whilst it may have been disruptive for a couple of hours, we are going to take several lessons from this as to how to prevent it and as to how to speed things up.

We're reusing hintssbot as a means to manage the community a little better, and we're making back-ups of all our data in somewhere a little more secure than a chest in my backyard, surrounded by pandas.

The custom CSS will be back shortly

Lets just get on with it.

Hi guys, 

I've put together a survey for /r/teenagers regarding sex and sex education because I'm studying to be a peer sex educator and I'm really interested in knowing how much sex education everyone has gotten and how that has affected the way that you do or don't have sex. I'm also looking into how religiousness affects sexuality. Don't worry, it's all confidential obviously.

I'd love if you could help me out and do it, it should take you about 10 minutes. 

Also if you can upvote this for visibility that would be great :) remember no karma for self posts.

Leave a comment if there's any mistakes or you think of a question I missed as well.
