[Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1503uf/broadening_my_narrow_antigun_view/)

Some people expressed an interest in reading about a member of gunnit taking me out shooting for the first time.  

[Inspectormac](http://www.reddit.com/u/inspectormac) offered to take me shooting and give me some experience handling various guns, and I agreed without a whole lot of thought.  It seemed like a good learning experience and something that would give me some real facts to work with instead of my mostly preconceived notions.  After telling my girlfriend what I was doing, she asked me what I knew about the guy who offered to take me shooting.

Well not much, really, let’s check out his comment history.  Okay, this guy likes guns.  **Really** likes guns.  In fact I don’t think there are any posts in here not in /r/guns.  Inspectormac offered to meet in the middle of where we live and drive down to the range since it was further from my place, I declined, but not because I was afraid he was going to shoot me.  Well, mostly not for that reason.

He took me to a range with several different sub-ranges for different types of shooting.  When I arrived, he was graciously slow explaining the process we would be going through and letting me know that if any point I was uncomfortable, we could stop.  I wasn’t overly apprehensive, but it was still a relief to know.  We also went over the four safety rules from the sidebar that he asked me to know before arriving.

After stepping into the range itself, the first thing that really struck me was how casual everyone was.  There were guys there with their Saturday morning cups of coffee, parents with their children, what looked like a guy teaching his girlfriend how to shoot, two older guys smiling and swapping stories.  The crowd looked more like they were going for a relaxing day of fishing than firing guns, but it helped drive home that this is a hobby like any other.   

After an intro into basic gun handling and mechanics and setting up our target, I got to shooting.  I started off with a Remington 597 .22lr rifle and quickly found that it wasn’t unlike shooting a BB gun, minimal kick, no distracting firing noise, and generally pretty entertaining to try and hit a target with.  This was followed up with two handguns, a Ruger SP-101 .22lr revolver, and a Ruger MK2 Target .22lr semi-automatic pistol.  While they had a somewhat threatening look to them, both were very easy to shoot and entertaining to work with as well.  I found I didn’t have to be distracted with worrying about recoil and got to focus on aiming.

This changed as we got to the bigger guns.  The first gun I shot that was really in the size and shape that I was expecting was a CZ-75b 9mm pistol.  This is the kind of gun I imagine everyone carrying with them on a daily basis and what I had the most interest in getting some exposure to.  The gun was heavier than I expected, and definitely packed the kickback I was expecting.  One thing Inspectormac did that really helped me ease into learning to shoot the guns was to let me fire each with only 1 round in it, so even if my irrational fear of dropping a gun from the recoil came true, nothing bad could come of it.

The main thing that struck me when shooting the CZ-75b was that hitting a the target where I wanted it was *hard*.  When Inspectormac placed the target at the first berm (10 yds, I believe) it seemed laughably close.  But after firing a few rounds, especially out of a 9mm, my aim was not so impressive.  Besides being humorous, it did really illustrate Inspectormac’s point that they are for self-defense, and in most self-defense scenarios your target will be in the 3-10 yd range.  If they’re not, they’re probably not a major threat.

I went on to shoot a Ruger Security 6, .357 magnum revolver, a 1911 A1, and a Springfield Armory XD9, 9mm striker fired pistol (Inspectormac’s carry gun which he graciously retrieved from his car for me to shoot).  The revolver was interesting, but like the CZ-75b, I spent so much time focusing on my grip, preparing for the recoil, and the number of shots that I had fired, that I didn’t get much of a chance to enjoy the shooting process.  The 1911 A1 was actually incredibly fun to shoot and learn the history behind and was probably the most entertaining thing I shot all day.  Lastly, the XD9 was shockingly light compared to the CZ-75b, which makes sense for a gun that you would carry around with you all day.

Throughout the day we discussed various topics, from the variety within the sport (practical, longarms), to ammunition and history of the guns, mechanical (double action, single action, firing pin, etc) and a little bit of the political side of the issue.  I got to walk around and see the different types of ranges and activities that go on there as well.

I would call the day a definite success.  First and foremost (for me) I don’t hold an irrational fear of a gun being dropped and misfiring.  All the weapons I shot took conscious, focused pressure to discharge.  This may sound like a no-brainer to most of you, but it was hands down my #1 fear about guns.  Inspectormac’s carry gun even had an extra trigger within the main trigger that had to be depressed for it to fire.   In addition, while I did find the recoil on the larger guns substantial, I never felt like I was going to lose my hold on them.

The next important thing that set in was that hitting anything beyond 10 yards is somewhat difficult, and that they are indeed designed by-and-large designed for close quarter self-defense.  I also feel that if a gun were to somehow find itself into my hands or in my presence, I would at least know how to handle it safely and not injure myself or anyone around me.

One thing that struck me in talked to Inspectormac was that while walking around with his carry-gun, I would never see him on the street and know that he had a gun.  Especially in Arizona, I’m sure that I walk past people concealed carrying several times a day without any incidents.

The last really important thing I learned was what ""semi-automatic"" actually means.  It's a lot harder to get caught up in the fervor of *banning semi-automatic weapons* when you actually know what it means.

In short, I would not hesitate to go shooting again (especially a 1911-A1), but I don’t know as if I would go so far as to own a gun.  The primary shift in view has come in the form of now viewing the second amendment with similar gravity as I view the first amendment, whereas before I thought it was outdated.  

Thanks again to Inspectormac for taking me out, paying for everything, and giving up his Saturday of shooting (seriously, he focused 100% on helping me, didn’t shoot at all) to educate me.  He is a great ambassador for your hobby (he even got me to say magazine instead of clip!).  And thanks to all the members of gunnit who offered advice, opinions, and recommendations in my original thread.

Just to be there.

School says kids' anxiety went down and kids said they felt safer with the dads there.

Since, more dads have volunteered to come to the school. Help in out in the library, eat lunch with the kids, extra playground monitors, door watching to make sure the doors are locked from the outside that should be, stuff like that.

So now we have a program officially in place where dads can sign up for shifts and positions in the school on their days off and stuff. the school says that since this has started, bullying is non existent, no one's getting hurt on the playground either. At the Jr. High, no one's fighting in the halls, and when they sit with the kids that sit alone at lunch, other kids come and sit and the quiet kids are now participating in class way more.

Fathers, involved with their school having a very surprising and measurable effect there. Shocking. 

Utah has allowed teachers to carry without notifying the principal, principals don't care. Same policy with the dads. ",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1359702699.0,,,True,t3_17oabr,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/17oabr/so_at_my_kids_school_some_dads_have_made_a_huge/,
1350371231.0,2307,self.guns,11k68p,The best thing I have ever read pertaining to concealed carry. This should be a required read for anyone wanting to carry concealed.,sh3llsh0ck,3198,891,706,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/11k68p/the_best_thing_i_have_ever_read_pertaining_to/,"Disclaimer: I'm sure this is a cross-post from somewhere, but it's worth it to read.

As a gun owner, you have to be cool-headed, more-so than the police ever have to be.
And you do not *ever* run around pretending to be the police while carrying a gun because then, shit like this can happen.
You do not start shit, act aggressively, flip the bird, roll your eyes, talk shit, or even raise your voice. *To anyone.* **Ever.**

A combat instructor (who happened to be Buddhist and a Marine) once said to me: ""From now on, when dealing with (ed.) crazy / possibly violent people, you will lose every argument. You are *always* wrong. You are sorry for impinging on their day. You will apologize and apologize again. You *will* back the fuck down. You *will* put your tail between your legs. You *will* let them talk shit about your ladyfriend. You *will* let them call your mother a bitch and a whore and your dad a bastard. You have no ego. ""
""You do all this because if you are the one to start a fight, by default that fight now has a gun in it, and if you start losing, you're going to pull it and kill him. And even if you don't go to jail because you could convince the jury that it was self-defense, you're going to have to live with the fact that you could have saved someone's life and yet you let your ego kill someone.""
""You are not the police, so don't act like them. Though all of you [civilians] are better shots than the police, you do not have the training, the continuum of force policy, or a union plus free lawyers protecting you if you screw up.""

ed: He also said: ""but after backing down and trying to apologize, if at any time you then feel your life or that of a loved one is in danger, put three rounds into his [cardiothoracic] vault, call the police, give a statement, go home, and sleep like a baby. You did all you could for your attacker, and he was the one that made the final decision...

... to kill himself.""

Cross-post aside; make sure you take the responsibility of carrying a weapon seriously. All of our rights depend on it. DO NOT give chances to people when your life is in danger, but DO NOT let your ego, or your pride kill someone.

Edit: returned post to original content.

Edit 2: People have been adding that you shouldn't talk to the police up front, but should in fact get a lawyer. I have to agree with this recommendation. Don't let your adrenaline make you do silly things. Keep your head level, and lawyer up (while remaining respectful to LE personnel).",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1350404747.0,,,True,t3_11k68p,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/11k68p/the_best_thing_i_have_ever_read_pertaining_to/,

**What We Did:**
We did a variety of realistic exercises, including:

* Hostage situations
* Clearing a building with multiple active shooters
* Traffic stops

The volunteers from our marksmanship club were the bad guys, and the police were the good guys. To keep it as realistic as possible, we were all armed with Simunition Glock 17s. They're exactly like a real Glock 17 (to the point where I'm sure you could switch the slide assembly with a real Glock and be good to go), except that they shoot marking pellets and won't chamber real ammunition. Shooting Simunition feels like shooting a 22. There's very little recoil. It's loud enough to where it gets your attention even though no hearing protection is needed (unlike a 22, where you should still wear hearing protection). Imagine a large man with big hands clapping his hands together about two feet from your face. I found a pretty good video of Simunition here (skip to 3:15 if you just want to see it shot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C2lwo-VjPE

So without further ado, let me share what I learned:


**1. COPS DON'T KNOW THE LAW.**

Almost every time we did a traffic stop, the cop would immediately notice the gun in the center of the floor, confiscate it, unload it, run the serial number, and ask us if it was registered. They even arrested one of us for simply having it. In my state there is no gun registration, and it's perfectly legal for anyone to have a loaded gun in his car without a permit. Seizing the gun and running the serial is improper unless there is probable cause to believe it's illegal or stolen, et cetera. We didn't get the chance to explain any of this, because the cops became extremely aggressive and on-edge the moment they knew we were armed.

*Take-home point:* Know the law, because the cops probably won't. If a cop tries to do something unwarranted or illegal, feel free to CALMLY make it known that you don't consent to what they're doing, but let them go on doing it. Your lawyer can sort out an illegal search and seizure later, but a resisting-arrest charge is harder to deal with. 

**2. SHOOTING UNDER STRESS IS NOTHING LIKE RANGE SHOOTING**

Simunition *hurts.* It will make you bleed if it hits you in the right spot, and it always leaves an angry welt. With the possibility of the pain and the realism of the scenarios, I was about as stressed as I could be without being in a truly life-or-death situation. Here's what I noticed:

* Your hands will shake like mad. My front sight was bobbling far more than normal. When I went to change magazines, I could hardly grab the darn things or feed them into the gun because my hands were shaking so much. I am not a sweaty guy, but I had to wipe my hands at one point because I was losing my grip on the gun. It took me a good thirty seconds to fumble my fingers into my pockets to grab a magazine (I didn't have a mag pouch).
* You probably won't see your sights. During one traffic stop, my passenger and I were pulled out of the vehicle. My passenger was searched, but I was not, and my gun was pretty well concealed at 4 o'clock in my IWB holster (Crossbreed Supertuck Deluxe). Ten feet to my left, an officer is going through the passenger's pockets and has just spun around to where he can't see me. Ten feet in front of me is an officer who's facing my direction but is distracted, reading the details of my fake driver's license into his radio. I've been told to start shooting if I see an opportunity, and I see it. Time slows down, I agonize for what seems like a minute but what is actually two or three seconds over whether I'm going to do it. Then I do it, there's no looking back, I step to the side, lift my shirt, pull my gun, and fire five times before I can process what I've done. I'm sidestepping quickly, firing, keeping my isoceles, and only on my 11th and final shot is there a pause in the action and I remember that my gun has helpful little posts on the front and back. Cease-fire is called. I wasn't shot and I had hit the cop in front of me five or six times through purely instinctive aiming.
* Moving helps. Those who moved, as I did in the scenario above, didn't get shot. Those who camped in corners of the building or otherwise stayed stationary, did. 
* Capacity matters. When my hands were shaking and I had tunnel vision and I was confronted with an opponent, my accuracy wasn't great and my opponents weren't going to fall over if I just grazed them in the arm. My first instinct was to keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting until I couldn't shoot any more. I remember reading that when multiple police officers fire at one suspect they use something like 5 times more rounds per officer than one officer does shooting alone at one suspect. The sound coming from their fellow officer's guns freaks them out even more, they can't process it in the heat of the moment, they don't know what's going on, they just shoot and shoot until the threat is ended. That's pretty much how I felt.

*Take-home point:* If you think standing at the range and shooting at a stationary paper target is going to prepare you to defend yourself, you're dead wrong. I love going to the range, I love being intimately familiar with my guns, but that alone will not help you survive a self-defense scenario. I'm no great fan of James Yeager, but he did say something that now strikes me as very true: In a stressful situation, you won't default to your highest level of training, you'll default to whatever level you've totally mastered as muscle memory. Participate in exercises like this if you can, take courses that teach defensive shooting and put you in actually stressful scenarios.

**3. COPS DON'T SHOOT WELL.**

As I mentioned before, stressful shooting is nothing like range shooting. Unfortunately, it seems like too many officers are shooting their 50-round annual qualifications and not much else. Realistic shooting scenarios are even more infrequent than range time. This isn't just anecdotal - one of the officers supervising the training told me as much. Our marksmanship club members were obviously performing far better than the police - in some cases we were running a kill-to-death ratio of up to 5. 

*Take-home point:* Support your local police force. Volunteer for events like this. If they are spending their budget responsibly but still don't have the money to train their officers properly, consider donating whatever resources you can or voting in local elections for more funding.

Carrying a gun does not make you a righteous bastion of moral purity. It does not make you badder, harder, bigger and stronger than the others around you. It does not grant you authority. It provides its user with a means to equalize a potential disparity in lethal force, and morally, that's all it does. 

The gun is not a license to go to dangerous places, do dangerous things, or create dangerous situations, just because you might have a better chance to survive them. You should still use caution and maintain situational awareness to avoid violence. You should back down from the swaggering bravado of other men and act more timidly and kindly than your caveman instincts would normally encourage you to. Rather than carrying a gun through the bad part of town at 3am, it's better to structure your day so that a trip through the bad part of town at 3am is not on the agenda. 

Zimmerman was legally justified to shoot Martin at the moment he took the shot, as was just proven in a court of law. But Zimmerman, Martin, and society as a whole would've been better served if Zimmerman had not followed Martin, or at least had not followed Martin as long as he did. 

Now, we'd have been equally well-served if Martin had reached his father's residence and simply stayed inside rather than swaggering out to confront the much smaller man who'd trailed him home. Martin acted just as Zimmerman did and just as we should not: he assumed that because he possessed superior access to lethal force, he could ignore social decorum and safety and march into what would otherwise be a dangerous situation. And regardless of what happened between the end of the phone call and the end of the altercation, he paid for his masculine pride with his life. 

If you're going to carry a gun, be educated, trained, and practiced. Carry safely in a holster. Carry jacketed hollow point ammunition. And do *not* treat the gun as a license to be stupid. Carrying a gun means the opposite: it means you have a duty to be cautious and to be smart.",MOD APPROVED,False,,t5_2qhc8,1373843647.0,,,True,t3_1iabke,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1iabke/the_judicious_use_of_selfdefense_in_light_of_the/,

You're special and unique and your mommy loves you very much and if you just applied yourself I'm sure you'd go real far (as if that's somehow a compliment). But guns are guns and your performance is pretty well independent of the platform you're using, barring extreme differences in quality or your five insurmountable minutes of familiarity with Paw Paw's 1911. 

So these are the guns you should buy, *and the order in which you should buy them*. 

(Yeah, I know, general readership; you bought a Mosin first and you learned super good and now you and your sandbags and your concrete table can always hit the clay pigeons you set on the ground at a distance that's actually 73 yards, but what the hell, call it 100 for the internet. I'm not writing for you, and newbie here should make purchases he'll use to learn things instead of following in your illustrious footsteps.)

**FIRST GUN:** First we're going to put on our big boy pants and go to the local Wal-Mart and get us a Ruger 10/22. There's nothing wrong with most other .22 rifles, sure. Your grandpa wanted you to learn on a bolt action so you'd ""take your time and value each shot."" Your grandpa has no idea what he's talking about. 10/22. [Tech sights](http://tech-sights.com). USGI sling. [Appleseed](http://appleseedinfo.org). No more fucking questions until you do that. Also, Wal-Mart is peopled by dispassionate wage slaves who won't try to upsell you to some other bullshit you neither want nor need. If you go to a gun store, you're gonna walk out with some random WASR or something, because you're too dumb to do your research beforehand and are asking strangers of unknown wisdom on the internet what to buy. 

You're all Appleseeded up and you're super cool and now you want a

**HANDGUN:** Glock 19. No. I don't care that the M&amp;P fits your hand better or that the SR9 is cheaper. Shut the fuck up. You're asking vapid entry-level questions on the internet. Get the Glock. Not a 1911, not my beloved CZ-75, not a SIG, not an overpriced goddamn HK that's gonna turn you into Tom Cruise from Collateral. Glock 19.

The communist zombie 1% martian UN muslim Obama Axe body spray troops are invading and you need a

**RIFLE:** [Spike's Tactical](http://www.spikestactical.com/new/z/st15-16-midlength-le-carbine-p-443.html) AR-15. Play fucking legos with it. Go nuts. Throw red dots and lasers and a vertical goddamn frontpenis on there. It'll make you tacticooler and you wouldn't listen to my real advice (which is to leave it bone-stock and add accessories as necessary to address real shortcomings you experience on the range rather than perceived problems invented by marketers) anyway.

Yeah, but for home defense you want to make badguy shit his pants in the universal language and so you need a

**SHOTGUN:** [Mossberg 590](http://www.mossberg.com/product/shotguns-pump-action-590-special-purpose-special-purpose-9-shot/50645). Mossberg 500s are fine but those listed on their web site are either all tacticool or designed for Elmer Fudd to shoot gooses and shit. God damn. Just spend some reasonable fucking money on a black-furniture-having shotgun that's short enough for your hallway, dipshit. Oh, and if there's a pistol grip on there, I will laugh at you as soon as you leave.

Now take some blurry pictures of your special and exciting new ""family,"" because I care a whole goddamn lot about your ego investment purchases and wish to validate you as a human being via that little orange arrow and I think it's just *darling* when you refer to guns as if they're people.

There was a reporter on campus interviewing a large group of girls with the general reaction of ""omg scary bla bla bla"". So I decided to step up and offer an alternative opinion to the situation. 

I told the reporter that while the incident had been unfortunate and it was extremely fortunate that the police had been able to apprehend the person in question, that the current state of a disarmed campus is obviously not working. This man walked into a gun free zone with a weapon, and didn't stop. I also mentioned that campuses are often targeted because there is a large population who are disarmed because they are law abiding citizens. 

I also brought up the fact that should an incident like this happen, having even one person in a room where people were being attacked who was a CCW holder, that the incident could be stopped much sooner. I mentioned that many people have stereotypes and fear guns without realizing that they are simply tools, and nothing more. They are as dangerous as the people who own them. If you follow the 4 rules and are a responsible gun owner, then you should have the right to protect yourself and the people around you from someone intent on taking the lives of innocent people. 

I'll be writing a letter to the chancellor of the university, and also to the police chief that explains my views on the current gun free policy. I will post the letter here before I send it to get everyone's opinions. 

EDIT:

Update. 

As predicted, my interview didn't appear in any news sources that I was able to find. 

My dad recommended that instead of a letter we do a petition, but I don't really know how I would get news of a petition to the student body. From what I've seen the reaction time that everyone is applauding for the police is somewhere between 10 and 15 min, which is far too late for my comfort.

**EDIT 2: Thanks for someone, probably from the sub in question, posting my information on a dox site on TOR, looking for more information on me.**

We are all aware that reddit is a community, and the gun community is part of that. As a gun owner, most of us know there are bad people in society, who look to cause you harm, and reddit is far from immune to these people. We expect a certain level of anonymity, the rules of the community support this, and as we know, people will break this rule.

reddit is a very ""liberal"" community, and with that brings a sect of anti-gun people. There are several anti-gun subs on reddit, which is great. Having those subs allows us to interact with people who don't share our same view point, and hopefully educate them in what this community is about. This kindness, goodwill, and education, can be seen be viewing the [second highest scoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/16ortk/followup_broadening_my_narrow_antigun_view/) post on /r/guns. Though, having only a few hundred subscribers between several subs, none of these legitimate anti-gun subs are popular. 

We do have anti-gun subs on reddit that have a small following. However, these subs are are not anti-gun, but anti-gunowner. **Well over 600 submissions** to /r/guns alone have be linked to their sub in an attempt to vote brigade, and direct others to the post to belittle, mock, and cause problems for the OP. Most of the people they target, are not frequent posters to the gun subs, but want to share something with the community. Not only do they attempt to manipulate, and brigade votes, they will also make fun of, belittle, and mock the OP on their sub, because of their weight, gender, color, or location.

They post screen shots from different subs of anyone who brings up guns in a good light, and then will try to direct people to those comments, or posts, to do the same as they do with the pictures. 

They RES tag just about every one they can, who posts in any of the gun subs, and when they see you in another sub, they will downvote you, and comment on your post about you being a gun owner. 

They keep categorized list with hundreds of pro-gun posts that they don't like, and when they come upon these users, they will try to use those posts against them, sometimes in subs, or posts, that have nothing to do with guns.

Where it does get very personal, is when they dox us. Doxing means to post personal information (names, address, facebook, phone number, location, etc...) of another user, or anyone really. They have done this to several members of the community, for things such as posting a youtube video, to leading a fundraiser for our 2nd Amendment rights. 

Not only that, they have contacted news organizations (very scummy ones) to try to bring negative attention to our community.

It goes as far as them contacting, and ask everyone else to contact, local PD, state PD, the ATF, and FBI, to investigate legal gun owners, and proprietors on /r/guns, and reddit as a whole. They will lie to these agencies, and then slander the person in their sub.

The admins have been contacted over, and over, and they fail to do anything about it. They continue to let these mentally ill, rule breakers, take jabs at us. And, as gun owners, we are some of the most upstanding, and law abiding members of the community, and we will just keep our chins up.

The reddit community is supposed to be a safe community. And as many of us who carry guns know, it is not safe everywhere.

So please, be careful of what you post. Please, have permission of the person in a picture, or video, if it is not yourself. Please, do not even try to vaguely threaten, or try to argue with these people, as that is what they want. They want nothing more than to try to catch you fuck up. 

Be safe, stay sharp, bring OC.

TL;DR: reddit is not anonymous, people will use the fact that you are involved in guns in any way, and try to use it against you, to cause emotion, and elicit a response from you, causing a not so good/safe reddit experience. Please be safe, and be aware that this can happen to you.

1)      the lawsuit designed to strike down the bill the Governor signed into law last Tuesday unless he can show there was a true emergency to warrant the waiver of the 3-day rule, mandated by Article III, section 14 of the State Constitution, which reads,  “No bill shall be passed or become a law unless it shall have been printed and upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless the governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or her hand and the seal of the state, the facts which in his or her opinion necessitate an immediate vote thereon….” The bill has 56 sections; 53 take effect in 60 days, 2 take effect in one year and 1 section, which requires owners of certain firearms to register them within one year takes effect immediately. In other words, given the language of the bill itself, there is no emergency.  As the enforcers of the State Constitution we need to Petition the State Supreme Court to declare the SAFE ACT unconstitutional, null and void.

2)      The Petition that will be served on every member of the state legislature and the Governor instructing them to comply with Article XII of the State Constitution, which reads, “The defense and protection of the state and of the united states is an obligation of all persons in the state. The legislature shall provide for the discharge of this obligation and for the maintenance and regulation of an organized militia” and the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which reads, “A well-regulated militia is essential to the security of a free state ….” The Legislature has failed to provide for the discharge of the obligation of all persons in the state to defend the state and nation through an organized militia, well-armed, well-regulated, well-trained and well-disciplined, to which all able bodied men and women belong. As the enforcers of the State Constitution we need to Petition the Governor and every member of the State Legislature to act to begin to bring the state into compliance with the State and Federal Constitutions by restoring the state militia. 

 
I expect to send the documents with instructions within a day or so.
 
In Liberty,
 
Bob Schulz

This is a call to arms to all of those who would oppose the AWB that Sen Feinstein plans to introduce today. Today we take to the phones, twitter and email to inundate the offices of every congress and senate member in the US. 

We will reach every rep.

We will overwhelm them.

We will be victorious. 

Here are your resources

**Email**

(Courtesy of the fine people over at Ruger) - Clicking this link will bring you to a pre-typed letter that will be messaged to ALL of your reps. Send it two or three times a day until further notice.

http://www.ruger.com/micros/advocacy/takeAction.html

**Phone:**

The bill will first be introduced into the Senate and the Democratic Senate Majority leader has already been hard pressed to allow a vote on this issue. **Call him first and let him know your opinion: Harry Reid (D-NV) (202) 224-3542**

As /u/Deradius bravely put it,

&gt;Reid is paying close attention to what will happen in the Senate. If he doesn't think he can get 60 votes, he'll prevent a vote on any gun control legislation, so as to avoid Dems ending up with an anti-gun vote on their record.

**We also have a few swing seats that will be up for reelection soon and this issue could cause them to lose their seats. Let's let them know that.**

Senate Swing Votes Who Are Up For Re-election in 2014:

Max Baucus (D-MT) (202) 224-2651

Mark Begich (D-AK) (202) 224-3004

Susan M. Collins (R-ME) (202) 224-2523

Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) (202) 224-6342

Tim Johnson (D-SD) (202) 224-5842

Mary L. Landrieu (D-LA) (202) 224-5824

Mark L. Pryor (D-AR) (202) 224-2353

Mark Udall (D-CO) (202) 224-5941

Tom Udall (D-NM) (202) 224-6621

Mark R. Warner (D-VA) (202) 224-2023

After you have called those above you should call your representatives and tell them to OPPOSE the assault weapons band and to not compromise on any further gun legislation. 

**Find your CONGRESS members here** - http://www.house.gov/representatives/

**Find your SENATE members here** - http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

Take to twitter with the following hashtag #2ARights (graciously suggested by our brother in arms [Gone Skiing](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/171okg/daylong_twitterbomb_in_response_to_feinsteins_awb/) Post videos, opinions and articles and kill that hashtag.

When they get to a social-reach of ~24 million people, they will post the following statement through the Facebook and Twitter accounts of everyone who signed up:

""I support common-sense steps to reduce gun violence. #NowIsTheTime to act. Share this if you agree:""

I think we should come up with our own hashtag and message and set up a similar system. What do you think?

EDIT: Having a webpage where people can sign up to be part of a Twitter/Facebook bomb like the one at whitehouse.gov would be really nice. Any suggestions?

UPDATE: You can follow the #NowIsTheTime hashtag [here](http://trendsmap.com/topic/%23nowisthetime). Thanks to /u/Bartman383 for the link in the comments.

UPDATE: /u/Gunrightprotector has created www.nowisthetime.co and is waiting for approval of a Thunderclap-based Twitter-bomb. I have contacted the NRA-ILA, the Second Amendment Foundation, and Gun Owners of America, so hopefully I will hear back from them soon.

**#NowIsTheTime for Americans to tell Congress what they really think about ""common sense"" civilian disarmament.**

REQUEST: Does anyone have a Hashtags.org account and want to pull some of the expanded analysis of #NowIsTheTime for us?

I will say this, today my thoughts are with the injured and the families of the victims not the politics of the thing.

Among other things I expect we will be seeing more traffic from gun control advocates wanting to discuss these issues. I personally feel it's to early to discuss such things and its also unlikely to change the opinions of “us” or “them” I do think it provides a good stage for those who may not have made up their mind on these issues to see the debate and make a decision based on facts.

As such I would urge you as you have these discussions, to act with poise and respect, if for no other reason than this is a good opportunity to dispel the perceptions of “gun owners”.

I am sure some discussions will get heated (they already have) just try to remember we represent the gun owners of reddit and how we act will play a role in either solidifying or breaking stereotypes.

All that being said, I will not be removing posts or comments that are not in keeping with the general tenor of [1] /r/guns. Reporting a link or comment because you don’t agree with what someone says will not result in its removal.

I welcome comments on this.

Stay safe my friends.

I went to a VERY liberal graduate school.  I am not a drinker, but frequently went out to bars and clubs with my liberal grad student friends who were.  When the subject of banning guns, gun control, etc., came up I would simply say this statement:

""You seem like a fair minded person.  You don't like guns.  I don't like alcohol.  If you can tell me one argument for banning guns that does not apply equally to banning alcohol, I'll throw all my guns in the river tonight.  Otherwise, we'll just have to both agree that it's a matter of personal choice and let each other be.""

Some of the usual attempts were: 

""Guns kill people.""  Response:  Alcohol kills more people.

""Yeah, but guns are used in crime.""  Response:  So is alcohol.  Aside from the obvious drunk driving and addiction related crimes, what % of people who commit crime do you think drunk?  Ask a cop how many domestic violence situations involve alcohol.  

""But guns are used in terrible murders.  Alcohol only causes accidents or health-related deaths.""  Response:  This is an even stronger argument for banning alcohol.  If you banned guns, at least some of those murders would still get committed.  If you banned alcohol, NONE of the alcohol related accidental deaths would happen.  (i.e. the definition of an accident is that its unintended, unlike murder).  

""They tried to ban booze and it didn't work.""  Response:  Try to ban guns in the USA.  You see what happens.  No country with hundreds of millions of firearms in circulation and porous borders has ever successfully banned guns (or anything for that matter: see war on drugs.)

""But drinking is fun and a social activity.""  Response: Let's go shooting on Saturday.  Empty a few mags from an AK-47 and then tell me it's not fun.

And so I took some of the more open-minded ones shooting.  They had a great time and several of them are now gun owners. 

Nobody has yet given me a reason to ban guns that didn't apply with equal or greater force to booze.  

**Edit:**  I probably should have called this an anti gun-ban argument rather than an anti gun-control argument.  I'm not trying to advocate any policy in the real world based on this. I was just trying to explain to people -- many of whom had never even met a pro-gun person -- how anti-gun views were more of a matter of opinion than of some cut and dried logic.

I got an email for a ""Community Committee Against Gun Violence Meeting"" in my area, so I thought I'd go and see if this was really about stopping violence, or stopping guns. (**TL;DR - they want your AR's, really.**) So I thought at the very least I could troll the group of 40 RSVP'd folks. Show up and there are 200 people packed into this church cafeteria. They talked for an hour about how to most effectively reach/influence your legislators, and everyone there *hand-wrote a letter* to a Colorado legislator. Many sad stories were told, and one of the Columbine victims' fathers was in attendance. Then there was a Q&amp;A, and a Registered Nurse (who treated one of the Aurora victims!) took the microphone to warn people about invading Patient Privacy. Then the only other person there under 50 spoke about Johns Hopkins research on mental health. 

I warned them as a medical student about the unintended consequence of driving people underground, away from patient care if they need it. I talked about Vets coming home from wars, worried that a diagnosis of PTSD will rob them of their rights and abilities. I mentioned that Columbine happened during the previous AWB. I told people to turn off the news and stop glamorizing these psychopaths as anti-heros with their faces and names plastered all over the news.  *(All of this to much nodding from the crowd)*  Wanted to tell them all to visit [AssaultWeapon.info](http://www.assaultweapon.info/), but I forgot!  Facepalm!

Their official goals, in order:  

* Reinstate stricter AWB &amp; mag caps  
* Background Checks for Private Sales  
* ""Something"" about Mental Health (yes, they know about the Judge adjudication thing)  
* [Assault Weapons Literature](http://imgur.com/zeriT)

Insider insight:

* They've wised up about the toxicity of the term ""Gun Control"" and have substituted the phrase ""Stopping Gun Violence."" 
*  The lady running the show knows the tricks: private sales, grandfathering. Eventually she revealed that she wants to ideally implement a system like Australia, with a massive buyback. She was very impressed with the Australians' violent crime data.
* Claims that the NRA is promulgating myths like ""More Deaths from Fists and Hammers"" (yes, I know that's the FBI crime data and *not* a myth).  So this argument doesn't work on them. 
* I asked the room how many had ever operated a firearm - **probably 70% had used a gun!** That surprised me. We always rail against the anti's as ""ignorant people who've probably never fired a gun"" but that's incorrect.  
* I asked the room how many have ever fired an AR-pattern rifle.  About 9 raised their hands (to audible gasps). 
* They are submitting bills to counter all the pro-gun progresses made, like the Colorado Supreme Court ruling that CCW must be allowed on CU campuses. [They don't like CCW.](http://imgur.com/Pe2Uc) They want to revise the Carry law to prohibit guns from K-12 all the way up to college level.  Please don't bother circlejerking about how silly ""gun-free zones"" are, I know.

The good/bad news:  

* We are fighting little old ladies and moms. Who have plenty of free time to hound legislators with letters and phone calls and meetings.  
* People honestly are afraid of ""black guns"" and scary components.  
* Our opposition knows they're splintered and terribly organized. The grabbers know they face a mighty foe with the NRA. 

Final thoughts: don't bother using facts. You must appeal to emotion.  And do be nice, if you can. Some people have been victims of violence, and you mustn't dismiss or belittle their suffering.

I've edited the original post a little bit, took out some fluff here and there. /u/MaverickTopGun tells me that /u/FirearmConcierge needs someone else to share some stories. And sorry for the length.

I did a post about this store called [You think you had a bad day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ejoer/you_think_you_had_a_bad_day/) Anyways, onto the stories!

**First Experiences**

Before starting working where I work now, I only had limited experience with guns, firearms, weapons, etc. I was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter. One of the people training me, laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed. These rules are:

* 1) The weapon is always loaded.
* 2) Even when you know the weapon is unloaded. It's always loaded.
* 3) Always point the weapon at a safe direction. Never at someone. See rules 1 and 2 for why.
* 4) When handing a weapon over to someone, make sure the slide/bolt is locked back and present the arms to them with the chamber so they can see that it's cleared.
* 5) When a weapon is handed to you, always clear it. See rules 1 and 2.
* 6) Never point a firearm at something that you don't intend to kill. There is no such thing as shooting to injure.
* 7) Finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at.

I also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon. People will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall. I would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules 1 and 2. Most people will drop sight line, raise the weapon's barrel to point at the ceiling, lower the weapon down, etc to let me pass. Cool, no problem.

My first day behind the gun counter, and the first customer I had behind there wanted to see a Glock 17. I remove the weapon from the case, clear it, locked the slide back, handed it to him and then he proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands. Problem? He was pointing it right at me. I moved to the side to get out of the line of ""fire"" and he followed me.

""Sir, could you please not point the weapon at me?""

""Why, it's not loaded?""

""I don't care, please don't point the weapon at me.""

""Stop being such a...""

At this point, a co-worker who's been there for 10+ years reaches out, grabs the slide from the top, breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave.

""Why do I have to leave?""

""Because you aren't being safe with the weapon. You need to leave now.""

""Fuck you. I want to see a manager.""

Fine. My coworker calls out a name. Down at the other end of the counter, is the president of the company. The name called was his. My coworker tells the president what just happened, including the ""fuck you"" part, the president looks at me asks if I did have a gun pointed at me. ""Yes sir."" Asked the customer if he did point the gun at me, ""Yeah, but it was unloaded."" The president looks at the guy and says matter of factly,""Get the fuck out of my store and don't come back.""

The guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it, saying that he shouldn't be talking to a customer that way, which was met with a reply of ""you stopped being a customer when you pointed a gun at one of my employees."" The guy wasn't moving and was getting more and more angry. Since we are cater to LEO and military, we usually have a sheriff, police officer, constable, state police, or a federal agent in store. The president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that there's five officers looking at him, ready to take him out of the store and to downtown/jail if he doesn't leave now.

Officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting. I never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerk's ass.

""Fine! I'm never coming here again!"" The customer said.

""I know and I don't care,"" the big boss said.

**Yes, we accept trades!**

So, we take trades. This guy comes in looking to trade his shotgun for credit to get a different shotgun. No biggie. We do this all the time. We tell him to bring in the weapon, and make sure it's cleared. He brings in the shotgun, and hands it to me. It felt... different. Heavier.

""Are you sure this is cleared?""

""Yeah, I cleared it before I put it in the car.""

I rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead. I follow the shell in flight, in slow motion as I see it hit him in the head, thinking ""What the fuck man!?""

I rack it six more times.

Six more shells go flying out.

He is told to put the shells back in his car and we'll finish the trade when he comes back in. He also got a stern talking too by one of the mangers.

**I need a holster**

We sell anything an officer needs; duty gear, pants, holsters, accessories for their weapons, badges, vehicle equipment, you name it, we have it or can get it. So a local officer comes in and needs a holster.

""We can help you with a holster. What weapon do you have?""

""I don't know.""

This happens more times than I feel comfortable with saying. If my sample size is any indication about other officers, a good 85-90% don't know what side arm they carry. We ask if he has it with him, he says yes, and we tell him to clear the weapon, lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holster.

He comes back in with a weapon, ""cleared."" We see that it's a common weapon, and we have different holsters for it and show him the holsters. As he is looking at the holster, someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon. He drops the slide, which chambers a round. The gun is now hot, live and ready to shoot. Someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster. The weapon is stuck.

Fuck us, a loaded gun is stuck in a holster. Coworker gets that look of slight panic, I grab the weapon and holster from the customer, drop the magazine, and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor. I explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out, but it's gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault. For his safety and the safety of others, he's not allowed in there. I also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is.

He's cool with this, and does feel very stupid. I'm can't really fault him too much because we failed at our job too make sure that it really is safe.

So, I take it to the vault and try to figure out how to get this things out safely. I call in two other, more experience co-workers to help figure this out. After some cussing, grumbling, lots of WD-40, and talk about taking a saw to the holster. We finally got it free.

The next day, everyone got a lecture and retaining on weapon safety.

**I'm on the SWAT team**

People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. Sheriffs, at least in my part of the woods, tend to be on the bigger size of things.

This big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his SWAT rig/uniform. He has a purchase order from his department. He needs everything, new body armor, clothing, thigh rig, chest holster, sling for the AR he has to get, new duty belt rig, the whole nine.

The problem? We didn't have anything that fit him.

We can measure for body armor as those are custom made. But the sheet measurements didn't go that big.

Pants? We didn't have anything close to his size. I had to take a measuring tape, or two, to get the guys waist size. We had to order a 6XL. For frame of reference, I'm a size 30 waist. When these pants finally came in, myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people.

Of course, he was offended that everything had to be custom made, that we didn't have it in stock, and would be up charged for the size, which, the department PO didn't take into account.

The horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield. I also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door, have him scream ""OH YEAH!""

1356153859.0,984,self.guns,159oc2,I AMA Soldier who was asked to take weapons from civilians during a disaster relief effort. AMAA,,1382,398,695,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/159oc2/i_ama_soldier_who_was_asked_to_take_weapons_from/,"Just a small bit of back ground. This is my first AMA and I would like to limit what we talk about only mildly. I will not disclose names, locations, or units. I legally am obligated to keep some anonymity as my association to mentioned group is not considered entirely legal. If a mod want's to verify me, I will be more then willing to submit some sort of evidence.

I joined the Army several years ago on the active duty side. I worked as a 35N and eventually went through the selection process. 2 years later I had my 18B. (Yes it took me two complete years or 23 months, yes it is my own damn fault I was recycled). After 7 years on the active duty side I decided I wanted to have a home life so when I ETS'd (got out) I decided to join the National Guard. Joined the Guard and became an LEO on the civilian side.

During a recent national emergency, we were asked if we wanted to volunteer to help get people off of their roofs, provide medical aid, ...etc. So I said yes and a few days later I was in Louisiana. During the course of my stay, we were told by state that they wanted us to start collecting firearms we saw and turn them in. You know it's against the law, I know it's against the law. 

A certain Louisiana guard soldier and I got to talking. Neither he, nor I, nor any of us on the crew wanted to comply. We made a pact that day that we would never, under any circumstance help destroy the nation that we took an oath to protect. We took an Oath and planned to stick to it. We went to the commander and told him our stance and he agreed. At this point in time we started a group known as the Oath Keepers. Any soldier, LEO, Contractor can be an Oath Keeper. So, without further introduction, AMAA

EDIT 1: Quick overview of what an Oath Keeper believes.

You're being very vague. It means that if any of the following happens:

    Orders to disarm the American people.
    Orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people.
    Orders to detain American citizens as “unlawful enemy combatants” or to subject them to military tribunal.
    Orders to impose martial law or a “state of emergency” on a state.
    Orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty.
    Any order to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.
    Any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.
    Orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to “keep the peace” or to “maintain control.""
    Any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies.
    Any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.

That you will not only disobey said order, but that you will do anything and everything, up to and including firing shots, to prevent said order(s) from happening.

EDIT 2: Alright everyone, it's pretty late. I'm going to continue this for however long I can in order to help hopefully comfort some of your fears for the future. I will be back tomorrow. So far I've been able to answer everyone, hopefully I can keep this record up.

Since I, a typical gun owner, am tired of addressing the same questions over and over again, I would like to introduce myself and explain to you why I think it’s a good idea for me to have a gun.

I work in software, and I’m nearly into my 30s. I’m not particularly special in any way. I am the most typical of Americans in that I am actually an immigrant. To be precise, from a liberal, western European country.

I will be the first to admit that I did not immigrate out of desperate need; I came here to make money. That’s fine, I think; it’s something America is good at. I am also a liberal. One of the theories that I subscribe to most dearly is that the state ultimately has a monopoly on violence.

All that being said, I’m a gun owner, and if you try to take it from me, chances are, you’ll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.

A lot of you will now be wondering how those two completely different ideas are compatible - and I will try to explain it to you by addressing some of the most common arguments of those people seeking more restrictive gun control. We’ll start with the most obvious:

*Guns kill people.*

Nonsense. People kill people. Would you prefer I use a sword? This is born out of the false assumption that access to a gun means an easy way to kill many people all at once, and it’s completely untrue. Using a firearm to engage multiple targets is a high art and science, something that most people never master. The stories we hear about, the ones of the school shootings and crazed people shooting up youth camps, are the exception, not the rule. In the scope of things, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than you do of being shot in a classroom. In the past 500 years, the murder rate has consistently decreased - not increased - and that is in the center of the age of gunpowder.

Additionally, anyone who thinks that a gun is a “trump card” for the application of violence doesn’t know what they’re talking about. How you ever heard of the 21 foot rule and/or the Tueller Drill? The 21 foot rule is why cops carry their guns ready-to-fire. The Tueller Drill involves drawing a firearm and shooting a suspect before they can stab you with a knife. The standard distance is 21 feet - and a lot of the time, the guy with the knife wins. Knife wounds are also a last nastier than bullet wounds, and knives are about 10,000 times easier to get than a gun.

*We have too many guns in the hands of criminals.*

That’s absolutely true - but they got there through illegal means. Adding more laws on top of that won’t do a damned bit of good. We should try enforcing the ones that exist, first. Making it harder for law-abiding citizens to get a gun doesn’t make it any harder for criminals to get them. Even in Germany, where private handgun ownership is near impossible, I can assure you, I would have no problem getting a pistol on the black market for a couple of hundred euros.

*Criminals steal guns from private citizens.*

Some do, yes. But most guns end up in the hands of criminals due to poor self-enforcement of firearms laws on private party sales. Very few criminals’ guns are actually stolen.

*Manufacturing more guns makes them easier for criminals to get.*

There are already enough guns in the world to arm us all to the teeth; it’s far beyond making a difference. If you stop manufacturing guns right now, grey and black market handguns will just be replaced by crates of smuggled assault rifles from Africa, where an AKM assault rifle goes for about 50 bucks.

*Owning a gun makes a person more likely to use it.*

That’s true; in the same sense that being punched in the face makes you more likely to lose a tooth.

*Private citizens don’t need guns - the Police should be responsible for the enforcement of law.*

I want to live in the world you live in; I really do. The problem is, it’s a fairy tale. Police enforcement only works when the world is operating normally. However, much too often, the world isn’t operating normally. We don’t need to look as far as a failed state; consider Louisiana during Katrina, or Los Angeles during the riots.

I am not trying to malign Police. I am really glad that cops exist, and they get my respect. They just can’t be everywhere at once. A private gun owner also isn’t trying to replace the state monopoly on violence - they are trying to supplement it. A lot of people then argue that that eliminates the civilian realm from our society. My response is to ask you whether you really think there is one to begin with. We assume that it is the responsibility of everyone to ensure the continuation of modern government by exercising their rights in the political process. We also assume that people exercise their rights in the legal process by participating in jury duty and by engaging attorneys that competently defend. You really think that’s any different in the enforcement process? It wasn’t long ago that, “Stop that thief!” still go people to turn and look - and act.

No, the problem isn’t that the state monopoly of violence is being distributed away from the state. The problem is that through sheer indifference, we’ve failed to supplement it as we historically have. There is long precedent in English common law for the deputization of private citizens. In fact, for a very long time, you were legally required to aid law enforcement. De facto, it is our responsibility as citizens of a society to engage in its defense, against threats both internal and external.

There are other, more fundamentally practical problems involved here as well. I will list some of them just glancingly.
Many areas lack timely police coverage.
Many areas have completely overworked police forces, reducing effectiveness.
Police officers are human beings, too, and will often respond with caution when time is of the essence. This is not an accusation; it’s just how things are. They don’t want to get killed either.
Police can’t predict crime.

*Assault rifles should be banned.*

You’re under the mistaken assumption that an assault rifle is the deadliest form of weapon, just because it’s the most useful to a military. That is incorrect. Ask a cop what they fear the most, and the most common answer will be: “A shotgun”.

Shotguns are far deadlier than assault rifles in an urban setting, and they are one of the few readily available weapons that have a decent chance of nullifying the advantage of a bullet-resistant vest. Why? Because a shell loaded with 00-buck contains 7 to 9 pellets about the size of a handgun bullet. There is a pretty decent chance that at least one of those pellets will hit an important spot not covered by body armor. Yet, we’re not clamoring to ban shotguns. The only reason anyone talks about banning assault rifles is because they sound scary. They aren’t! They’re just a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip, and they usually fire cartridges smaller than regular rifle cartridges, too. The vast majority of assault rifles can’t pierce body armor, but I can get around it with a shotgun, and I can blow straight through it with a sufficiently powerful single shot hunting rifle.

As for assault rifles being used in mass shootings? A handgun is about 10 times easier to keep hidden than an assault rifle, and you can carry a lot more pistol ammo than assault rifle ammo.

*Guns are evil.*

That’s not even worth addressing, but I’ll say a few words anyway. I stipulate that pens are evil because Hitler used one to write Mein Kampf.

*You don’t have a right to shoot someone just because they break into your house.*

Actually, according to the oldest traditions of English Common Law, I do. “A man’s house is his castle” isn’t just a catchphrase; it’s a legal principle. Traditionally, a man’s dwelling is inviolable, and any who do violate it, basically surrender their rights. 

I hope you’ll forgive me for not making the distinction between a really bad criminal, and just a sort-of bad criminal, at 3 o’clock in the morning, when my girlfriend is sleeping in the other room. When my infirm neighbor is asleep. When no one is awake to be summoned for help, and when I might only have one opportunity to shoot first.

*There is no reason to shoot an unarmed man.*

There are plenty of people who can kill with their bare hands. I’m really glad for you if you’ve never experienced a beating, and if you don’t understand what it’s like to get your head knocked against something really hard - but please believe it: it doesn’t take a weapon to kill a human being. We’re fragile creatures.

Obviously, you should try to never have to use lethal force against someone without warning them. However, if it’s obvious they are going to try to commit great violence against me, or if they already are trying to, and I feel I might lose that fight, I have every right to pull the trigger.

Also, from what I understand, most rapists are unarmed.

*There are other ways to solve problems than with violence.*

I agree with you 100%. I will always try to solve a problem non-violently. However, not everyone agrees with me - and there lies the problem.

*But...*

I am sure you can come up with a thousand different arguments. I can come up with a thousand different counterpoints. Here are three basic statements that will nullify most arguments you can bring against guns:
Police can’t be everywhere, all the time.
Society is a contract, and people only obey it as long as they feel it profitable.
There is great evil in this world, and statistically, many people will come face to face with it sometime in their lives.

My small MN town is very anti gun and I have never in my years of being here seen a person openly carry. 

Anyways, my experience overall has been good over about a week. It's a bit nerve wracking at first, but I don't really mind. Overall I only had about 4 things that were ""interesting.""

1) I was in an ice cream shop with some friends. As I walked out there was a family sitting by the door. The little boy instantly screamed ""Look mommy he has a gun!!"" The entire restaurant looked at me, but I just kept walking. As I got on my motorcycle, everyone sitting by the window was staring at me the entire time, as if I was about to commit a crime.

2) In my other daily activities, a guy ran up to me and asked if I could speak with him. He then asks me if I am a police officer. I tell him no, thinking he is about to give me a piece of his mind. He ends up asking me about open carrying and how I have the guts to do it. He had his carry permit, but was worried that he would get kicked out of places. I just gave him my opinion and it ended very positively.

3) Police officers eyed me up at the store, and somewhat followed me to my car. I'm sure they ran my plates but we never had any contact.

4) Went to a different store, with very relaxed employees. As I was paying for the item one of them joked ""you better give him that stuff for free, or else something bad might happen!""

Overall I would recommend trying open carry for those who support it, and I just wanted to give some real life examples of what happened! 

Stay safe.

  The mods of /r/guns are going back to a less political environment in less than 24 hours and I feel we should use this time to make one last plea to the community to contact their reps and make a difference in this political climate. 

First, the AWB is getting [pounded](http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2013/01/30/senate-judiciary-chair-rejects-dianne-feinstein%E2%80%99s-assault-weapons-ban/) harder then a freshmen during Greek week and we need to keep up the pressure.

Second, the gun grabbers seem to be focusing in on that magical magazine limit of ten and have several bills that seek to limit capacity to ten. 

Third, currently, the registration bills only have one sponsor a piece, but it's good to mention them during this operation. 

So, here is what you can do! We will be using this site:

http://www.congress.org/congressorg/mail/?alertid=61046526&amp;amp;type=ML

To send this email (or a similar of your own design) to your reps:

Hello, 

I am writing you to urge you to OPPOSE magazine capacity restrictions, weapons registration and the assault weapons ban. 

Thank you, 

(Your name)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why so short? Well, because there is really no need to go into detail as an intern is likely to see your message and make marks accordingly for what you want your rep to oppose. 

Secondly, we MUST take to the phones. Only this time, we will be pushing the Senate Judiciary committee who recently debated gun violence only yesterday.

Partrick Leahy (Chair, D-Vermont) (202) 224-4242

Chuck Schumer (D - New York) (202) 224-6542

The mods of gunnnit want to suppress politics in this sub since they only want gun topics on their front page.

I guess some people would rather turn a blind eye to what's really happening with peoples rights and look at shitty pictures anyway.

Did other subs censor SOPA when it came around or did they embrace their subscribers, who have an vested interest in the sub, and fight it? What if trees had the same mods as gunnit? Perhaps things would be different today if they too censored politics to a single self-post that get's buried quickly.

We have many more battles to fight. We need to stop this 'politics in this thread' rule and embrace the fact that we need to do more.

1363356708.0,914,self.guns,1acmc8,I had an experience with a local police officer regarding my concealed handgun.  ,coffeemug20,1194,280,865,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1acmc8/i_had_an_experience_with_a_local_police_officer/,"I was driving in the Great State of Kansas with expired registration tags.  We have a small florecent colored sticker that we place on our license plates that signifies whether the car is properly registered up to date or not.  My truck was not.  That is my fault and I fixed it immediately after I met with this officer.
The story:
I was driving the speed limit when I was pulled over for having the incorrect sticker.  I was pulled over and ticketed justly.  The officer asked for my license and registration.  I handed him my drivers license.  He asked again for my registration.  The registration was in my center console underneath my Smith and Wesson.  I said ""my registration is in my center console but I would like to inform you that I have a concealed weapon in the console as well"".  He said ""Do you have any other concealed weapons?"".  I said ""No"".  He asked if I had a Concealed Carry Permit ""Yes"", I said.  ""Please step out of the vehicle and stand over here"".  It was at this moment that I considered arguing and not getting out of the truck but I calmly stood by the curb like he asked.  A minute later he brought me my ticket for the license plate and said ""Have a nice day"".  In the end, he did not look at my gun, Concealed Handgun Permit or vehicle registration.  
My Lesson: This is my lesson, agree or not.  This is not legal advice and I am not a lawyer.  It seems like this guy was just trying to stay safe.  I had the option to be an asshole or a nice guy and in the same way that he has the option to be an asshole or a nice guy.  I informed him of my gun when it became necessary and he took steps to protect himself.  I calmly and politely did what he asked me to do and he was a good guy about it.

When attempting to correct people (politely mind you, at least at first), I have been met with plenty of arguing and a shower of down-votes. And this from a community that (rightfully) goes around correcting people on terms like ‘’clip’’ and ‘’assault rifle.’’ (If you're unclear on the definition of an assault rifle, I've defined it at length [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/150y9a/a_police_officer_demonstrate_the_differences/c7ifgxn).)You’re damn right I’m bitter, but not because I care about karma. I don’t care that I was down-voted; I care that this symbolizes that these errors are not simple mistakes that people are willing to correct, but instead people are accepting the false information being spread around by those who were arguing with me. Yes, I realize I sound arrogant, but bear with me here. Discussion is good. Don’t take what people say at face value without thinking for yourself, but at the same time, if you are uninformed on a subject, perhaps it is best to not argue your point with such a vengeance, without at least doing some research first. I will refrain (at least for the time-being) from linking to any of the aforementioned threads, in order to avoid singling anybody out.

The primary topics I intend to discuss are listed below. If you would like me to discuss any other topics, feel free to comment below or shoot me a PM. If you feel up to the task, write out your own explanation and I will edit it in to my OP (giving you due credit, of course), once we have agreed upon the facts.

* ***Accuracy vs Precision***

* ***“Tolerances”***

* ***Felt Recoil vs Total Recoil***

* ***Loudness***

________________________

***Accuracy vs Precision***

Accuracy for the actual machine that is your rifle is (basically) irrelevant. Yes, you read that correctly. Your rifle doesn’t need to be accurate, it just needs to be *precise*. Let’s define some terms:

**Accuracy** is how close the average result is to the intended result. 

**Precision** is how close each result is to the others.
 
Poor accuracy is easily remedied by zeroing your sights properly. Precision is a result of your barrel, ammo, etc.

The only time accuracy would be relevant for a rifle is if the point of impact is so far out of line with the bore that you physically cannot adjust your sights far enough.

For the shooter, however, both accuracy and precision are important. 10 ‘’accurate’’ shots might make a pretty circle around your target, and 10 precise shots might kill the shit out of the tree next to your target. But neither of those are what you’re aiming for.

Personally, I don't really care if people misuse the term accuracy when talking about their rifle, as there's really only one thing they can be referring to, and that is that the rifle groups tightly. Even though that's not technically what they said.
__________________________

***“Tolerances”***

I see this term thrown around a lot, especially here on /r/guns. It has a very specific meaning, and 99% of the time it’s used here, the person should be saying clearances.

**Tolerances** refer to the permitted variation from the intended dimensions of a completed part in a manufacturing process.

**Clearances** refer to the intended “space” between two parts, i.e. how well they fit together.

**Allowances** refer to the ‘’extra’’ material that is present after a step in a manufacturing process, in order to *allow* for later machining.

Your AK is not more reliable because it has higher ‘’tolerances.’’ High tolerances mean a poorly made firearm. Full stop. High tolerances means the manufacturer was unwilling to spend the money to ensure low variation and high consistency in their product. If your QC allows for a barrel diameter of .220 inches ± .0002 inches, then ~~.0002~~ 0.0004 (thank you /u/nnorton00 and /u/cawpin) inches is your *total* tolerance.

Your AK is reliable because it has high *clearances*, i.e. larger spaces between parts which allow gunk, dirt, and the blood of fascists to build up without affecting the functionality of the firearm. If you have a 1.00 inch wide magazine than must fit into a 1.06 inch wide magazine well, then you have .06 inches of clearance between the two parts. 

Lastly, allowances are basically how much extra material you have to *allow* for later machining. Say you want to thread a barrel. You need it to have a greater diameter than what the final inner diameter of the threads is going to be. If you want threads with an inner diameter of .500 inches, and an outer diameter of .505 inches, you better not make that barrel with an outer diameter of .502 inches, or you want have enough material to make the threads.

__________________________

***Recoil***

Recoil essentially breaks down into two relevant topics – total recoil and felt recoil.

**Force** is the ability to make an object accelerate. How much it accelerates depends on the object’s mass. Force is what causes felt recoil.

**Impulse** is the total change in momentum of an object. Impulse is the total recoil.

The impulse imparted onto the shooter and his rifle is equal 
to the bullet’s muzzle velocity times its mass (plus the momentum that results from the expelled propellant gases - thanks to /u/TwoHands for this addition).

I=∆p=m*v

Where I is impulse, p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity.

You *cannot change the impulse*, given the same load fired out of the same barrel. It does not depend on the mass of the firearm or the mass of the shooter. You can have a manly steel butt plate, as found on glorious Mosin (which is, by the way, the rifle’s proper name, as all Nagant did was design the god damn magazine spring. His name is only used to refer to the rifle in the Western world) of Motherland, or a 5 inch thick rubber sissy pad (I guess I’m a sissy, because recoil pads rock). I don’t care. The impulse is the same. Unless you want to redefine physics and say that the Law of Conservation of Momentum is no longer valid, you cannot change the impulse imparted onto a gun by a bullet of a known weight and muzzle velocity. *Nothing* ‘’absorbs’’ recoil. The closest thing would be a muzzle brake, as this imparts some of the impulse onto the gases (which, of course, have mass) that are being expelled to the rear. Note however that the total impulse is the same, but some of it is being taken out of the system by those gases.

So what *can* you change? Felt recoil. This can be changed in two main ways: by spreading the impulse out over a longer period of time (we’re still talking hundredths of a second here) or by increasing the mass that the recoil is acting on.

The former follows the equation 

I=F*t

Where I is once again impulse, F is average force, and t is the total time of ‘’impact.’’

Rubber butt pads are, in scientific terms, squishy, and serve to increase the time over which the rifle is smashing against your shoulder, thus reducing the average force and overall ouchiness of firing the gun. Another way to increase the time of impact would be to adopt a looser stance (with your body, not your grip. If you don’t hold the stock against your shoulder, it is going to hurt). In the same way that a boxer leans away from a punch to soften the blow, allowing yourself to lean back (as it’s firing, that is. I’m not referring to the infamous “chick lean”) with the gun will decrease felt recoil. You may have seen this in some videos of people shooting large bore rifles or shotguns. Bending your elbows has the same effect for handguns.

The second way of reducing felt recoil is by increasing the mass of the firearm.

F=m*a

Where F is still force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. A more massive gun will cause a lesser acceleration of the gun into your face than a lighter gun, simple as that. This is why shooting the 2’’ .357mag S&amp;W airweight revolver that the RSO handed to you with a grin on his face on the first day you ever shot a gun feels like getting stabbed in the hand, whereas shooting the 6’’ .357mag S&amp;W 686 next to it is rather pleasant, despite them both firing the same round. But I’m totally not speaking from personal experience, so make of that what you will.

__________________________

***Loudness***

**Well, fuck me. Due to large disagreements on the proper multipliers for loudness and power, I am going to remove the numbers from the first half of this section, since they were anyways only intended to serve as examples to further the general ideas. Instead they caused confusion. Thus, off with their heads!**

~~(Thank you to /u/Szalkow for correcting me here. Loudness scales by a factor of 2 for every +10 dB, not a factor of 10. I was incorrectly talking about power.)~~

This topic I will only cover very briefly, as there’s really not much to say about it that relates to shooting. I won’t define any terms (except upon request) as most of them should be fairly obvious.

The scale used to describe the loudness of a sound is logarithmic, and uses the unit decibel, which is one tenth of a “Bel” and is shortened dB. What does it mean that it’s logarithmic? It means that instead of a linear system, where 110 dB would be 110% as loud as 100 dB, 110 dB is actually multiple times as loud.

A suppressor or ear plug that decreases the muzzle report by 30 dB is decreasing the sound by orders of magnitude. This is a big fucking deal. USE YOUR HEARING PROTECTION. ALWAYS.

The second and final point I will make on this subject is that sound decreases as a function of the square of the distance from the source. This means that if you are twice as far away as your friend is from the gun being fired, then it is ¼ as loud for you as it is for him. If you’re operating the weapon, your ears are probably about two feet from the muzzle if you’re firing a rifle with a long barrel. Consider that if you are firing an SBR, your ears may be up to twice as close to the muzzle, making the sound 4x as loud. 

This has not taken into account the effect of muzzle brakes/compensators. Most of the sound from a gun without any muzzle devices is ‘’projected’’ forward. However, if you add a muzzle brake to your firearm, this is going to direct a large amount of the gases rearward, and the sound will go along with them. 

____________________________

So there’s my guide. If you find any errors, do make sure to let me know so that we can spread accurate information, instead of contributing to the problem of misinformation.

**TL;DR** I would say ‘’screw you this took me over an hour to write so read the whole damn thing,” but I want this information to be available to you, even if you have better shit to do than read five pages of techno-babble.

* A good gun is precise. Accuracy for the gun comes from properly zeroing it. A good shooter is both accurate and precise (consistent).

* If you’re saying your gun has high tolerances as though that’s a good thing, you probably should be talking about clearances.

* Felt recoil is how much it hurts. Total recoil is how much it’s ‘’pushing’’ you. Felt recoil is easy to decrease with butt pads and heavier guns, total recoil is only really affected by muzzle brakes and mounts/bipods/tripods (none of these will truly affect the recoil, but they’ll direct it into the ground/air rather than the shooter).

* Sound is measured on a logarithmic scale, not a linear scale. An increase in 10 dB is not slightyl louder, it is several times louder. Loudness decreases by the square of the distance from the gun, so standing 2x as far from the gun makes it 4x quieter, and 3x as far away makes it 9x quieter. Wear your goddamn ear protection.

&gt;HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ON THURSDAY: 

&gt;1. Call Senator Dave Syverson at (217) 782-5413 and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

&gt;2. Call Senator Shane Cultra at (217) 782-6597 and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

&gt;3. Call Senator Christine Johnson at (217) 782-1977 and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

&gt;4. Call Senator Carole Pankau at (217) 782-9463 and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

&gt;It is very important that you praise these Senators for their support. 
The ringleader of the effort to shut down shooting ranges and take your guns away from you is **Senator Dan Kotowski**. You may wish to call him at **(217) 782-3875** and politely explain to him that, as a law-abiding gun owner, you do not appreciate being treated like a criminal and that you oppose any efforts to regulate shooting ranges, ban semiautomatic firearms, or ban standard capacity magazines

EDIT: Added info on senators to contact - I hope this info is OK, these are public records and the numbers to their OFFICES - I do not believe any of this info is personal and is all readily available online.

EDIT2: We're having an impact, just read this from someone onsite: ""Senator John Milner has removed himself as a co-sponsor of HB1263.""  Senator Milner's office can be reached at (630) 762-6255 - be sure to add him to list of those to thank for standing up for us today.

EDIT:  It's interesting to watch the headlines evolve on Google News.  9 shot by gunman &gt; 2 dead, 9 wounded in attack &gt; 2 dead, several ""injured"" &gt; 2 dead in E.S.B. Shooting.

**EDIT2:** They keep updating the linked article, but now

&gt;One law enforcement official said that based on the preliminary investigation, **it appears that most or all of the bystanders were struck by one of the 16 police bullets** – or fragments or ricochets from those rounds – that were fired by the two officers who confronted Mr. Johnson.

Either way, this guy was not going around shooting innocent bystanders as was initially claimed.. He went in, shot a guy, put his gun away and then later was confronted by police and drew on them.

EDIT3: NYT article headline now changed to not mention that anyone was hurt. One gunman shot and killed by police.

**EDIT4: It's been said by several people, but kudos to the officer on the left in the video who was obviously trained and practiced.

""A STATEMENT FROM RONNIE BARRETT:

Barrett’s Position Regarding the Assault on Liberty
February 20, 2013

Barrett opposes those who are illegally disarming the American public from their efficient arms and creating superior armed elitist government agencies. 

Elected state officials of New York, having been sworn to protect our Constitution, have instead committed an offense against it and their citizens by stripping inalienable rights duly protected and guaranteed under the Second Amendment. By their deliberate and sinister actions, these officials now cause their state and local policing agencies to enforce these unconstitutional and illegal so called “laws”. 

By current law, Barrett cannot be an accomplice with any lawbreaker, therefore, cannot and will not service or sell to New York government agencies. Barrett also applies this stance to the individual elected official who, as a matter of public record, has voted for or created regulation that violates the constitutional rights of their citizens. This is an expansion of our 2002 ban against the California government due to their second amendment infringements, and shall apply to any future violators. 

In the course of world history there have been officials that strip inalienable rights from the people that were given to all by our Creator. Most of these officials inevitably come to trial, some do not. 

Intentionally violating constitutional rights by officials that have sworn to uphold them should have severe prison sentences. 

With the clear vision of horrible events in history repeating itself, all manufacturers of firearms or related equipment remaining in partnership with such violators should have a respectable fear of being found with the guilty on their day of trial. 

During this era of assault on liberty, Barrett will remain steadfast in our efforts to serve law-abiding citizens of all fifty states, and stands together with you in the struggles we will fight and win.

What better resource to have than such a varied group of individuals sharing knowledge about a subject that they all enjoy?

""Wow, an online resource for shooters and reloaders!"" But then the realization hits that this forum like all forums has its negative side. Im specifically talking about the belittling comments ""correcting people"" on the posture of someones wife shooting a pistol, someone mistakenly being off by a letter on a gun model, someone voicing an opinion different than your self proclaimed ""expert"" opinion. Can people just take a step back off from being a know-it all long enough to treasure and enjoy what a great community this is?

[–]sewiv 50 points 2 days ago

It's fantastic to see another new shooter out there.

However, speaking as an NRA certified basic pistol instructor:

    That lean. Shoulders in front of hips. It's not at all a question of strength, it's a question of proper form. It doesn't take any more time to learn the right way than to learn the wrong way, but UN-learning the wrong way takes forever.

    That grip. When I'm teaching new woman shooters, I use the phrase ""thumbs love each other, they like to hug"" to get them to put their thumbs together. Corny, but it works.

    Feet are way too far apart. Shoulder width apart or a touch more or less, toes approximately aligned, at about a 45 degree angle to the target, weak foot forward. Knees unlocked, about a 55/45 weight split front/rear. Shoulders in front of hips.

    She really should be starting with a .22. Every single thing you need to know about shooting handguns, you can learn on a .22, except recoil management, and a proper grip and stance takes care of that for you.

    Unlocked elbows are okay, but seriously bent like that is not. Much better recoil management with straighter arms, and you can do isometric tensioning more easily with straighter arms.

Learning the basics correctly, right from the start, makes it all so much easier.

That said, I'd rather teach a non-shooter any day over trying to help someone who thinks they already know how to shoot. There's also the old adage of ""Don't try to teach your SO how to shoot or how to drive a stick. Let someone else do it.""


TL:DR Quit being a know-it all! Try and help people.

After hearing his plight my dad called 911, provided our location, and I holstered my XDM 9mm from my apartment.

I stood under a light since I didn't want to surprise them when they arrived, however I honestly was expecting at least a little hassle. As they approached I ensured my side arm was in clear view, as well as my hands. The first officer looked me up and down and at this point my mind was racing through all of the police encounter videos I've seen on youtube. I was interrupted by him saying ""If you two weren't involved you're free to go,"" I stammered a bit and left as quickly as I could, a bit caught off guard that it didn't even begin to follow the movie that had just played in my head.

He'd expressed an interest in firing a gun so with his mother's permission I'd planned to take him to the range during his recent visit.  

After several hours of orientation and instruction over a couple of days we headed off for our local indoor pistol range.  By the time we got there he was nervous but excited.  We donned our eyes and ears and proceeded into the range.  The gun for the day was Heritage Manufacturing Rough Rider .22LR.  Nothing fancy, but a fun little plinker.

We weren't alone in the range.  My wife was in the next lane testing out our new Sig Sauer P938.  My nephew jumped the first time she fired it, but after that he seemed fine.  I fired the revolver a few times so he'd get a sense for what to expect.  When he was ready, I unloaded the gun so he could practice his form.  When he said he was ready, I loaded it, disengaged the safety, and handed it to him.  He aimed and...

...nothing.

He kept the barrel pointing down range the whole time, but after a minute he announced he wasn't ready to pull the trigger... and that's OK.  I give him a lot of credit for getting as far as he did, and even more credit for deciding to take a step back.  Good for him, and we'll try again when he feels he's ready.

All in all, it was a successful day at the range.

Not 5 minutes into the match there was an ND that resulted in a double through and through to the thigh and lower leg.

Here's how it went down and here's how it was handled.  The shooter was given the load and make ready command, which he did.  While reholstering, BANG, then lots of screaming and four letter words.  The .45 entered his upper thigh and exited just above the knee then re-entered his upper calf and exited his lower calf.  The match director and ROs went into crisis management mode - and they calmly did a great job.  There were at least 2 EMTs shooting the match.  One immediately starting treating the patient, the other went and retrieved his well stock personal trauma bag (there is a trauma bag present at all matches that's provided by the club).  The match director called 911 to report the accident and that the patient was currently being treated for a non life threatening injury.  He then went out to the club entrance to lead EMS right to the scene.  The ROs had everyone unholster and bag up their guns and move away from the bay where the accident occurred.  The match director and ROs handled this like pros.

Last week I took a ton of shit for a post describing a HiPoint shooter who was DQ'd from a match for gross safety violations.  This is what happens when people don't/can't follow the rules.  Shooting accidents are rarely minor and often fatal.  This is why safety violations are treated as a DQ'ing offense.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1370282447.0,,,True,t3_1fkt93,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1fkt93/self_inflicted_nd_wound_during_a_match/,

I help out at my range. It is a private range. Every month against our better judgement, we let new members in. According to the club bylaws, all new members have to demonstrate they can handle a firearm in a safe fashion.

Sounds reasonable right? Wrong. 

Since Obama won - it went from 10 people joining the club a month to 110. Men who have NEVER shot a gun before show up with their wives who have NEVER shot a gun before and they expect us to teach their wives how to shoot during this demonstration. It is not pretty. This is one of the stories.

I usually have at least ONE person that fails miserably, pointing a gun over the berm, at a neighbor - sometimes I'm able to grab the wrist before it's too late.....but all we can do is tell them what they did wrong and the club still lets them in. I have no idea why we do this this way. I was helping out along with about 5 other people and a woman walks up to the RO 10 feet away from me.

RO asks her if she's shot the gun before. She says yes. 

He tells her to load her gun, and when she's ready to hit berm. We have very lax criteria here - if you can hit a 20 foot wall of dirt, you passed. 

So she has problems loading the magazine. Maybe her husband does it for her....anyways, the RO loads the magazine for her.

She has problems loading the gun. Maybe her husband does it for her....anyways, the RO loads the gun for her. 

She picks it up. Pulls the trigger. Bang. Bullet hits the backstop. 

THE WOMAN FLIPS OUT!

She drops the gun on the bench and takes several steps back - visibly alarmed. We're wondering what's going on.

Woman: ""MY GUN IS BROKEN! I NEED TO SEND IT BACK TO THE FACTORY! MY GUN IS BROKEN! ITS NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE!""

We're wondering what's going on - so she goes on to explain.

Woman: ""It kicked! AND it made a loud noise! It never made that noise before!""

The plot thickens. It kicked AND it never made that noise before? We're intrigued.

Apparently - her gun owning husband (trapshooter no less, never ever ever shot a pistol) got her a pistol and showed her how to dryfire it at home. She thought she was actually shooting the gun - so when it actually made a noise, she wasn't accustomed to it. 

In short: Private ranges are also full of idiots. ",,False,,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,t3_vldea,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/vldea/my_gun_is_broken_its_never_done_that_before/,

A.) Vote for Mitt Romney and B.) Renew my membership. It started with the basic stuff about ""are you aware that x number of years ago Barack Obama supported a ban on x, y, and z?"" and then on to renewing my membership so we could send a message to Washington that they have to be held accountable. 

-----
Me: Actually, that's sort of why my membership lapsed in the first place. I'm actually a registered Democrat and I thought the NRA had become too political and was excluding liberals. In my opinion the best way to secure second amendment freedoms is to attract new gun owners and new shooters, not to exclude half the country. 

NRA Rep (Barely controlling his rage): I understand sir... believe me I do, may I place you on hold for a second? 

(I was on hold for about 3 minutes, nearly hung up but I wanted to see what he had to say and it was a nice distraction from housework.)

NRA Rep (Still speaking through clenched teeth): Sir, you were saying that part of the reason for not renewing your membership was that we only support Republicans and not Democrats? (I did not actually say this.)

Me: Well, I know there's a few token Democrats every year that the NRA sponsors but basically it boiled down to this; Every month I'd get an inflammatory postcard or something with really rude aggressive language saying 'send this to the politicians in Washington!' and it would want me to address it to Nancy Pelosi or someone. I just don't think being rude and hostile is how you get people to support your cause. 

NRA Rep: (*Click*)

-----

So, there you go. Whether you agree with me and my position on the NRA or not, it seems that the NRA, or this rep in particular don't want feedback on why people left. FWIW. I donate instead to the Second Amendment Foundation. I find them to do a lot more lawyering and a lot less fear mongering. Sure, I don't get the monthly magazine dripping with ads and positively glowing gun reviews (HOLY COW! TAURUS RIP OFF OF THE YEAR!! 5 STARS!! ONLY JAMMED 10 TIMES DURING OUR TRIAL!) but I think it's a fair trade.

Stephen Dargan",lesser_imp,1086,301,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/15y8eq/ct_gun_owners_the_names_addresses_of_170000/,"**The names &amp; addresses of 170,000 permit holders in CT, now kept confidential by law, could be made public under a bill proposed by Rep. Stephen Dargan**

For some reason, this *“public servant”* thinks that publicizing the names and addresses of law abiding permit holders (and presumably gun owners) will help to reduce gun violence.  

His solution to the tragedy in Newtown?  Making it easier for criminals (thanks to whichever intrepid, half-retarded journalist actually FOI’s and publishes the list) to get their hands on guns by taking them from law abiding citizen’s homes.

From today’s *Hartford Courant*:
“The names and addresses of about 170,000 handgun permit holders in Connecticut, now kept confidential by law, could be made public under a proposed bill that pits gun owners against would-be reformers in the aftermath of the Dec. 14 Newtown school massacre.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Stephen D. Dargan, D-West Haven, co-chairman of the legislature's public safety committee, would make public the names and addresses of permit holders under Connecticut's Freedom of Information Act — and would reverse lawmakers' decision to protect that personal information from disclosure nearly two decades ago.

""Most things are FOI-able now,"" Dargan said in an interview Thursday. ""Go to the local city clerk's office and you can find out where Steve Dargan owns property,"" as well as what cars a person owns and perhaps some of his debts. ""I don't know why a responsible gun owner is worried about whether a permit for a revolver is FOI-able or not.""”

The gun shops run by the long-winded / narrow-minded individuals who are infallible and ""everyone else is wrong"".  Lately there has been a plethora of posts by these select few bemoaning the contributions by those who aren't them.  

The thing they don't even consider is that these ""look at my first gun"" pics or ""which CCW is best?"" inquiries are probably posts by those new to firearms ownership or looking to get into it.  And by greeting them with disdain and complaints of ""lack of original content"" it just exacerbates the long-standing reputation of gun owners being unapproachable snobs and that if you aren't inherently versed in the subject you should just go away and 'not bother us big boys' with your newbie questions and opinions.  

In a forum of 40k subscribers a handful are trying to dictate content **they** want to see.  And it wouldn't be wrong if they did it in a manner of soliciting ideas and building a community from there.  But to do it by blatantly disrespecting and condescending folks?  That is just another manifestation of BMOC syndrome - having a power trip because they happen to know a few more technial details or because they have a clique that follows the hive mindset.  

When I first joined Gunnit I was excited that a community of shooters/gun owners had been able to transcend the typical bullshit of elitism and showed camaraderie towards one another - across all skill/knowledge levels.  Then, the most vocal (i.e. those with the most free time in the day to post/comment on everything) slowly began to exert their influence.  As their cronies cheered them on, they thrived on the attention, and suddenly Gunnit changed.  

There is no question that technical knowledge is a desired evolution of gun ownership.  The more you learn, the more fun it becomes.  But that skill set doesn't give you the right to pass judgement on those newer to firearms owership and belittle their attempts at being involved in the community.  This is Gunnit - not (enter username)'s personal forum. 

This post may get downvoted into oblivion - it may be met with shouts of ""good riddance"" - and I'll probably get accused of being too sensitive for the internet.  So be it.  But as a parting shot to the jackasses who have probably driven away a plethora of others before me?  Have your damn forum.  I'm going to go spend my time with a better class of people.

NYPD officer here to answer any questions. Here are some facts:

•Every officer hired since the introduction of pistols in the NYPD back in the early nineties is NOT allowed to use a revolver as their service weapon. They must choose between a Glock 19, S&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;W 5946, or a Sig p226. All of these guns are in DAO variant and have NO external safety. 

•Everyone who is allowed to carry a gun in the department (not everyone is) has to re-qualify once every six months (give or take, it's been as short as five and as long as nine sometimes).

•MOST NYPD officers fire their FIRST gun, ever in their entire lives, at the police academy, some as young as 21 to as old as 35 shooting for their very first time, and on a DAO pistol.

•The qualifications are HORRIBLE mad get dumbed down every year.

•The NYPD offers once a month training for members to use, on their own time. However, all that is done during these sessions are the same basic dumbed down qualification exercises. You will only receive real help if you outright fail. Missed 12 out of fifty @ 7 yards? GOOD ENOUGH!

•Our tactical training is a joke and maybe ten people in a department of 34K have had Active Shooter training (I'm not exaggerating).

There is a lot broken, basically.

Some of our members NEVER take their service weapons out of their gun belts, and never carry ANYTHING off duty. I've seen people with 3 years on have brown rusted rear sights. Some never clean their weapons unless forced to by the firearms unit.

The NYPD has been tight fisted with ammo for the longest time. Take your one box and be happy.

I'll answer any questions you guys have.

PS: Our holsters are shit also.

EDIT: Replaced DOA with DAO

EDIT: It's true, twelve pins trigger springs suck

EDIT: We at only allowed Gen3 Glocks.

UPDATE: Guys I'll be back tomorrow morning and I might send the verification to HCE.

Verification Update: I'm not sending any pictures of anything. The purpose of this throwaway is just to answer any questions you all might have. I'm sorry but that's the way it will be. I will probably keep answering until the end of the week, then I will delete this account or let the mods archive it if they want.

Today I went out on a hike.  Park in the parking area, get out my AR and backpack because there is a great spot to shoot out to 3 or 400 yards up in these mountains. Walk past the gates and 100 yards up the trail, and low and behold there is a tree down across the trail, a decent sized 10 inch birch.   There was a pretty big wind storm the day before, so I originally thought that is what did it.  Get a little closer and realize that no, it wasn't wind.  It was some dickbag who went to Walmart and bought 5 boxes of 12 gauge and sawed the fucking tree down with it.  He also got the tops of 5 other trees, and a bunch of limbs.  Shot shells all over the place, the empty boxes strewn across the ground, and of course, idiots plastic walmart  bag.  

We all know this asshole.  Some of you ARE this asshole.  And these assholes are threat number one to our right to shoot on public land.  Those of us who have been shooting for a long time know this.  How many public ranges were available when you first started verses now?  Half?  A quarter?  Range cleanup days are not enough, the behavior needs to change.  Its no longer acceptable to have a shooting spot be absolutely trashed.  More people are out in the woods than ever, and many of them are not shooters.  What sort of impression does it make when they drive by a range and it is absolutely covered in shotgun shells, brass, cardboard, glass, clays, and whatever the fuck else someone wants to shoot.  Its disgusting.  

What really set me off on this today was that I had a new shooter with me.  Someone who had never even held a gun before. I purposely took her to a remote hike in spot, just so she wouldn't see a nasty, trashed range. And here we are, out in these beautiful woods, looking at a tree some cockbag thought it would be fun to shoot.  What an amazing impression, having to go out into the woods and clean up this guys mess.  

I have been shooting twice this week.  Both times I was disgusted by what I found just hiking out in the woods.  So, both times I packed out a bunch of other people crap out with me.  The first time I swore I was going to start carrying a garbage bag in my pack to pick stuff up on the way out.  Of course, I forget this trip, and we ended up filling that walmart bag to the brim with shot shells and anything else we could find.  I encourage all of you to do the same.  But I also encourage you to start calling people out on this shit.  You see somebody doing something shitty, tell them to knock it the fuck off.  Make sure the people around you are cleaning up after themselves.  Even better if you can get them to do a little extra.  If you want a place to shoot in 10 years, you think about this.  People don't put up with litter and trash anymore.  They wont accept that putting up a public range is basically just putting up signs that say its ok to completely trash this area, and you wont be held accountable.

I almost put it back since I was already taking five other guns, but I figured ""aww, what the heck"" and bagged it up, thinking that it would make a good warm-up gun and that 30 rounds of .22LR would go pretty quickly anyways.

I ran through my drills (after waiting an hour - my local range is always packed on the weekends), and was cleaning up my lane when I noticed a family of two young boys (one looked to be 7-8, and the other about 10 years old) and their parents getting started in the next lane over. The father shot his Beretta 92FS, and then had the older boy shoot it - he did pretty well, shooting a 5-shot group at 5 yards that many people would be envious of. Then it was the younger boy's turn. I finished packing up and turned to the range officer, telling him that I was done and that my lane was free. When I turned back, the younger boy was crying and being consoled by his mother, and I instantly knew what must have happened: the boy had tried to take a shot and found the gun too much for him to handle. I looked at their gear, and it seemed that they only had the one pistol, and that was it. I knew what to do.

I asked them if they had any smaller guns with them - they said ""no"". I offered to have him shoot my Model 18; I went straight into teaching mode. I had him dryfire it a couple times to get used to the manual of arms, then loaded it up and had him put a cylinderful downrange. When he was done, his older brother and then his mother gave it a go. The younger boy took another turn on the trigger, and then he sat down on a chair behind the line with a smile: rather than having to sit out while his brother and parents got to have all the fun, he got to sling some lead with the big boys.

I gave my pistol league business card to the parents and left, remembering that I had to feed my brother's cats. I'm really glad I decided to bring a .22 to the range today (though I wish it was a smaller J-frame; the kid was having trouble getting a good grip on the K-frame), and glad I was at the right place and time to have made someone's day.

Thread starter wrote:

&gt;Considering the current legislation regarding standard capacity magazines is likely to pass a senate vote and receive the full blessing of Hickenlooper, would Magpul consider a period of direct sales to CO residents before leaving. We're being screwed by this legislation despite all we have done to stop it, would Magpul help flood the Colorado market before departure to help offset the damage of the new law for residents? Most of us I believe support your decisions to move operations if the state passes hb 13-1224, but we also lose in the process. Could anyone from Magpul comment on this proposition?

Magpul responded with:

&gt;We are working on something for this. Stand by.

So if youre in CO you might be in luck and get your hands on a bunch of Pmags before the BS starts flyin.

1303687074.0,742,self.guns,gwl0v,Why Harry Potter should have carried an M1911,Whind_Soull,1181,439,441,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/gwl0v/why_harry_potter_should_have_carried_an_m1911/,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out:  Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk?  Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express.  Worried about its Medusa-gaze?  Wear night vision goggles.  The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes.  You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters?  Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds.  Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons.  Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins.  God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say:  ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!""  Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies).  But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill.  I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that.  Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core.  Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second.  Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. 

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,t3_gwl0v,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/gwl0v/why_harry_potter_should_have_carried_an_m1911/,

My funds had not been deposited into my account in 7 days.  
I emailed them asking why and here is what they said...  

&gt;Hi Charles,

&gt;I apologize for the delay in reaching out to you. There was some research I had to perform regarding your account. Everything appears in order however, the transaction you recently processed for the firearm sale on Gunbroker.com is the reason your account was suspended and referred to my desk. Section 6 of the Merchant User Agreement which prohibits Internet, mail, or telephone order transactions for firearms or weapons. Those types of sales put a stop to all deposits.

&gt;Because this transaction for $1625.00 was for a firearm that was sold when the card was not present, I need to ask you to agree to abide by the Agreement and no longer process transactions of this nature. All you will need to do is respond to this email agreeing to no longer process mail, telephone, or Internet transactions of this type using Square. You can use Square for any other type of transaction not listed in the section I referenced above.

&gt;To read more about the User Agreement, please see: https://squareup.com/legal/ua

&gt;Please respond before 4 pm PDT tomorrow (Friday) since I do not work weekends and would like to help you resolve this matter quickly. You can respond after that but I only check email once on Saturday and Sunday. I appreciate your patience and cooperation throughout this inquiry.

&gt;David
Square Account Services  

And the email I sent back    

&gt;I do not understand why there is a restriction on a legitimate sale of an inanimate object. I think this is absolutely ridiculous.  

&gt;I agree to not use Square for this type of sale ever again.   
But I also agree to never use or recommend this service again.  

&gt;I thank you for your time, and understanding.    

Here is their website  
https://squareup.com/  

Here is their Support Email  
compliance@help-messaging.squareup.com  

I will update when I get an answer back.    


**Small Edit: I wrote this in a comment below. I feel it adds to this.**  

People vehemently avoid PayPal because of their history with firearms.  
I am merely trying to point out the obvious.  
I have the *possibility* of loosing quite a good bit of money from this little predicament I find myself in.  

Here are two quotes from people on other forums that add to the aggravation.  
&gt;This is odd because my local forum just had a group buy of 100 AR15 lowers @ $250ea go through without issue with Square.

&gt;It wasn't with GB but with a firearms manufacturer.  

and  

&gt;Never had an issue with square and I'm an ffl. 
 
&gt;I swipe and punch stuff in manually. When we switched to square we made it very clear what we were and what we sell and they were ok with it.  

Now, if they are bothering me about this and those two are fine I have a **HUGE** problem with their business practice. 

**Edit:**  

They have unfroze my account.  

This is a response to an email someone sent in  
&gt;We regret that you will not be using our services, but we’d like to clarify our policy on firearm sales. Due to federal and state regulations, we prohibit firearms and weapon sales when the transaction is not made in person. Mail order, phone, and internet sales of weapons, where the credit card number is manually-entered into Square, involve situations where we, and the weapons merchant, cannot confirm the identity of the buyer.
Our policy, however, does allow in-person transactions for firearms and other weapons when the credit card is swiped on our card reader. In addition, parts, ammunition, and other accessories are permissible for card-not-present transactions.
More information about Square’s Merchant User Agreement can be found here:
https://squareup.com/legal/merchant-ua
Section 6 provides additional details regarding prohibited businesses.
Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

**Full Edit and conclusion.**
&gt;A little update. The buyer cancelled the sales so all is well.  
I just wanted to inform you of the bug.  



&gt;I would like to apologize for my harsh words.  
I was told by many people that Square had all the legal right in the world to simply keep my funds.  
I was extremely angry and acted out of impulse.  
I still hope to do business with you guys in the future.  
and I understand that it is more about the possibility of CC fraud then it is the actual firearms.  
If you would have worded your response a little different I think that is what you meant, right?

I went to the Poughkeepsie-area gun show today, which was, by most accounts, rather disappointing. Lots of milsurp gear and *lots* of knives, not that many guns, and no good prices. In one corner was a guy who sounded like he was from the Bronx or near there, selling Mausers, mosins, and a few other older rifles.

I spent some time looking at the mosins, all cosmoline-infused 91/30s, partially to see if *all* mosin bolts are as hard to operate as mine is. While playing with a few, a couple of guys came up, commented on the price, and were trying to get the guys attention to ask him a few questions. I happily answered all their questions for them, and informed them that I personally owned one.

While they were there, a few other gentlemen, older guys, stopped by, and asked me a few questions about the mosins as well. This trend continued, and after awhile, I guess people assumed I worked there, and continued asking me mosin questions. After about 20 minutes of showing a few very interested guys what was what, including visually showing them how to take them apart (without actually doing so) and telling them my experience with cosmoline (terrible gunk, but easy enough to remove) three guys bought a mosin. For the seller, that's about $330, since he priced them at 109.99. After the gentlemen left, I asked him about my bolt-question, we spoke for a few minutes, and he looked at me and said ""you really know your mosins... thanks for the sales."" and handed me $40 in a handshake. I didn't see the money ;til it was in my hand, but when I tried to give it back, he insisted.

The math: $10 entrance fee, $18 for 3 ammo cans, $2 for parking, means I spent $30, and made $40. I'll call that a good day. Thanks for reading!",,False,,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,t3_q5lny,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/q5lny/so_i_made_10_at_a_gun_show_today/,

They are tools, for a specific purpose, and enable a 98lb woman to stand up to her 300lb male attacker. Civilized people use tools, especially tools which allow equality and productivity, as opposed to those which impose rule of brute force and inequality and destruction.

At MidwayUSA, Brenda and I - along with the MidwayUSA Employees - have celebrated a good many 'one million' milestones during the last 35+ years.

In 1983, our seventh year in business, we reached the milestone of one million dollars in business during a single calendar year. 2008 was the first year we filled one million orders for our Customers. In 2012 your NRA ""Round-Up"" contributions, through MidwayUSA, exceeded one million dollars during that single year. Please note that NRA ""Round-Up"" contributions come from you, our Customers, and each week since 1992 we have sent your contributions directly to the NRA/ILA National Endowment for the Protection of the 2nd Amendment. Our Customers should get all the credit for that, we just collect and remit your money. Now, in March of 2013 came another milestone to celebrate - one million active Customers - Customers who have ordered from MidwayUSA during the last twelve months. For a country kid from Missouri, that's an amazing milestone.

I believe our vision to be the best-run, most-respected business in America, for the benefit of our Customers, our family values and our relentless pursuit of Customer Satisfaction are what brought us to this milestone of one million active Customers. Brenda and I, along with all the Employees at MidwayUSA, thank you very much for your support.

As you might imagine, we gave quite a bit of thought as to how we could celebrate. Should we choose our one millionth active Customer and give he or she a special gift? Well, we could have done that, but all of our Customers are equally important, not just the one who put us over the top. Then someone came up with the idea that we should donate $1 to the NRA for each of our active Customers. Well, let's see, what is $1 times one million?

And so it was! On Monday morning about 10am, when we went over one million active Customers, MidwayUSA authorized our bank to send a wire transfer of one million dollars to the NRA/ILA National Endowment for the Protection of the 2nd Amendment; because we can and because we should.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,t3_19nvm3,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/19nvm3/midway_does_it_again_email_they_just_sent_out/,

I live about 5 min from the range and spent about 01h30 away from home.  

When I got back I found the bedroom to be ravaged and one of the back windows had been forced open. Armed myself, called the police (or as you Americans call it: the five-o, ammirite?) and went straight to the gun safe and found it to be still there, but someone really went to town on it with a crowbar. They managed to mangle it pretty well but it did not budge. 

Unfortunately my ammo was in another safe that was not bolted into the wall and they took off with the entire safe (had a few 1000 rounds of various calibers in there, plus the safe would've weighed 100+kgs) as well as some jewelry.  

Anyway the 400 euros I paid for that safe was well worth what it was protecting (among which were some heavily customized raceguns). I'm also very glad that my guns didn't fall into the hands of worthless scum.

Really? 

**ANOTHER EDIT:** **[Check out this poll on the new rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/vd2ik/poll_on_current_rules/)**

**MORE EDITS BELOW: See ""No asking questions about illegal firearms modifications**

**EDIT: Updating some points to make myself a little more clear**

So apparently, this subreddit decided that people need more rules to keep things orderly. I think it's highly ironic that a subreddit that despises states like California and Illinois for their oppressive state laws wants to do the same thing in our little forum here. Here's a break down of the idiocy I see here:


* **All posts must be gun related.**

Sure, this is /r/guns. But sometimes there are non gun related or loosely related posts that I, and many others really enjoy. For example:

[Not strictly gun related, but Buck Compton died yesterday (Band of Brothers)](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/qa9dg/not_strictly_gun_related_but_buck_compton_died/)

[It is mildly gun related. And awesome. - [6:38]](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/m2fwq/it_is_mildly_gun_related_and_awesome/)

[A bit off topic for this subreddit, but Tannerite is legal because it is a binary explosive. Does this mean ANFO is legal too?]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/phf8g/a_bit_off_topic_for_this_subreddit_but_tannerite/)

[The 4 Basic Rules of Explosives Safety ](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/embs6/the_4_basic_rules_of_explosives_safety/)

My point is, yes this is a gun community. But sometimes there are other things I may or may not want to discuss with like-minded gun owners and gun-appreciators other than guns. If the community doesn't want to talk about it, they can (and will) downvote it into oblivion. No moderation required.

**EDIT:** For everyone that is saying the Buck Compton post was stupid, I propose an alternate, more acceptable post title: ""Buck Compton (Easy Company, 501st PIR, WW2) died yesterday, also check out the terminal ballistics of this .32 S7W wadcutter."" Fuck.


* **No memes.**

[Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/7cL4A.png)
Some people find meme's amusing. Some don't. Let the upvotes/downvotes decide. 

**EDIT:** Personally, I think 1 in every 2000 meme image actually contributes in someway to my day. I have downvote a shit-ton of them. But if Joe Schmo makes a firearm related meme that makes a few people chuckle, and gets a few hundred upvotes, should it be moderated? What about memes in the comments? What about non-visual memes? Like soviet russia, RAKE, RIFLE IS FINE, ಠ_ಠ, etc? No memes right? 

How about we let /r/guns use goddamn discretion, and if they fuck it up, downvote the shit out of them. 


* **No rage comics.**

Here are some rage comics you might miss out on if you head is planted firmly up your ass:

[Tales of working in a gun shop](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/pe449/tales_of_working_in_a_gun_shop_1/)

[See these guys coming a mile away](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/rw26m/see_these_guys_coming_a_mile_away_gun_rage/)

[Gun shop employees](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/rx5bo/gun_shop_employees/)

Again, if this shit ain't your cup of tea, downvote it. 

**EDIT:** Got it, lots of you really hate rage comics. I'm not partial either. Again, I always choose discrection over censorship.


* **No posting of another users' personal information.**

This is already in the reddit general rules. Perhaps you could just say all rules that apply to the reddit in general apply here. Or you could just leave it out. 


* **No asking questions about illegal firearms modifications.**

Who defines what is illegal? What country's laws shall apply? US law? What state? New York? New JerseySince when is information illegal? This isn't communist china last I checked. There are plenty of people that post here that have the license to manufacture all types of firearms. Others may be from a country with no restrictions on modifications. If I need help installing a DIAS or cutting down the the barrel of my SBS, /r/guns would be an excellent resource because of the collective knowledge of its readers. What about a post like this:

Alright, gunnitors, the US gov't has just collapsed and has been replaced with a gun-friendly coup. What's the first mod you make to your firearm?

When information is suppressed, the people that have the information can oppress you.

**EDIT:** bellemarematt makes an excellent point. AR-15's (unless crippled) are illegal in California. Should we not discuss them? 15 rounds magazines are illegal in New York, should we ban uses who upload pictures of their Glocks? Concealed Carry is illegal in Chicago, lets delete all posts concerning CCW because somewhere, it's illegal. You can't prevent stupid, but saying ""hush now, big brother doesn't want you talking about that"" is silly. 

*But storelogix, what if we start seeing posts like ""Hey, how can I silence my pistol without buying a silencer?""*

**THAT""S ILLEGAL OMG!!**

Not necessarily. Because it might not be. Doesn't answer his goddamn question though. Why should OP have to reveal that he lives in Antarctica, he's military/law enforcement, or he lives in the middle of the woods and doesn't give a fuck? Whose authority do the mods have to say that OP is telling the truth and is legally allowed to make such a modification (*Don't worry, guys, he said hes a gov't agent/FFL, you can talk about it now, he would never lie*.) Discussion is not illegal.

There are plenty of legitimate reasons why this rule is fucking retarded. 


* **No blogspam.**

Error: Rule too vague.


In conclusion, more rules just transform regular people into rule-breakers. I pray you see the irony in this nonsense and move you get rid of these rules and let the community decide how shit rolls around here. 


**""I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it."" -Thomas Jefferson**

**EDIT:** I don't disagree with the mods authority to enforce arbitrary rules of their choosing. They have inherited the control of this subreddit, and the reddit faq grants them the ability to carve a ""niche community"" as they see fit. However, I think in our specific community, we value personal freedoms, including the freedom to potentially fuck up and the freedom to call someone out on said fucking up.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1340248592.0,,,True,t3_vbwlg,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/vbwlg/long_post_warning_im_with_presidentender_these/,

1328719956.0,692,self.guns,pgf6z,"How to buy a machine gun, suppressor, grenade, and other Title II weapons",scrubadub,955,263,399,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/pgf6z/how_to_buy_a_machine_gun_suppressor_grenade_and/,"I was looking through the FAQ and couldn't find anything related to this, and one of my recent comments seemed to be upvoted enough to verify interest. I constantly see people incorrectly calling guns ""class 3"" or saying you need some kind of license, so I'm going to educate your ass.

Back in 1934 congress passed the [National Firearms Act (NFA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act). This regulated a  few types of weapons including; [machine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_guns), [short-barreled rifles (SBR)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-barreled_rifle), [short-barreled shotguns (SBS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawed-off_shotgun), [suppressors aka silencers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor), [destructive devices (DD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructive_device), and [any other weapons (AOW)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons#Any_Other_Weapon) which is a kind of catch-all for other weapons they wanted to regulate. All weapons that fall into one of these categories are considered [Title II weapons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons). Any weapons that don't fall under the NFA but do fall under the [gun control act of 1968](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act) are considered title I weapons due to them being Title I of the U.S. federal firearms laws.

To transfer Title II weapons you usually go to someone who holds a [Federal Firearms License (FFL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License) AND holds a [Special Occupational Tax (SOT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License#Special_Occupational_Tax_Classes). This is where the misconception of ""Class 3"" came from. The FFL that you transfer the title II weapon through usually has a Class 1, 2, or 3 SOT, and they typically hold a class 3 SOT. The weapon you wish to transfer must also be legal in your state. State NFA laws make no sense, some allow machine guns (with any barrel length) but not SBRs. CA still allows AOWs I believe but not SBSs, so you have to do your own research here. Before a transfer of a title II weapon can take place, the ATF must approve it, even if it is between two FFLs. The most common forms an individual would be familiar with is form 1, 3, and 4. 

A [form 3](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-3.pdf) is used between two FFLs with an SOT, and is tax free (no payment to the ATF is made). The ballpark time frame on this is around 3-4 weeks. If you purchase a suppressor out of state, you would pay the person, and if they are a FFL/SOT they would fill out a form 3 with your receiving FFL/SOT's information. Once approved they would ship it to your FFL/SOT. 

A [form 4](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf) is used as a transfer to/from an individual, corporation, or trust (all non FFL/SOTs, meaning you!). Continuing the above example your FFL/SOT receives the suppressor and will give you two copies of a form 4 with some of the information filled out. You complete anything they are missing, sign it, and include $200 to transfer anything except AOWs, they are $5. This price has been the same since 1934 when the NFA passed. If you are transferring it individually you (currently) must also include a picture, fingerprints, a local chief law enforcement officer sign off, and a [922g](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-20.pdf). A corporation or trust transfer does not require a picture, nor fingerprints, nor LEO sign off, nor 922g. This process takes somewhere around 7 months [and growing](http://www.nfatracker.com/). Once approved you can take your toy home after a standard [4473](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_4473) that all guns require. 

A [form 1](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf) is used to manufacturer a title II weapon. Typically this is used for SBRs and SBSs, since slapping on a new barrel is so easy. The process is similar to a form 4 except a FFL/SOT does not have to be involved. You as an individual, corporation, or trust fill out the form 1, include the necessary information (fingerprint, photo, LEO sign off, and 922g if doing it individually), and pay the ATF $200 (even for AOWs). After waiting the 7ish months you should get your approved form back and you can make the title II weapon. Note: there are also engraving requirements for your name (or trust, or corp name) and city, state on the weapon. 

Private sales of some title II weapons are legal in some states, in that case a FFL/SOT is not required at all, but an approved form 4 would be necessary.

After you have your title II weapon with your approved stamp there are a few differences in how you can use it over regular guns. First it is recommended that you always carry a copy of your approved form. Technically/legally you only have to show this to an ATF officer, but we all know police officers aren't legal scholars and showing them an approved ATF form calms them down. Some states even take the stance that title II weapons are illegal, and it is a defense if you have an approved form. Second, you can not take title II weapons out of state without approval (except for AOWs and suppressors). To get approval you need to fill out a [5320.20](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-20.pdf). The ATF turns these around very quickly, inside 2-3 weeks in my experience. They will only approve 5320.20's for a date range of 1 year, so you have to put in one for each state each year if you wish to travel with them. Third, you ""must"" [report any lost or stolen NFA weapons](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action;jsessionid=b332b3b5fdff8c4a6529b5d6a34e82f87a4b3373f0c339cf3d70963b16fbcc6b.e38NbxuQaNiKbi0LchmOc3eNb3v0?browsePath=Title+27%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+M%2FPart+179%2FSubpart+J%2FSection+179.141&amp;granuleId=CFR-2002-title27-vol1-sec179-141&amp;packageId=CFR-2002-title27-vol1&amp;collapse=true&amp;fromBrowse=true), though it doesn't seem like there are any penalties. And lastly you can't loan any title II weapons to anyone. If you transferred it via a corporation or trust anyone on the trust or corporation can posses it. This doesn't mean others cant shoot it, but you have to be there. Also you do not give up any 4th amendment protections, if the ATF came to your door you could tell them to fuck off and get a warrant if you wanted to, though I wouldn't recommend that phrasing. This rumor probably came from if you have a FFL/SOT, then the ATF can conduct inspections at the business, which if it is your home, then they will come to your home.

Cool I have $200 for the tax and a few hundred for a machine gun, where can I buy one? In 1986 congress passed the [Firearm Owners Protection Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act#Machine_Gun_Ban:_The_Hughes_Amendment) making it illegal to have any new machine guns be registered after May 19th 1986 (you can still buy/sell ones that were registered). This cut off supply and the price skyrocketed for all machine guns. The price isn't so much set based on the quality of the gun, but based on the rarity (supply and demand). There are some [pricing charts](http://www.machinegunpriceguide.com/) that give you an idea of how much they cost, the entry point is usually a Mac-10 at 3-4k currently. M16's run 11-19k, and belt feds will get up to 60k+. Some popular boards for NFA items are [subguns](http://subguns.com/boards/) and [sturmgewehr.com](http://www.sturmgewehr.com/webBBS/nfa4sale.cgi). This price insanity only applies to machine guns, suppressors and other title II weapons can still be made so they aren't too overpriced. 

So why do people use a trust? The primary reason is to avoid the LEO sign off, though recently the [nfatca](http://www.nfatca.org/) and others have said that the ATF is ""close"" to removing the LEO sign off for individuals. A secondary benefit is because they are modifiable, you can bring on and off people to your trust. So if you have a group of friends or family that you want to be able to use your title II weapons they could if they are on the trust, and you wouldn't have to officially transfer the weapon through the ATF. People claim (mainly lawyers) that you shouldn't draft your own trust using quicken or other tools. If there is a problem with your trust down the road you would be in violation of federal firearm regulations, though you can modify the trust at that point. My trust cost $500 from a lawyer, and I got to talk to him for 2 hours on many different firearm topics, and he also continues to answer my few questions by email when I have them. Considering I plan on putting $10k+ of weapons into my trust it was worth the $500 to me to not have any problems with the ATF. 

Other forms if you are interested; [form 0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iEeMJgV75nQ#t=53s) transfer for native american reservations [form 2](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-2.pdf) manufactured or imported, [form 5](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-5.pdf) tax exempt transfer to heir, unserviceable weapon, or to/from gov, [form 6a](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-3c.pdf) imported firearms, [form 9](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-9.pdf) permanent export of firearms. [form 10](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-10.pdf) for government entities.

Pre-sample and post-sample refer to pre/post 1986 machine gun dealer samples. Today pre/post samples can only be transferred between FFL/SOTs or Police which is why they are so cheap. FFLs with SOTs (class 2) can also make their own new machine guns, and they would be classified as post samples. FFL/SOTs can transfer post samples between each other, but they require a LEO sign off, unless the selling FFL/SOT is going out of business. In that case all post samples must be sold/destroyed immediately, though pre-samples can kept by the former FFL (But they can't transfer it to other individuals).

The average weight for women the same age group is 164.3 (all of these height statistics are from last year, the weight stats are older, so they could be off).

I’m 5’2, 105lbs. For perspective, my 11 year old brother is as tall and slightly heavier than I. And while I’m athletic, I most likely could not fight off an average sized male, or even a slightly above average female, simply due to size (I’ve actually gotten in physical altercations with my larger but younger sister when we were kids, and this is true in my experience).

But remember. I’ve been shooting since I was 4.

And I’m a damned good shot.

I’ve been mugged. I’ve been raped, I’ve been beaten, I’ve been attacked. I finally decided one day I was done with it, and started open carrying. I have not been assaulted since. Having a gun on my hip scares away people who would want to do me harm- and if someone attempted to go after me again, I would not hesitate to pull the trigger. I tend to like animals more than I like people, and I grew up hunting. So even though later on, I would feel bad about it, and probably shed a few tears, I would not regret pulling the trigger because I *refuse to ever be a victim again.*

EDIT: Yes, I know a CCW would be best. But I cannot have a CCW due to age restriction. ",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1343588356.0,,,True,t3_xcdyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/xcdyy/why_i_open_carry/,

Shooting can be a lot of fun, and a good gun in well-trained hands is one of the best self-defense tools around.  

**You're probably thinking about hardware right now**.  Lucky for you, there are already [many](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/118keg/this_is_a_list_of_the_guns_you_should_get_no_no/), [many](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/eeb3c/this_is_a_guide_to_choosing_your_first_pistol/), *[many](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/wiki/faq)* discussions about good first guns (which you no doubt found when you read [the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/wiki/faq)), and I've even written [one of my own](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1ibkog/how_to_choose_your_first_handgun/).

Finding your perfect firearm is fun and interesting, and is an important step in the process, but *there's a lot more to responsible gun ownership than just picking out a gun!*  

Let's talk about the other considerations that are often ignored in these ""First time buyer"" threads, and that often cause new gun-owners pain and unexpected expense:

1) **Safety**.

Know the [basics of gun safety](http://training.nra.org/nra-gun-safety-rules.aspx) before you walk into a gun store to even look.  Once you're there, treat every gun in the place as if it were loaded, always point it in a safe direction, and keep your finger off the trigger unless you're ready to shoot.  If the employees aren't doing the same, find a new store.

2) **Think about the rest of your personal security first**

First, realize that a gun is not a magic talisman.  Just owning a gun won't make you safer, and if you're actually forced to use it, even in the most clear-cut self-defense imaginable, *severely injuring or killing another human being is going to mess with your life*.  Legally, emotionally, and financially, if you have to defend yourself with deadly force, right or wrong, you're not going to enjoy the fallout, and that's assuming you come out alive and relatively intact.  So you need to look around at other parts of your life that make that exceptionally crappy situation more likely.

If you need a gun because you're moving to a crappy neighborhood, don't move there, or at least spend some cash on [window bars and reinforced door jambs](http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/homesecurity.html).  If you're being stalked or threatened, get the cops involved too, document it.  If you're banging a heavily armed biker's wife/husband/mom, well, stop. 

Buying a gun while ignoring other risks in your personal security plan is like having a diet soda with your triple-decker burger and chili-fries.  Sure, having a gun (with the proper training to use it) will increase your personal safety, but do everything else you can to ensure you never have to use it.

3) **Be honest with yourself about how you'll be using the gun**

First, you've gotta figure out why you're in the market, and be honest with the answer.  The right gun for home defense is different than the right gun for fending off polar bears, and those are both different than the right guns for putting holes in distant paper (or distant deer) on a Saturday afternoon.  The right gun for carry in Minneapolis winters is the wrong gun for carry in Miami summers.  There's nothing wrong with any reason you have (even ""because they're fun!""), but don't whip yourself up in fear of polar bears when you really want a gun for Miami-carry, and don't buy a super-compact carry gun if you're north of the Arctic circle.

4) **Learn the laws and rules at the federal, state, local, and really local levels**

Every country, state, county, and city has laws, and the interactions between them can be even more complicated, especially for carry.  Learn them for where you live, work, and travel often.  [Handgunlaw.us](http://handgunlaw.us) will get you started, but it's no substitute for talking to a lawyer specializing in gun and concealed carry law about the oddities of your particular jurisdiction(s).

Equally importantly, think about the rules and regulations that are specific to your life.  Does your apartment/condo complex ban guns in residences?  How about your employer?  Will your insurance company cover gun theft?  How about liability with regards to gun accidents?  

Even think about *really* local issues.  There's no shortage of posts on here along the lines of ""My girlfriend/boyfriend/roommate/cat said they'd move out if I buy a gun, what do I do?"".  This is not a conversation to have while your safe is being delivered.  

5) **Get enough training to be more of a danger to bad guys than you are to yourself**

If you've never really shot guns, or you've only shot your granddad's replica muzzle-loaders, it's worth a few hundred dollars to get some training with a real instructor.  A good course will cover safety, mechanics of guns and ammo, basics of shooting, basic laws in your area, and ideally, maintenance and cleaning.  Most also have a live-fire portion so you can shoot, and more importantly, so you can shoot with an instructor who can point out your own individual issues with marksmanship.  Most will let you rent or borrow a gun for the course so that you can start your training before you've made a purchase.

Many states require training to apply for a concealed carry permit, but keep taking courses and practicing well beyond that limit.  If you're only an ""OK"" shot at the range, you'll likely be a mess when Freddy McPolarBear is chasing you across the tundra (or in any other self-defense situation).  Remember, a gun is not a magical talisman, it is a tool for *you* to use to keep yourself safe, and *you* need training to use it well.

Finally, even if you're already a Navy Delta Ranger Tactical SIGINT SEAL SWAT Operator, your husband/wife/BF/GF/BFF/roommate/SO/cat should get some training too to learn to safely handle and use your home defense weapon.  Even if they show no interest at all in guns and ""couldn't possibly use one for defense"", they at least need to know how to safely move, unload and secure the weapon without you present, for that one day you leave it on the bedside table and they've got to dust.  As an aside, that knowledge alone might make spark a bit more interest and address some of the issues in #4.

6) **How are you going to keep your gun(s) safe?**

As you're shopping around for your gun, include the cost of a safe place to keep your guns.  Your needs will vary.  Actual, secure gun safes are expensive.  ""Security Cabinets"" are less so.  A locking closet door, less still.  Some areas have laws (see #4) about how you can store guns, make sure your plan jives with them.

If you've just bought a pistol, you may want one of those quick-access boxes.  [Many of them are easily defeated](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJFQO4DIxw). With these, remember to think about the ""Backup"" method of opening when you're considering safes, as that's usually easier to attack than the keypad.  If it's got a [tubular lock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubular_pin_tumbler_lock) as a backup access method, you can likely do better, as they're easily picked with basic tools.  Go to a few lock shops in your city to see what they recommend (as they tend to have more secure options than gun stores).  Secure quick-access boxes can be had for the same price as cheap ones, you just have to look harder.  $150-200 is not unreasonable for a secure quick safe, and remember that unless you've bolted it down to something, it doesn't need to be opened to be stolen.

Again, think about your needs.  If you're just trying to keep your toddler out, that's one thing, but if you've got teenagers, roommates, or criminals around, you might want to spend the money when you can.  And if you live alone (or with a trusted spouse), in a safe neighborhood, and the rest of your security is good, well, a bedside cabinet or book safe may be good enough.  But think about how much security you need, and whether each solution will provide it.

7) **Can you take care of it?**

You'll need to clean your gun.  Some tolerate more dirt than others before failing, but a day at the range takes even the nicest gun from pristine to dirty, and if you're going to rely on your firearm, everything you can do to keep it reliable and in good condition is time well spent.  Your training course (you did take one, right?) should cover the how-to of cleaning, and your local gun store (or YouTube) can show you how to break down whatever you buy, but expect to spend $50 or so on basic cleaning supplies for a handgun, likely more for rifles.  Also, /r/guncleaning.

8) **Can you feed it?**

Ammo is not cheap, and can be hard to find (at the moment, at least).  But you'll need to practice, and practice needs ammo.  So, expect to spend another $200-300 on the ammo it'll take to get proficient, more so if you're shooting a huge, rare or obscure caliber.  

Also, realize that you'll spend more on defensive ammunition than practice ammo, and that you'll want to know the difference.  But it's OK, because they talked about that in that class you took (see #5).

9) **Where can you shoot it?**

Few are lucky enough to have large amounts of safe land and tolerant neighbors, such that they can shoot at home.  Gun ranges aren't terribly uncommon in most places, but know where your closest ranges or places to shoot are, *and then call to see if members of the public can shoot there*.  My nearest 2 ranges are members-only, with 2 and 4.5 year waiting lists, respectively, so despite living on the edges of a major metropolitan area, I drive around 45 minutes to shoot at a place I like.  It's also worth Googling or checking Yelp when you're looking at ranges, because that's where you'll find out about the bad ventilation, sketchy customers, and/or crazy owners.  

If your only range is too far, expensive, or trashy for you to practice effectively, that's something you need to know now before you end up with a $500 tool you can't learn to use.

One other thing to keep in mind is that you need to wear eye and ear protection *every time you shoot*.  Most ranges have it free to rent, but if you shoot someplace that doesn't (or if you want to wear both plugs and earmuffs, get electronic earmuffs, etc), you'll need to bring (and buy) your own, around $50.  Remember, *every gunshot you hear unprotected permanently robs you of some of your hearing, and you cannot get it back*.

10) **How much will this really cost?**

There's a lot more to buying your first gun than walking into a store and plunking down cash for hardware, and even if the gun you're looking at is only $500, you'll also need be paying for:

* Governmental Costs (Background Checks, Licenses, FFL fees, Sales Tax)
* Training
* Cleaning Supplies
* Gun Safe/Quick Access Box
* Defensive Ammo
* Practice Ammo
* Range Fees for your first outing (if it's not part of your training)
* Eye and Ear Protection
* Other accessories (like holsters, extra magazines, a decent case, snap-caps for practice at home)

These things together can easily cost $400-500 on top of the price of your weapon of choice.  Luckily, many of them are one-time costs, and won't be repeated for future purchases, but you need to know that these expenses are there before you plug the price of your favorite gun into the ""Becoming Armed"" category in this month's budget and think you're done.

**OK, *now* go buy a gun!**

Shooting is a lot of fun, and in a terrible situation in which a gun is necessary for defense, it's an excellent thing to have around.  Just think long and hard about these issues, questions, and expenses, and realize that there's a lot more to buying a gun than running into your local gun store with a wad of cash and a clean background check.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1373868033.0,,,True,t3_1hrh0y,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1hrh0y/so_youre_going_to_buy_your_first_gun/,

1329324708.0,650,self.guns,pqvfz,My state senator is sponsoring a bill to outlaw concealed carry on college campuses (WA state). Here's the email I sent to her.,FreedomsTorch,948,298,270,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/pqvfz/my_state_senator_is_sponsoring_a_bill_to_outlaw/,"[WA SB 5592](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=5592) - Concerning weapons in or on the premises of an institution of higher education, or at a college-sponsored event.

I don't see much chance of this bill passing, but I still thought I should give my two cents.

&gt;Senator,

&gt;I am disheartened to see you're a sponsor of SB5592. I'm hopeful your intention is to prevent violence and harm to your constituents and all citizens in our great state, and I of course desire the same. I find the bill will do little, if anything, to prevent violence on college campuses and at associated events, while simultaneously preventing otherwise law-abiding citizens from effectively defending themselves simply because they're on a campus.

&gt;It is particularly concerning that you and the other sponsors are not only attempting to prevent otherwise lawful carry of firearms, but that you have gone to the trouble of specifically exempting RCW 9.41.270.3c (self-defense clause). One can only infer an intent to deprive law-abiding citizens from fully exercising their natural right to defend themselves.

&gt;Obviously you believe this is necessary and wouldn't presume to violate such rights without a highly justifiable cause. Perhaps you believe that criminals, who by definition break laws, will for some reason follow this law. Perhaps you believe that lawful carriers of firearms are more of a threat to safety than criminals, though I must admit this belies ordinary logic and would ask that you proffer evidence of such. Maybe there is an epidemic of gun violence at Washington colleges of which I'm unaware. Is there something magical about the campus of a college that makes it a bad place to legally carry a weapon as opposed to the areas in its immediate vicinity? A clarification as to the necessity for this law would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;One must also consider the unintended consequences. Since this is not a trait which politicians are known for, I'll give it my best shot. As well-established research has shown, those with concealed weapons permits are far more law-abiding on average than citizens who do not have permits. Some studies have even shown lesser criminality than police officers. With that in mind, we can assume that carriers with permits will likely disarm themselves voluntarily and follow your new law should it pass.

&gt;This presents multiple problems. First, if one travels to the campus by public transportation, they will have no safe place to store their weapon prior to entering the campus and will have no alternative but to disarm themselves for the entirety of both legs of their journey. For many people, this could mean multiple bus rides with connecting points at transit terminals that are, to say the least, some of the more crime intensive locations. I wouldn't want to be a small female at the Downtown Seattle bus terminal at 11PM by myself and disarmed. I suggest you try it sometime if you don't believe me.

&gt;Another problem is that those who drive their own vehicle will likely store their weapon in their vehicle. I'm not sure if you're aware, but the vast majority of firearms possessed by criminals and used in the commission of crimes are stolen. Furthermore, many stolen weapons, if not the majority, are a result of theft from vehicles. As car burglary is far more prevalent than home burglary, it is an entirely foreseeable conclusion that passage of this law will increase the number of stolen firearms in black market circulation. Thieves looking for guns will know that the parking areas around college campuses will be more likely to yield a firearm, and they will certainly exploit this knowledge for full effect. In other words, this will undoubtedly lead to more gun violence. 

&gt;Most importantly, the passage of this law would be a bright neon sign to a potential spree killer to the effect of ""The people in this place cannot fight back"". Disturbed individuals like Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech spree killer, would be effectively put on notice that college campuses in Washington are a great place to commit their heinous crimes. He certainly wasn't deterred by their no-guns policy.

&gt;Perhaps I'm wrong and there's something I missed. I look forward to your reply.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,t3_pqvfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/pqvfz/my_state_senator_is_sponsoring_a_bill_to_outlaw/,

**www.Miculek.com**

It is still under some construction, so bear with us as we attempt to get some of the kinks worked out. Eventually the site will be populated with product reviews, shooting tips, and how-to's.
_______________________________________________________

Let he who is strong and brave enough ***dare*** to interfere with my personal time. Let his questions not be weak, but strong and to the point!

Ask me anything!

***The top 10 upvoted questions will be getting a video response from me tomorrow.***

**Edit: Thank you for all the questions! We will be working hard to get out some video responses out today so keep an eye out for the followup post.**",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1357504465.0,,,True,t3_16151q,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/16151q/i_am_jerry_miculek_professional_shooter_multitime/,

I get a call from his son. He wants to get it for him for fathers day! 

So he comes down, does the 4473 and plops down $700 on my desk. 

""Um. This gun is $1000. You want me to just put this as a deposit down and  when you get the other $300, I'll let this fly?""

EDIT:

Text in case you don't want to load the image:

 We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.
Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.",MOD APPROVED,False,,t5_2qhc8,1361928730.0,,,True,t3_19anwj,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/19anwj/magpul_announcement_for_colorado_residents/,

The deal was that my Dad had sold all his guns when we were kids in order to put food on the table. He's been missing having one, so we wanted to remedy it, but were on a budget. 

We were able to get the money together and went with an [American Tactical](http://www.americantactical.us/940/detail.html) 1911 .45 caliber.  

On Christmas morning, we had put it down inside several boxes and it took him almost 10 minutes to get into it. He opened the box and his eyes teared up just a little. 

He got really quiet and said ""It's been a long time..."" The grin on his face as he turned it over and looked at it had me absolutely ready to burst into tears. 

So then he got to unwrap the ammo (we got him 100 rounds), and then my brother's girlfriend was able to get a hold of some targets (her dad is a cop). 

He promptly put on his shoes and went outside and shot it several times. It was amazing. My dad, my husband, my brother, and my future brother-in-law were all outside shooting the gun. I couldn't have been happier.

The next day my Dad finally got to teach me how to fire a weapon. I'll admit, I screamed at it after I fired it because it startled me. I was a total girl about it. 

My Dad hasn't let the gun leave his sight. He carried it around the house. He was holding it while he sat on the couch, he brought it to the dinner table, he cleaned it several times, and he started browsing for accessories  for it. 

I know I didn't go with what you folks suggested, but hearing from you all made it easier for me to walk into a gun store and get Dad the best Christmas present ever. 

TLDR: r/guns made me confident enough to go to the gun store and buy my dad a gun for Christmas. He flipping loved it. Thanks, guys! 

EDIT: A brief [album of Dad opening the gun](http://imgur.com/a/7QFBT), but still no pictures of him with the gun. The look on his face is nice though! 

And since you guys will wonder, my Dad is 45, but he looks a whole lot younger. I'm 23, my sister is 21 and my brother is 17. ",,False,,t5_2qhc8,1356896353.0,,,True,t3_15njp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/15njp8/update_heres_the_gun_we_bought_dad_for_christmas/,

I do that on other subreddits!  (Unless you guys really want to argue politics?  But I'd rather no one get all pissed off, me included.)

But yeah.  I love guns.  I've only got one (an XDm bought last week after a lot of gunnit's advice!), but I've always thought that anyone who can be trusted with a gun should have a gun, and that people should have a right to buy, own, and carry firearms.  

I am for *some* gun control.  I think a basic background check makes sense, to make sure you don't have a history of schizophrenia or gun-related crime.  Remember, a *lot* of gun laws, especially local ordinances and such, are common sense; stuff that no one in their right mind would do anyway.  (Setting up firing ranges next to elementary schools, stuff like that.)  But for the most part, I'm against the more severe forms of gun control.  I think it's a shame that there are places where people can't carry, or even own, a firearm.  That bothers me intrinsically.

But almost all of my other politics are pretty left wing.  Ten years ago I would have called myself a moderate, but it seems like the whole spectrum is moving so far to the right that now I'm some sort of left wing extremist!  I didn't change many of my views, but things that used to be moderate are not crazy left wing.  I'm *very much* for socialized health care, I'm for better funded schools, I'm usually pro-union (depends on the union), I'm basically pro-choice, and I'm anti-corporate.  I'm for progress, I'm for science, I'm for the separation of church and state.  (I'm *not* anti-religious, at all.  I love religion.  But putting ""IN GOD WE TRUST"" on the side of all our Federal buildings is just offensive, and it bothers the hell out of me that some politicians have proposed it.)  

If this means higher taxes, then bring 'em on.  Just make sure that the top 5% is just as burdened as I am.  

And that's where I end up having problems.  I want to vote for politicians that are against gun control, but most of them are Republican!  And as much as I think it's vital that we are allowed to own our own weapons, I can't put that over the health and safety of our less fortunate.  I can't sacrifice the middle class to corporate greed just so it's easier to own guns.  (Though I think in the long term, my views line up.  If a corporation ever completely purchases a state and converts it to private property, then that population can kiss any consitutional rights they had goodbye.)

So any other liberals here?  How do you make your decisions?  

Like I said, I don't intend for this to be an argument.  I'm fine with discussing things, but I'm not trying to be inflammatory.  Just describing my views on things.  I figured that Reddit is generally so left-leaning that I'd have at least a chance of finding some others with my POV.

The JTFOC will no longer sell prohibited items to law enforcement agencies or any government agencies in states, counties, cities, and municipalities that have enacted restrictive gun control laws against their law abiding citizens. We hope other companies will join us with their support. We applaud those already involved with this effort to protect our 2nd Amendment rights.

(Album inside.),moving0target,750,168,235,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/rezzc/my_fathers_sidearm_while_he_was_in_vietnam_album/,"Since they wouldn't issue sidearms to grunts, my father had a friend in the States mail him a replica 1858 Army .44 cap and ball revolver.  He carried it for 10 of the 12 months he was in country.  On two separate occasions, it meant the difference between life and death.

When last I mentioned this story, someone asked how he kept it operating in damp conditions.  He would put Vaseline over each chamber.  To keep the caps dry, he would crimp them onto the nipples.  Apparently he never had a misfire.

He carried it for a month before the captain made him lock it in the armory since it wasn't an issued weapon.  Roughly a month later, a new captain came in who was more worried about keeping his men alive so pop got his .44 back.  Top sergeant used to harass him about using a weapon that was banned by the Geneva Convention.  Oddly enough, they had a surprise inspection from a brigadier general right after they got back from the boonies. (Edit: Left out the best bit.)  When the general noticed the revolver, he asked if it was Army issue.  ""Yes!"" Dad answered, ""In 1858.""  He also commented on the revolver and expressed the same concerns.  ""But, sir,"" interjected their lieutenant, ""he's already used it in combat.""  General didn't say another word and their squad actually got a commendation for that inspection.

Edit: Taking cell phone pictures of 40 year old pictures doesn't yield very good results.  Please excuse the quality.

Edit II: Hague Convention rather than the Geneva Convention bans deforming slugs.  I tell the story as it was told to me, though.

Edit da third: Here I am atop Gunnit.  Can't thing of a better place to be and I'm glad everyone has enjoyed the pictures and stories.

FINAL EDIT: Glad the morning crew and day crew enjoy this just as much.  I'm blown away by how much Gunnit enjoyed this and I'm sure my father will get a kick out of it, too.  As for the pics, as soon as I can, I'll get some better scans.  Another Gunnitor has very generously offered to reprint the pic.  If I manage to make that happen, I'll be sure to share the results. Thanks again, Gunnit.

Well she's gone and upped the ante:

Around 8:00 PM last night two men broke into our house through the back window. I was away at the time and my wife thought it was me coming home. They made it as far as the dining room (just a few feet from the living room where she was sitting with our one month old daughter) when she realized what was happening and ran upstairs. 

After putting our daughter on the bed, she grabbed the Ruger SP101 (which we keep loaded and accessible for just such occasions). She then went downstairs loudly warning the thugs that she was armed and dangerous. 

Between her shouting and the sound of the first empty chamber being cleared, the thugs must have thought better of sticking around and grabbed whatever they could as they beat a hasty retreat. I have no doubt that they were seconds away from having a life ""changing"" experience.

I contend that anybody that finds the term ""Jew points"" offensive is in fact an anti-Semite. Jew points are a good thing, and if you don't like Jew points that makes you a Jew-hater, which I cannot abide.

I demand that the person that reported my comment come forth identify themselves so that I may challenge them to a pistol duel in order to restore said honor:

Hi /r/guns - I was hoping you could help me out.

I've been pretty anti-gun (for purposes other than hunting and law enforcement) for as long as I can remember.  I honestly can't imagine many scenarios where I think they would improve a situation - recently I had someone show up to a party my friend was hosting with a sidearm on his hip and it made me *wildly* uncomfortable.

**However**, any other issue I disagree with I have attempted to immerse myself in the opposite view for some perspective - if your views can't stand their ground vs opposition, then they are useless.  For some reason I have never really done this with my long-held opinion on gun ownership and gun control issues.

The problem is I don't really know how to go about broadening my view in this area.  Are there some good books to read?  Is it going to take me going to a shooting range and actually confronting firing a weapon?  Do I just show up at a shooting range and confess I have no idea what I'm doing and that I don't ever really want to own a gun?

I'm not here to debate people, but if there are any ""converts"" who went from despising gun ownership to accepting or embracing it, I would be interested to hear that tale.


**Edit:** I greatly appreciate all the offers from Arizona gunnit members to take me shooting, I truly wasn't expecting it.  I have contacted two members about taking them up on their offers and may move on from there, but for the mean time if I made plans to go shooting with everyone my girlfriend may think I lost my mind.  But thank you for all the offers.

**Edit2:** I should probably explain my unease with guns further.  I'm uneasy around guns in social settings (stores, parties, sporting events).  In my head it's like going running vs going running along the edge of the Grand Canyon.  It's not that the height is inherently bad or wrong, only that it adds an element of (what I consider to be unnecessary) danger to the situation.  I'm fine with the idea of walking into a shooting range because I *expect* guns to be there, and the environment is equipped to handle them.  It's not like bringing someone afraid of clowns to a circus.  I'm willing to admit that this feeling may be irrational or unfounded, but that's why I'm here.

I called Glock about replacing it and they said i could send the gun in, order the part through an armorer, or, since I live in Atlanta, I could visit their corporate headquarters in Smyrna. I went to their corporate headquarters and it was easily the best customer service experience of my life. The security guard buzzed me in to the armorer's waiting room where there were Glock periodicals and a Glock documentary on the tv. The armorer came out immediately and asked me what the trouble was and he even filled out the form for me. He was quite surprised the firing pin broke but said he would replace it right away. I waited about 30 mins while watching the documentary which was pretty interesting. When he came out he said he had replaced the firing pin as well as the trigger spring, the connector and recoil spring with updated versions. He had also test fired, cleaned, and polished the gun. Furthermore he apologized for the unusual malfunction and gave me a free hat and tee-shirt. There was  no charge. All in all it was the best customer service of my life.

1357794009.0,538,self.guns,16apth,Attempted robbery thwarted by my decision to conceal carry at work.,CaptainDan,655,117,287,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/16apth/attempted_robbery_thwarted_by_my_decision_to/,"I work for a smoke shop in my town. We have our share of shady customers. In the seven years we've been open, we've had a fair amount of theft and runners, but never an actual robbery attempt. Every manager that works at my store is required to carry, and since I live in Arizona, I carry concealed.

Last night what no clerk wants to happen, happened. 

About 6:00pm or so I was sitting in the back office eating my dinner. My fellow manager was in the back with me, and two clerks were up front. Some jackass came in with a ski mask, gloves, and a duffel bag. We didn't notice at first, he was being very calm and telling the clerks to lock the door and open the register. Never being in that situation before, they both sorta just froze. 

He must've been in the store for all of 30 seconds before my fellow  manager looks up at our security monitor and notices something wrong up front. Now, normally I carry inside the waist in the small of my back. When I eat I remove my firearm and lay it on the desk in the holster right next to the security monitor. My other manager usually carries a revolver in a pocket holster, but didn't bring it in that day.

So, he sees this guy trying to open the register and immediately says to me "" I think we're being robbed!"" and grabs my XDS and chambers a round (I carry it loaded, but he didn't know that). He goes out to the front of the store and sorta flanks around a few cases trying to keep some barricade between him and the robber. He draws on the guy and tells him that he will drop him if he doesn't freeze. 

The guy seems confused at first, so my fellow manager tells him again that if he doesn't stop what he's doing he is going to shoot him. Finally the guy turns around, realizes my .45 is pointed at his head. He does a little jerk and throws his hands up and bolts out the door. 

Cops show up in 5 minutes, but he's long gone. Probably went back to whatever hole he crawled out of and shit himself. Hopefully he learned a valuable lesson and will think twice next time. 

This was my first robbery attempt in 15 years of working retail, Still kinda shook up. I'm thankful for my right to carry and I'm thankful for the quick actions of my other manager and thankful that he took the az ccw class and knew how to properly handle the situation.

At least, I have a video clip of some dipshit wannabe robber shitting himself!

Here's why.",etherfrolic,813,275,353,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/nrs30/got_a_gun_for_christmas_although_ive_never_been/,"Hi. I don't come from a place where firearms use is a way of life or anything. I grew up in the city. Texas, yes, but not out in the country. Never fired a gun, never really thought about it. Yes, I firmly support the right to bear arms, but that's about as much thought as I had given the issue.

This Christmas, I unwrapped a matte black Remington shotgun. At first I was shocked, even confused... then I picked it up and held it in my hands... and felt something I had never felt before. Though I'd never cared about guns, I thought it looked beautiful. I thought it felt really good, really *right* in my hands, and all of a sudden it struck me: this is *my* gun. *My* gun. And I just burst into tears, and I just couldn't stop saying, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you....

Although I am a 22 year old woman, I weigh around 90 lbs and measure about 5 ft. I have had trouble keeping weight on my whole life, and always suffered chronic fatigue and weakness. As a kid I got picked on a lot, and I could never fight back, and it led to crippling social anxiety. When I was 7 I was held down and molested, and that same year had to run from a man who had a knife one night who was pursuing my mom and I. As a woman I had to hide from my emotionally abusive boyfriend (now ex) on the regular for two years, never wanting to say something that would upset him because there was no telling what he would do the next time he kicked in my door or shattered a window. I've been raped.

But holding that gun, I could suddenly feel years of fear lifting. I realized that I *don't have to be scared* at night, when I hear noises. The gun fits perfectly in my arms - it's small, barely above the 18-in limit. Light. Smooth trigger, smooth pump. I know this probably isn't true, but it's as if whoever designed it thought of people like me. People who struggle with opening jars and reaching things on the fridge, people who wince away in fear if they pass a large man on the street.

Oh my God... I don't have to be afraid at night anymore. Oh my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. God Bless America.

**tl;dr:** My whole life I have felt and believed I am weak and powerless to stop people from hurting me. Now that I have been given a weapon that is *mine*, an equalizer, I suddenly understand what all y'all gun enthusiasts are talking about. So... rock on, you guys.


**edit:** WOW, I didn't expect so many replies! (I am new to reddit.) Thank you for your kind words, and I will finish responding later today. I realize that the tone of this post was very emotional, but please understand that this brought up a lot of stuff for me. However, despite that, I DO respect the seriousness that a deadly weapon entails. I do intend to practice, and I am taking lessons from my mom's boyfriend, who used to make a living training cops. I am committed to making the habits of firearms safety (not pointing the muzzle at anything you don't intend to destroy, not touching the trigger, etc) part of my *motor memory*. Anyway, thank you for the kind words, and even for the critical ones too.

I decided to post my personal defense rifle and why I decided to go with certain options. Keep in mind these are all opinions and only you can decide what works for you. I'm pretty dismissive of ""You have to get part ""X"" for your rifle and brand ""Y"" cause it's so operatorlolz"". I am pretty certain that a rifle you intend to defend yourself with needs a couple of items (Light, sling, backup sights, etc.) but you have to choose which one's will work in your situation.
Keep in mind when I say ""fighting rifle"" I don't mean ""end of the world Mad Max keep the hoards away"" I'm talking about a rifle I will use to defend my life.

Edit: I put together a parts list and what I paid for each item at the time. That doesn't mean that's what it costs now. Also, thanks for all the compliments.

1375187911.0,533,self.guns,1jcf0u,Armslist Woes: A Gun-Purchase Thankfully Aborted,Caedus_Vao,657,124,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1jcf0u/armslist_woes_a_gunpurchase_thankfully_aborted/,"I don't normally self-post to bitch, but I thought last night's adventure would be appreciated by you guys:

Armslist is usually my default starting point for any gun-related searches;  it's free, pretty well-populated, and there's a high turnover rate on the posts.  I've bought and sold some pretty good stuff on there, no hassle at all. I'm continually looking for Lee-Enfields, and there have been some screaming deals to be had from guys that just didn't know or care what they had, and posted it up online.  

I've got a rolling ""Want to Buy"" for Enfield stuff that I renew periodically, and I get a fair amount of response from it.  Yesterday, my inbox lights up with a poorly-spelled ad for a ""Enfielde with bayonette"".  The description looked familiar, and it turned out to be a 1943 Longbranch No. 4 Mk. I * that was up for sale in my area . A little back-and-forth revealed the following:


* bayonet came with scabbard and frog
* The gun has been shot, and of course it's very accurate and never locks up (of course).
* All the serial numbers match
* He's GOT to sell this gun
* He'll throw in 25 ""shells""
* He's local to me, living about twenty minutes away

So we agree to meet in the parking lot of a Gander Mountain after work, and I'm there at 5:30 with a pocket full of cash.  Any numbers-matching Enfield that's not a pile of shit is worth $300, and I've stumbled across some great $300 guns before. He tells me his name is ""Buck"" and he'll be there. 

....and the plot thickens. 


5:45 rolls around, Buck's fuckin' late.  I give him a text, he promises to be there soon.  Sure enough, about ten minutes later the red Chevy Blazer he described comes rolling up, but it's thumping god-awful rap and the windows are buzzing in time with the bass.  A faint whiff of shitty weed comes wafting out of the windows, and three guys jump out, sporting clown tattoos and Psychopathic Records gear. At this point, I recognize the music for what it is: Insane Clown Posse. 

....that's right.  Buck is a fucking Juggalo.   Buck the Juggalo. Juggalo Buck. 


At this point, I'm Han-Soloing the the shit out of the situation, because I've got bad feelings about this whole deal.  I squash them, shake hands, and they haul out this Longbranch to take a look at.  Right off, it's filthy, the bolt doesn't match the action, neither match the barrel, and the magazine (marked Savage actually) had no number at all.  The butt's been spliced and repaired a few times, but butt-plate is missing it's trap door, and I see a little bit of wear in the chamber, along with a big ""2"" on the bolt head, meaning that this gun's been shot a lot. 

At this point, I find out which one Juggalo Buck is, a scraggly little blonde dude standing off to the side.  NOT the guy that shook hands with me and hauled the gun out....he comes up and tells me ""yea I've shot it a few times but never cleaned it.""  *No shit, Buck*, thinks I.  I tell them right there that this gun is non-matching and a little beat.  I can't do more than $200.  Buck agrees, but first I tell him I have to check the bore.  Thank God I did, because it was blacker and more pitted than Satan's taint.  Fouling pretty much obscured the grooves, but I could see substantial pitting on the lands of the rifling.  I look up and ask him if he was shooting corrosive ammo, or cleaned this gun EVER. 

Juggalo Buck produces a ziploc bag of ammunition.  Sure as shit, it's Pakistani surplus, very corrosive stuff. After I inform him that his bore is toast, he says ""well, can't you just scrub it out or something?"" I briefly explained how rust and corrosion work, and told him that as the gun sat it would be a parts gun for me, and my offer had dropped to $125.  I was secretly hoping he'd just walk away.  


....and this is where I found out that I was flirting with a felony.  

Juggalo Buck's face falls and he's all ""Man, my mom will KILL me if I take $125 for this..."" My head cocks, I ask him just how old he is. ""Seventeen"", his reply. 

In Ohio, selling a gun to a minor is a 5th degree felony.  Buying from a minor has to be just as illegal, if not more.  At this point I throw up my hands and say ""I can't buy a gun from a minor, sorry man.  Gotta go."", and they apologetically load up their shit and thump on out of the parking lot. Had the sale actually gone through, I'd have asked to see ID before the money changed hands like always and balked then.  

I sent him a text a little later giving my assessment of his gun, what he could do to clean it up, and linked him to a few youtube videos and write-ups for dis-assembly, along with a warning that he should probably have someone 18+ sell the gun for him. He was polite and appreciative.


All's well that ends well, I suppose.  Now I'm off to go grab some Faygo Moon Mist....


**TL;DR**- Almost bought a rusty Lee-Enfield from an underage Juggalo named Buck.

So many of your anti-gun enthusiasts like to say things like, ""Yeah you can bear arms but whats wrong with only having long guns"" or ""Why do you need military style weapons"" or something of a similar nature. But like I said I googled your second amendment and it is pretty obvious that since your country was so young and new at the time of your constitutions creation it was expected that everyone would have a weapon to use against an invading force. So since modern armies have military style weapons (I know, I know no kidding eh?) you are entitled to military style weapons yourselves.

Am I missing something? It seems very strange to me that this has become such a big issue for you guys, why target the guns instead of the individuals, and isn't punishing everyone for the acts of the few already illegal under the UN charter against group punishment?

I don't know I'm sure I don't fully grasp your politics but that's just my take on things.",,False,,t5_2qhc8,False,,,True,t3_17lxem,http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/17lxem/american_2nd_amendment_rights_as_interpreted_by_a/,
