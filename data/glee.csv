The Glee cast and many fans, friends, family have suffered a huge loss. This thread has been made to talk about the loss of the very talent actor, Cory Monteith.

Us mods have talked about it, and we have agreed to set a few rules in place.

Glee has taught us many things. Love, acceptance, tolerance and how to have a good time even when things seem dark and hopeless. /r/glee should be a place exactly like that. So for the sake of his memory, any new posts about Cory will be removed.

We understand you need to talk about it, we all have a heavy heart. We understand the loss of Cory is heartbreaking.

That is why we have made this thread. Please discuss it here, and not flood /r/glee with RIP posts. Glee is a happy show, it has made us laugh, cry, cringe and at times probably made a few of us a little angry. We want /r/glee to show this, we want /r/glee to be a place of sanctuary.

We have suffered a heavy loss, but for Cory's sake, let's keep the discussions to this thread.

Thank you for understanding, from all of the mod team.",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_1ib058,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1ib058/mod_post_please_read_the_official_cory_monteith/,moderator

The new kids are too perfect. Marley is sweet and is bullied and is poor and has odd clothes. There's nothing wrong with her personality, other than her bout with an eating disorder caused by bullying. She's beautiful, in a beyond ideal perfect highschool relationship, has a glorious voice, and is charming, shy and cute. 

Cut back to season one, Rachel is absolutely obnoxious. She is obsessive, shrill, talks incessantly, and is constantly over judging her greatness, an isn't a current standard of beauty. She doesn't get the guy. She does and then smothers him. She falls into social traps laid by those more cunning. And it's all her fault. And we love her for it. 

Jake: super cute, okay home life, off but supportive brother, fights for the girl and although he's a little dense in knowing what Marley wants, he's perfect. He got over his anger problems and now addresses social concerns perfectly and always comes around in the end. He was Noah done right. 

Noah still makes me cringe, between college life and getting Finn in line, you never really know what approach he'll take. 

In the old seasons there were times where you crinkled your nose in disgust/annoyance because your beloved character misjudged and chose incorrectly. Now, each person is characterized by something beyond their control, and gracefully recovers from the momentary setback.

1373940072.0,111,self.glee,1idtkv,**[OFFICIAL] Cory Monteith Rumors**,aggfan9,125,14,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1idtkv/official_cory_monteith_rumors/,"I thought I'd make a master thread for these since there's so many going around. There were a few that I wanted to address up front that I know for a fact aren't true. Please, please, please feel free to add any questions or confirmed rumors. I want to make this hard time on Lea, his family and friends peaceful and without much negative interference from us. Spreading some of these rumors would not help the grieving process in any way.
Let's get started-

**Rumor #1:** A popular rumor is that this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPKHemTCEAEHvyQ.jpg) is of Lea Michele grieving over Cory Monteith's casket. Although it seems like it could be legit considering the similarities in the woman shown and Lea's appearance, there are multiple things wrong with this photo. One, Cory's Canadian - not American. There is no reason for there to be an American flag draping his casket considering he is Canadian and never served in the U.S. military. This picture is was also surfaced hours after the death of Monteith was reported. I'm sure Cory's body isn't even in a casket yet due to the tests being performed to figure out the cause. Lastly, it was confirmed that this picture was featured in a [news article](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPJ11zkCMAEWj79.jpg) mid 2012 featuring the wife of a fallen soldier.

**Rumor #2:** Another rumor going around is that ""Lea and Cory were supposed to get married in two weeks"" -- usually attached to this [picture.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPKRNXnCYAACjoe.jpg) There were reports released after Cory last got out of rehab that they had a future planned together, however, there are no confirmations that they were engaged or ""getting married in two weeks."" The picture that the statement is typically attached to is definitely shopped. For one, the colors on the card don't match up exactly. Also, that picture was taken at an awards show in 2010 before they had started dating.

**Rumor #3:** There is a rumor going around on Twitter that this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPIBgRcCIAAJ4Tq.jpg) (WARNING. THIS PICTURE MAY BE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED FOR YOU. DO NOT CLICK IF IT COULD BRING UP BAD FEELINGS) was the ""last picture taken"" of Cory. However, this is **not** Cory on a stretcher under a blanket - it is Amy Winehouse. When Google image searching, you'll find that it pulls up ""Amy Winehouse Death"" or something along those lines when you submit the link to a google reverse image search. As far as we know, the last picture taken and published of Cory was by his mother on her [twitter](https://twitter.com/slimyagent/status/355530966191718401/photo/1) on July 11th.

**Rumor #4:** Cory Monteith died of an overdose. This is the biggest rumor out there. There's no doubt that it could've in fact been an overdose due to the fact that he had been battling drug abuse and had gone to rehab multiple times, however, according to Sgt Randy Fincham of the Canadian police, ""there was nothing to indicate Monteith's death was due to illicit drug use."" ""Foul play"" has also been ruled out of the equation. The toxicology tests are still being run, but as of now, no legitimate report of the cause has been released yet. 

Not completely sure of how reliable this [article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2364549/Cory-Monteith-planning-girlfriend-Lea-Michele-death--Canadian-police-reveal-indicate-death-drugs.html) is, however, I found a lot of the information to be more fact and informative based than other articles.

Hopefully this helped some of you guys and cleared up some false information that's being spread around! As I said before, please ask questions and comment any other rumors you have come across so all of us can work together to clear these up.

EDIT: The Vancouver Police Department just [tweeted](https://twitter.com/VancouverPD) ""As per coroner, Cory Monteith died of mixed drug toxicity, involving heroin and alcohol. #BCCS"" 
The VPD also released this [video](http://youtu.be/TkiyUG6MsrA) explaining the cause.",,False,self,t5_2royn,1374009636.0,,,True,t3_1idtkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1idtkv/official_cory_monteith_rumors/,

(SPOILERS, if you haven't seen Shooting Star, STAY OUT!)",EricGMW,115,19,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1c8zrj/friendly_psa_spoilers_if_you_havent_seen_shooting/,"I teach high school in Ontario... and while I have been fortunate enough not to have seen or experienced a hostile situation in the school (there have been incidents in the vicinity of the school, but in those cases we just lock the external doors and carry on), we run lockdown drills all the time. I wanted to comment about the situation and crisis management in this episode, parts of which were appropriate responses, a lot of which really made me cringe... 


1) All of the teachers were running towards the door and slamming them shut! If the shooter is right outside your door, they will have seen you slamming your door already. So teachers have a responsibility to take a quick look around, and direct as many kids as possible into their rooms and then close the door. I always leave my door locked by default; the last thing you want to do is fiddle with keys. Students, at the same time, know that they don't just run madly down the hall: get into the nearest open door immediately! I was disgusted when doors were slammed *as kids were running right in front of them*.


2) Principal Figgins had a duty as well, to get on the PA system and announce a full lockdown to the entire school. You could argue it exposes the Principal, and every man for himself, and whatever... but that is never true in a crisis like this, and especially not for a principal, who must be responsible for everyone in the building. 


3) I was horrified when Schuster actively encouraged the Glee club members to whip out their phones and text everyone and anyone. During a lockdown crisis, turn your phones off and text and call no one. All throughout the segment, phones were vibrating, ringing... a vibrating cell phone could have gotten Marley's mother killed. Furthermore, imagine a thousand cell phones trying to send out a text message or a phone call; the cell phone network is liable to crash, preventing actual important calls from going out.


4) Doors should be locked... check. Window blinds should be covered... check. Windows on doors should be covered... check, mostly, I think. 


5) Students should not just hide behind things... Students should be seated in an area away from the line of sight of any windows or doors, should a gunman decide to shoot through the door. Depending on the material used to construct walls, a safe place for students to sit would be at the base of the wall that also has doors installed. Especially if the school is an older school with cinder-block-type bricks.


6) Do not under any circumstances let students out, or answer any doors if someone is knocking. Beiste and Schuster were entirely within their rights to manhandle Sam, for the safety of the students. Sadly, then we get to #7...


7) I was almost *screaming* when I saw Schuster on the other side of the stall door in the bathroom. ""No one leaves"" most definitely includes teachers. I'm sorry, but maybe there was 1 student, 3, or 10 in the bathroom. But Schuster is responsible for the students in the Glee club practice room, and he put those kids in danger twice - first by leaving, and second by returning and knocking, thereby forcing students to question whether it's really him on the other side of the door or not. And if it was really a gunman, it won't matter whether the students lifted the paper taped to the door window, or just opened it wide without checking.


8) Finally, there *must* be absolute silence in the room during a lockdown. So, no phones, no moving around, no video confessions... 

Before anyone argues that it was a time of crisis and teenagers will be teenagers and may panic, or feel scared, or need to comfort one another... they should also remember that any little thing they do that might draw attention to the room might get their friends killed.

This is my opinion (I'm sorry mods if this is wrong, couldn't think of a better place!)",kiwias,98,13,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1ie0rd/ive_seen_a_lot_of_hate_recently_about_how_glee/,"The following is a comment I tried to post on [this](http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/glee-deal-cory-monteiths-death/story?id=19668510) article. But somehow it won't let me so I want to put it here:

I'm only addressing this comment toward your criticism of the school shooting episode.

I have been in a school shooting situation in high school. For me, it turned out like Glee did, a student that really meant no harm. 

The way Glee portrayed that situation had me in tears. I arrived to school one day and was rushed into the open gymnasium. It was so chaotic that no one even knew who or where the shooter was. At one point the police and Vice Principal (along with National Guard members) came into the gym looking for the shooter there.

The point is: the way the story was portrayed, to me, was extremely accurate. My friends, and people I didn't particularly like, were huddled together in fear. Some were crying, while some were still confused. We were texting anybody and everybody (this was in 2005, before social media was what is is today). 

I can 100% relate to the characters on the show. I can relate 100% to the way it was portrayed in subsequent episodes as well. Yes, it was scary, but no one was hurt. We pulled ourselves together and moved on; just like they did in the show.

I have been watching Glee for many years, although I didn't begin watching it until the second season was already airing.

I've had friends become pregnant, I've had friends deal with eating disorders, and once again I've been apart of a school shooting situation.

Glee is a show that tries its best to emulate what is going on in the world. I wish more than anything it was around when I was in high school, because while I have never been into show choir, it really could have helped me grow in ways I could only imagine now.

All of the characters on this show portray people I can relate to, and yes that includes outrageous characters such as Sue. Glee has had its ups and downs, but that happens with any popular or mainstream sensation.

I strongly, STRONGLY believe that the writers and actors of Glee can find a way to make a tribute to Cory. No matter what they do we need to remember that THEY knew Cory 100 times better than any fan did. THEY are the ones that should feel the most comfortable with how they honor him. If they choose to just write out the character without a death, then that's how they feel comfortable. If they choose to include a death, then that's how they feel comfortable.

Point is: we are NOT the ones most affected by this absolute tragic situation. Yes Glee and Fox are businesses, but at the end of the day I strongly believe they, including Ryan Murphey, Lea Michele, and every other cast member that considered him family, will make the best decision. And whatever they choose to do, we as fans have to respect that.

These people are not only wonderful people, but wonderful actors. They have proved that on Glee, other TV shows and Movies, and some even on Broadway.

Don't judge them by one or two episodes, believe in them that they can honor him the best way they know how. Because they will.

RIP Cory Monteith.",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_1ie0rd,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1ie0rd/ive_seen_a_lot_of_hate_recently_about_how_glee/,

Get the key characters to NYC. Skip to next year. The key here is that all the Glee kids in New York need to be linked by two things. A common group and a common goal. Something significant enough to keep them together even though conflict is being constantly introduced. Like, for example, a shared interest in helping Artie win a film festival that could be a starting point for their careers. 

So. Make Rachel the understudy for Funny Girl, and have her struggle to balance her workload with classes and her commitment to a role she doesn't even have full time. Meanwhile, give Kurt a prominent (but not lead) role in the upcoming NYADA production. Let Kurt thrive in classes where Rachel is struggling- prompting both rivalry and self doubt on her part. 

Meanwhile, Santana starts working at a karaoke bar, where she runs into Artie in New York. He's in film school and he's struggling to find actors willing to work with him because he wants to incorporate a lot of his musical background into the work, but he's a prick and people don't like working with him. So Santana, being the fame whore that she is, sees an opportunity. She recruits Rachel and Kurt and the three of them join the project. 

Finn shows up at some point. Santana, in a moment of weakness, gets him a job at the bar where she's working. This is important because now all the characters have a reason to randomly be at this bar and singing. No more random songs. They sing for the movie, the classes, when doing karaoke, etc. Max of 4 songs per episode. No more top 40. 

Anyways, Finn joins the project and that's when it really starts to come together. We're pretending he wasn't such a mess in the past and giving him a chance again. It's nice because even though he's struggling to figure out what to do in all the other areas of his life, he's able to really bring out the talent and keep everyone together on this project. 

Until Rachel melts down mid-season. They've been facing minor difficulties up to this point- funding, costumes, rivalry, sabotage, but the project has been going ok. But Rachel finally snaps from all the pressure of her role as understudy and all the classes she's doing poorly in. She quits the movie and drops out of school to ""pursue her career"". 

Meanwhile, there's plenty of interesting stuff going on with everyone else. We'll keep Finchel off again for now- but not dating anyone else. Maybe Blaine can come to NY- but really there's no reason to have him there because he's never really been interesting or functional outside of his role as Kurt's boyfriend. We could probably redefine him, but outside of appealing to Klainers I'm not sure it's necessary. Having Blaine loses you a lot of underdog points. And Kurt should maybe be single for a while. He can achieve quite a lot of success in classes and in the roles where he's being cast, but maybe after a while he hits a ceiling. Realizes in the second half of the season that he's never going to be the powerhouse that can land the really big roles and has to shift his focus. Personally I liked the idea of Kurt in fashion. 

Santana can flounder. Maybe she can start sleeping with guys again after her split from Brit and go through some self doubt. Maybe she just wants to be famous again. I'm a fan of making Santana a bit of a mess before she figures it out and starts to hustle. 

The point is, these 5 at least are going to be together- with common goals and interests. Setbacks, and real character development. The only ones from Lima in the big city, with no idea what they're doing, really. Trying to figure out if these dreams are worth gambling their lives on, trying to figure out who they are on their own, trying to figure out how to build on what they learned in high school instead of clinging to it and refusing to leave that shelter. 

Have a plot. A SEASON-LONG plot. Dreaming this up took about as long as typing it, and there's a million other ways to do it. We can incorporate whatever characters, but the more you add the harder it is to do each one justice. Just have a plan, please, writers. Don't forget stuff. Don't go for the cheap laugh. Figure out a midseason and a season-long plot for each character. Then tie them together. Then use each episode to do a plot of the week AND advance the big story. 

I legitimately thing this show could be rescued pretty easily if the writers showed some self control and made a good plan. They have some fantastic talent and characters that we have huge emotional attachment to already. Take advantage of it.

Go into the comments and it's one after the other talking about how much the show sucks and how people who watch it are idiots. I get how the hivemind works, but seriously? People seem to hate how young people who watch the show assume that songs were made by Glee and don't know who the original artist is. Problem is, the only place I've ever heard of this actually happening is on Reddit! Someone will post a link of a FB or Yahoo screencap where some high schooler says something like ""oh i didn't know [insert loved band here] sang that song, I thought it was from Glee!""

(Spoilers for the finale and the season inside),Mottaman,63,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1e218s/that_was_the_finale_spoilers_for_the_finale_and/,"That was one of the worst season finale's for a show I have ever seen. But what was I really expecting when the show has been all over the place for the majority of the season.

1)Ok so Brittney is at MIT, she gets an almost perfect SAT score but a 0 on a basic math test. Instead of calling her a cheater she is some sort of savant like the people in the recently canceled show Touch. And instead of them taking her to study her they give her a scholarship and give her early admissions to boot. Now I know the timeline is pretty messed up, but there is no way we are still in the fall which is when early admissions exists, especially since just last week Kurt looked at a calendar for APRIL. But in the Glee world I guess we learned last year, you dont get your college acceptance letters until after graduation.

2) Oh look, Sugar and Joe are back. It was obviously something special since everyone clapped when they entered the room. Lets just gloss over the fact that they were off tv for weeks with no explanation.

3) Rachel sings.... has about 3 min of camera time with no actual plot movement... but heaven forbid we dont feature a song from Lea Michele in the finale, even if its completely without a storyline within the episode. 2 spots she could have been used in for the episode that would have made more sense... Her 2 gay dads could have been the role models for Blaine and Kurt or she could have flown back with Santana to watch regionals, at least those would have been part of the story.

4) Lets build up the catfish story very slowly over like 6 episodes, but lets throw some episodes in the middle so you forget its even a plot thread. Then lets just have Ryder throw a hissy fit out of the blue after just being a whiny little bitch about it for weeks. His explosion should have happened weeks ago.

5)Didn't Finn rejoin New Directions like 3 episodes ago to help lead them to regionals? Didn't he and Will make up? Doesn't he and Puck live like a stones throw away since he goes to a community college in Lima? Where was he last week when his step father got his cancer news?

6)What happened to Becky? Last we saw of her she was telling Figgins something secret, that was 2-3 episodes ago. We assume it was that she brought the gun, clearing Sue's name but it hasn't been mentioned and she hasnt been seen since.

7)Wasnt there a whole episode a couple of years ago about how they need 12 kids to perform? In the hours leading up to the performance neither Ryder or Brittney were confirmed to show up. Maybe they could assume Ryder would be a good guy but at that point in the episode there was no reason for them to know Brittney would show up and they were surprised that she did. Without her they were 11 and would have been DQed.
Hell just about the only thing about the episode that was done right was actually having Mike Chang and Mercedes backstage during the performance since they were coaching, but Schu should have been with them too.

Then the wedding, pulled out of left field for no reason. It didn't fit into the episode and was obviously only shoehorned in bc it was the finale, but it had no real lead up and felt undeserved. This season had no rhythm, no consistency, no focus. It tried to make about a million stories but instead of focusing on a few at a time and giving them conclusions it just felt like the episodes were out of order. The cast is too big and they need to either make NYC a spinnoff or kill the HS at this point. The first couple of seasons worked because you only had a few main characters. You had Rachel, Finn, Schu and Kurt. Quinn and Sue were secondary and everyone else basically sang in the background. Stories were told, they had a beginning a middle and an end and people were happy. Now you have 20 people fighting for screen time and its just a mess.",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_1e218s,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1e218s/that_was_the_finale_spoilers_for_the_finale_and/,

I don't understand why some people think it's another example of bad Glee writing. Marley feeling self-conscious is not something illogical, it makes complete sense because of her mom's weight and the way all of the students pick on her mom. Marley probably already had some fear of becoming overweight before Kitty even messed with her Grease costume. People are also making the argument that Marley shouldn't feel fat just because a costume, that she should've noticed the way her normal clothes still fit her. The fact is, though, that when people have issues with weight, they always look at the negative. Marley wouldn't care that some clothes still fit her. Besides, she's always wearing her normal clothes so they may stretch to fit her body, while the Grease costume is something she's only putting on for a couple hours. And then there are the arguments that her other costumes fit her, like the tight pants at the end of the Grease, but that wouldn't matter to Marley. She is genuinely worried that she is gaining weight like crazy. No matter what, she is only going to pay attention to the things that make her feel fat and no matter what, she will see herself as fat. That's just how these disorders work. They can't be fixed by looking in the mirror or reading a scale. Eating disorders are a very serious thing and I think that Glee is actually doing a fairly good job portraying Marley's right now.

The show has heavily implied that Kitty is Katie. I don't buy it.

Some things Ryder mentioned:

* Unique. The ringtone he called was not the same as Unique's ringtone has been. Unique could have a different ringtone for each number, or the Bootylicious ringtone mentioned could have been assigned to a specific number. Also, someone who could be Unique was typing in the library while Ryder was.

* Brittany already has Sam  
* It's not Jake  
* Marley would make sense plot wise, based on the love triangle and other factors.  
* I think it could be Blaine. The camera focused on Blaine after Ryder sent the text ""Where are you?""

My issues: Why hadn't Ryder called this mystery person before, Skyped him/her, or heard this person's voice?

If I heard him correctly, Ryder said that he and Katie had exchanged messages over Facebook. If this was the case, the fake Katie must have either hacked the real Katie's account OR created a duplicate account.

If Ryder has all the phone numbers of the Glee Club, wouldn't Katie's number show up as a duplicate? This is also assuming Katie doesn't have a second phone.

Edit: Blaine has been crushing on Sam but that plot line could be over and/or he could be crushing on more than one person at once. 

Other options, suggested by Gleeks:

* Tina. This is a very viable option and I hadn't considered it before. Tina is lonely and wants some sort of appreciation. This appreciation/loving could be met through online dating. Also, we know she was outside of the school when the rest of her club was inside. She could have gone to the bathroom and left her phone and backpack in the room. This would also be why nobody jumped for the phone when it was ringing and why the person didn't have it in their hand in the choir room. Tina would also know where the secret Glee Club meeting was during the assembly. Excellent suggestion /u/dearkitteh!

* Becky. Possible but her character already has too much going on. /u/obsidianpanther

* Sue. Possible but unlikely. She did show up outside the choir room at 3:30 and she is just evil and cunning enough to do this sort of thing, but again, her character has a lot going on. /u/that_is_so_awesome

* Coach Beiste. She had been doing some online dating as well this episode, but it seems like Will was acting as Coach Beiste and she'd never tried online dating, so that would mean... Will was hitting on Ryder? Unlikely. /u/shady666king

But I was thinking... what if Katie doesn't exist at all, either the online persona or the person behind the persona?

What if Ryder is imagining all of this? The IMs, the SMS texts, all of it, and that this is all a prelude to an episode about mental illness and schizophrenia?

I know it sounds far-fetched, and it probably is, but, well, everyone's jumping onto the ""Who's Katie"" thing, I figure I'd contribute. 

No one has ever seen Katie. No one has ever talked to Katie or heard Katie speak. Katie doesn't text anyone else in the club besides Ryder. 

During the shooting incident, someone's phone went off while Ryder called. Coincidence? Possibly. As word spread of the shooting, it's not unreasonable to think that people on the outside would try to call in to make sure someone was safe.

Is it hard to imagine that two episodes from now, someone's going to ""wake Ryder up"", and Ryder discovers that there is absolutely no record of either receiving any texts from Katie, or having sent any texts to Katie, and that all of their interaction was in Ryder's mind?

1367397116.0,48,self.glee,1dgz7k,Marley is Katie.,Phallindrome,64,16,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1dgz7k/marley_is_katie/,"I rewatched 4x15. Marley confesses in the bathroom to Kitty that Ryder kissed her, and he was good, but she still likes Jake. Kitty tells her she should collect as many boys as possible.

I rewatched 4x16, the first episode of the catfish arc. There are two Katie conversations. In the first, Katie uses the line ""His truth is his truth."" This line is also used by Marley in the latest episode, as mentioned in the other Katie thread by SilverTongie. In the second conversation, Katie asks Ryder about Marley:

&gt;Katie: What about Marley? Arent you still crushing on her?

&gt;Ryder: I'm starting to feel like maybe I've kind of moovd on...

&gt;Ryder: So...

&gt;Ryder: Can we meet?

&gt;*Katie is now offline.*

Then, I rewatched 4x18. In the scene where Ryder confronts Jake and Marley, watch the camera angles in the confrontation scene. All Marley, no Jake. This is the moment where Marley lies because she's terrified of telling him in front of Jake, then realises she has gone way too far.

Two scenes after that, without ANY on-screen contact between Ryder and Katie, Katie texts Ryder. Their conversation:

&gt;Katie: Hey.

&gt;Ryder: What do u want?

&gt;Katie: Please don't be mad.

&gt;Ryder: Of course i'm mad

&gt;Ryder: You've been lying 2 me this entire time (Can I point out how weird it is for someone to use apostrophes AND number substitutions in the same text?)

&gt;Katie: Only about my name and my pic.

&gt;Ryder: Then who the hell r U?

&gt;Katie: I'm just someone who wanted to get close to U.

&gt;Katie: Someone shy, who didn't think u'd like me in person.

It goes on. Here's the important line: ""Please don't be mad."" How would Katie know Ryder was mad at her, unless Ryder told her? Either Marley is Katie, or it's someone she or Jake knows. Katie also says she is someone shy. This pretty much typifies Marley.

Next, the phone call in the choir room. Again, remember Glee's tendency to give things away with camera focus. Marley, unlike the other characters, shows no surprise in her face when the phone rings, just dread. She's the first person to repeat Beiste and tell Ryder to cancel the call, responding so fast she's almost waiting for an excuse to say it. As he cancels it, she is trying not to break down. 

So, what do you guys think? Between the question about Marley, the line repeated by Marley, and her reactions in the choir room... is it settled?

You don't sing Starkid songs while standing in line, you don't shout ""I LOVE YOU"" when Darren walks onto to stage and you don't complain that Darren didn't sneak Starkid or Glee references into the show.

There are people who are there to see the show who don't know/care who Darren is.  There is a certain way you need to act when you see a Broadway show.  I don't mean for this to be accusatory or pointing fingers.  I know its exciting for those of you who have been fans of Darren for years, but *act accordingly.*

Also, while we're here, Darren is going to be missing one episode because of H2$, I believe its 3x12.",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_o7kwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/o7kwp/a_note_about_darren_in_h2/,

1. In spite of all the calamity in continuity this season, let's all take a moment to appreciate the fact that we are passed the Auto-Tune travesty that was Season 2, the First Half.

2. Sam Evans and his Carousel Heart.  Remember when he gave Quinn a promise ring?  And then loved Mercedes so much he pined.  PINED FOR HER.  And then suddenly loves Brittany with his entire being.  

3. Matthew Morrison's eyebrows.  Season 3.  I think it happens in episode 6.  Did he dye them?  Something happens to them.  Something that goes against nature.  

4. Having watch season 4 from the beginning a second time, I feel differently about the Brittana breakup.

I'm gay, but Kurt and Blaine's relationship annoys me because it's too perfect, and Blaine is a teenager who [gave up a fairly big chunk of his life(Dalton and the Warblers) in order to be with a guy.](//#spoiler)  First of all, what teenager's parents would let them do that?  Second, how did he [transfer so fast](//#spoiler)?  Seriously, it was like a day.  I know, I know, it's blaspheglee to insult the glorious Klaine, but I just don't care about their story.

Finn is boring, Schue's a dick, Sue's a cartoon, Tina has become a stereotype of the most boring variety, the list goes on.  The most interesting character they've had, Zizces, is not even a regular part of the show anymore.

But ranting about the show is not the point of this post.  I'm just curious if anyone else feel the same way that I do.

Every good television drama needs characters that you *love* to hate. These characters act as foils, and they always point to something that is very human. No matter how evil these characters are, they're always interesting to watch - Sue is a perfect example of a character that you love to hate.

I cannot and do not think the same way of Kitty. To me, she is a vile character, and I find that as an audience member, I can't even stand to watch her scenes. This is not a comment on the actress, I think the role of Kitty has been played well; but the character is intolerable for me. I watch Glee because I find it enjoyable. She is simply not enjoyable to watch and listen to.

1338306075.0,41,self.glee,uag9b,Anyone else agree with the NYADA decision?,tmg1325,53,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/uag9b/anyone_else_agree_with_the_nyada_decision/,"I've seen a lot of posts that are outraged that Rachel got in and Kurt didn't, but I think you're ignoring some mitigating factors here- first, that apparently Whoopi's character had a similar experience. The fact that Rachel appealed to that might have struck a real chord with her.

Second, yeah- if you mess up it's over and you don't get in, everyone knows that- except the people who ignore it. Sure, they don't talk about it because if it were common knowledge then everyone would do it, but do you really think that no admissions decision ever gets changed? Especially the ones left up to the discretion of an individual? It's like getting a job- a lot of times when they tell you no and that you don't meet qualifications, if you just keep calling anyway you stand a decent chance of getting hired. Or getting a restraining order taken out against you. Either way, a lot of the time what matters most is being willing to WANT something enough to ignore how many times you've been told ""no"". 

Third, while Rachel did blow her audition, the fact remains that her vocals are fantastic. Lea Michele is a Broadway-class performer. Kurt is a good singer with a very unique voice for a male, but he's not actually in her league. For someone with that much raw ability, sometimes a school will take a chance even though it's established that she screwed up before. It's like when schools ignore a 2.8 GPA because someone got a 36 on the ACT. It totally sucks for the person who busted their ass all through school to earn a higher GPA and maybe isn't as naturally brilliant, but from the school's perspective sometimes it's better to take a risk to get a genius rather than going with the safe option that will always be solid but might not ever be the very best.

Fourth, the endorsements from Jesse and Tina were very carefully worded to really emphasize that in addition to talent, Rachel has drive. Even if you like Kurt better and even though he did better in his audition, I don't think anyone can argue that he actually worked harder for this than Rachel. Hate her if you want, call her a Mary-Sue, but you can't argue that her character works very very hard for the things she then assumes she deserves. And hearing over and over that a person so talented is also that passionate and driven would be enough to give an admissions officer pause, I think, even though Rachel choked.

Finally, it wasn't like Whoopi was deciding between Kurt and Rachel. She was deciding who was good enough to get in. It wasn't a direct contest- Rachel didn't get Kurt's spot. So even though to us it may feel like someone ignored the fact that Kurt did well and gave his spot to someone who flubbed their audition, in actuality those decisions were made entirely independently. Rachel messed up, but then was able to persevere and convince the judge that her sheer vocal ability made her a good risk. Kurt did well, but at the end of the day his vocals weren't enough to get him in. And since we have no idea what the competition is like, there's no way to know if he should have gotten in- all can do is assume that the vocal bar was set somewhere in between where the two of them perform.

***All that said, it was ridiculous the way she basically told him that he had made it and then snatched it away. ",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_uag9b,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/uag9b/anyone_else_agree_with_the_nyada_decision/,

This is what I think:

* I have never known a university teacher to be so involved in the life of a first year student. First years drop out all the time. It takes years of work to be worthy of this much attention.

* Rachel is downright rude to Cassandra just about every class. Yes Cassandra has an attitude but a dancer learns to take it. Dancers never tell dance teachers that they know everything and give career guidance to the teacher, that is disrespectful. Traditional dance classes have very strict rules for student-teacher etiquette, mostly it's shut up and take the criticism and if you need a cry go outside and take a breather.

* I don't understand why Cassandra would even be bothered by Rachel. Yes Rachel is rude but Cassandra could just victimise her in class. Clearly Rachel is worse than everyone in the room, all you have to do is keep pointing out her flaws to everyone, make her show everyone how not to dance and refuse her a dance partner until she is good enough. They're not nice things to do but I think Cassandra has too much pride and self absorption to be thinking about Rachel outside of their class time.

* Rachel never seems to be paying attention to her technique in dance classes. She is either too busy talking, trying to show that she is a star, or trying to prove a point. Considering she cares passionately about her NYADA education and that her dance skills are clearly lacking, I don't understand why she isn't focusing on becoming better in dance classes. That means put your damn hair up because it will whip you in the eye every time you turn, stop wearing so much eye makeup as it should move when you sweat oh and start sweating!

You want to see what I mean? Go to [/r/community](/r/community). Right now. Those fans appreciate the show that they watch and the characters in it! 

I'm sick and tired of it being so 'cool' for us to not only bag on the show, but on almost every single character within it. The only characters that seem above the biting criticism are Santana and Quinn, and both have probably been the bitchiest girls on this show. Yeah, Quinn's changed which is great. But Santana continues to act the way she does and everybody kisses her ass. 

Meanwhile, we all just love to rip apart all the characters we're supposed to cheer for Rachel/Finn/Will...what happened to our Glee spirit? 

It's like Glee decided to become less snarky over these seasons and *tried* to be more genuine and proud of itself but the fans got more snarky and can't take a show that won't make fun of itself every week.

I had forgotten how good the Finchel breakup scene was, how emotional I felt the first time I saw it, and then to hear Finn say these things to Rachel and how some of them are so relevant now that Cory - and by extension, Finn - is dead. It just, it had me sobbing.


   


""I wanna marry you so badly I can't go through with it...Are you one hundred percent sure you want to marry me?""

""No one is one hundred percent sure of anything.""

""I am. I am that sure you're something special. That this is just the beginning for you. That you're gonna do amazing things. But to get there you gotta have these experiences on your own. I can't have to be there with you.""


   



""Do you know how hard this is for me? How many times I've cried about this?

""No, I'm not going. I'm not going, not without you!""

""You don't have a choice. I can't come with you.""

""Well, then I'll stay here! I'll go wherever it is you're going!""

You know what we're going to do? Surrender. I know how hard that is for you because I know how hard you hold on to stuff, but we're just gonna sit here and we're gonna let go.""


  


And then Rachel is singing ""Sometimes I don't wanna feel/ forget the pain is real/ put my head in the clouds,"" and Finn is trying to smile and wave and look happy for her, but really he just looks broken and like he's just made a big mistake. And then he's chasing after the train and Rachel has her hand on the window and he stops and she falls apart.

I just finished season 1 and I had a thought about how the show could handle Cory's death. 

I think the only reasonable excuse for Finn's absence would be to kill him off the show. Although it would be terrible for the cast to have to endure double the pain of losing Cory, there just isn't any other explanation for why Finn would no longer be on the show. 
If the writers do decide to kill Finn, I hope it would be in a respectable way, such as a car accident or unfortunate event. 
Now, all of that being said, I think the best thing for the show and its ratings would be for Lea to sing Faithfully (first song from regionals in season 1) again as a tribute to him. I think the song has a great emotional connection and it would really be a great tribute to Cory. 
Anyone else agree or have similar thoughts?

I mean absolutely no disrespect to either actor, and this might be too soon with Cory's death, and I apologize in advance to whomever I might offend. 

With that said, I have been curious about this for a long time. Firstly, why is Finn considered to be the lead male for all this time? His voice doesn't seem classically trained and he seems to struggle with many of the songs that he sings, and tends to stick to rap and classic rock where he can hide some of his singing flaws. Don't get me wrong, Cory is a good singer and a phenomenal actor, and in many instances it is hinted that Finn has little classical training... But they joke about his dancing all the time and use that as a point of character development... But then his singing is okay and he's the undisputed lead male except for that one time with Jessie or Blane (both of which are so mind blowingly fantastic at singing, but still lose to Finn). But still, his place is never really challenged by some of the group male powerhouses, like Puck, Sam or Artie. It was such a main storyline about the girls, and Rachel's talent is absolutely mind blowing. Why hide Finn's singing rather than using it as character development? When I say hide I mean similar to Gerard Butler's phantom. He did a great job as someone who just learned singing, but the phantom is a musical genius who is teaching a lead opera star how to sing... He shouldn't end a note that it supposed to warble with vibrato with a growl... Anybody who knows singing knows its a coverup. 

Also, why do they treat Kurt like his singing is almost as good as Rachel's? He is a self declared tenor, but he only sings in one way, were Rachel had a full vocal range... And again, this could have been something addressed on the show. They join glee to learn, not just to show their talents. Not to mention, why have him sing women's songs so much when there are tons of interesting tenor music out there... Like phantom, prince, etc. I would have much preferred to see some of the other female singers on the show sing these songs.

For context, ""Rock The Shores"" is a music festival the stations are sponsoring this week. A number of the staff at the station are his age and knew him personally.

The station had a feature called ""My Turn"" where regular people could host an hour of radio. Cory signed up and did it when he was in town. The audio really shows how humble he was, and how much he appreciated his community.

For me, this show is my ""chocolate ice cream"" -- when I'm down or I've had a bad day, I throw on a Glee marathon and my day brightens up, mostly because of moments like these:

* Burt Hummel dancing for Kurt's graduation present
* Will bringing Emma down the hallway as Sue, Coach Beiste hand her white roses for the engagement surprise
* Santana's Lebanese shirt
* Rachel trying to talk sense into Quinn about making a stupid decision
* Rachel singing ""Without You""
* The whole group getting together to help Sam's family
* Artie calling the group on their bullshit attitude about him going on a date with Becky
* Kurt *going back in* to accept the prom queen title
* The girls singing ""Shake it out"" to coach Beiste

and countless other moments, great songs, wonderfully written scenes.

This show actually means something to me, and I hope I'm not in the minority here.

Edit: Also, one time one of my customer's called Glee ""Kids bop for adults"" and I wanted to punch their face. I didn't, but it was kinda rude.

**Characters:**


*Previous characters:*

As for previous characters on the show, many minors ones are still unconfirmed, but on the basis for more major/upcoming ones, this the current status update. Sugar (Vanessa Lengies), Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Joe (Samuel Larsen) are all confirmed to be coming back. Rory (Damian McGinty) is confirmed to not be coming back for at least the first half of the season, with a possibility of coming back in the second half.

Wade/Unique (Alex Newell), Harmony (Lindsay Pearce), and Sebastian (Grant Gustin) are still unconfirmed as of right now.

*New regular/recurring characters:*

There are also descriptions of new characters that will be coming into the mix. Puck’s younger brother will be joining the scene. There are also descriptions for a pretty female high school student (assumed to be at McKinley) and a 20 year old male (assumed to be with one of the graduates, rumored to be at NYADA with Rachel). There is also a casting call for a 16 year old “beautiful, bitchy, blonde” cheerleader with great dance moves.

Also two actresses, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kate Hudson have confirmed roles in the new season. Sarah Jessica Parker will be a manager of sorts towards Kurt, but it is unknown how long she will be in this role. Kate Hudson has a role for six episodes as Rachel’s dance instructor at NYADA.

There is also at least the confirmed spot on the show for the Glee Project Season Two winner, with potential room for others if for some reason there ends up being multiple winners as in the previous season.

*Guest roles:*

There are some actors and singers attempting/planning on making appearances throughout the season. Matt Bomer and Gloria Estefan are both willing/wanting to reprise their roles as Cooper Anderson and Maribel Lopez, respectively, if asked to do so in the future.

Adam Levine is in discussions for a guest spot on the show and Jessica Sanchez (American Idol Season 11 runner-up) is in discussions for a multi-episode arc.

Cheryl Cole is rumored to be making a cameo this season according to Jane Lynch.

**Overarching Plot:**

There are some overall plot themes/devices that will be implemented throughout the whole season.

Many have been wondering how detrimental/balanced the split between the graduates and the high schoolers will be. It was said that the split will be very much like the split in season two between McKinley and Dalton when Kurt was at Dalton. The club will return to underdog status due to loss of many of their members and scrambling to get new ones. 

The season is said to be more pop-culture based and more mature. There will also be fewer characters than ever according to Ryan Murphy, as well as that they are returning to a more season one-esque style of focusing on four to five characters with the rest being flavors that complement the main story line.

**Character Plot:**

*Couples/Teams:*

Will and Emma will not be married right away, as stated in a season three episode, the wedding will take place around Christmas.

Will and Sue will no longer be enemies and will befriend one another, however they will come up against new enemies.

Finn and Rachel’s relationship will set the scene for the beginning of season four.

*Character Specific:*

Sue has already had her baby by the time the season starts, yet we will still not know the father.

Rachel will be featured in most if not all the episodes of this upcoming season. She has been confirmed to sing in the first two episodes, one of which in the first one being a Barbara Streisand song. She may also be given a makeover by Sarah Jessica Parker’s character.

Finn may be heading to army boot camp; it is still unconfirmed where his character is going exactly.

Kurt at first will be in Ohio still, not knowing what to do, and will try and help repopulate the New Directions with Will. He is also said to be going to NYC, but not NYADA.

Santana is going to the University of Louisville.

*Episode Specific:*

The second episode of the season will be a tribute episode to Britney Spears. There is said to be a stage catastrophe and lots of Brittany’s character being displayed.

* let's cool it with the ""look who i saw in ________"" posts.  jane lynch and dot marie jones have been in a lot of stuff.  you may, however, post things about upcoming projects outside of glee that the actors may have.

* check if something you've found has been posted already.  easiest way is to put the full link in the search box.  if its been posted, and the search function is working properly, it should take you to the post.

* if you've found spoilers/new songs/promos/pictures for the upcoming episode, please post them in the spoiler discussion posts rather than making them their own post.

Also, I'm open to suggestions on sidebar images.  I just thought the current one was cute.

Thank you everyone.  Let's enjoy season 4!",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_zuxy2,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/zuxy2/welcome_to_a_new_season_rglee/,moderator

I've always worked with teenagers in different support settings (shelters, drop-ins, counselling) so watching the first few seasons play out was nice for a bunch of reasons: a popular show that wasn't about the popular kids; interesting and less stereotypical portrayals of LGBTQ characters; plus the whole music+drama thing, which I figure is a great fit for teenagers, given how big a part music often plays in their lives.  'Course, when you actually work with people who are anorexic, BPD, in and out of juvi, not gay but falling into some other ostracized minority, it's kinda galling to see their treatment of those subjects.  So for years, I've watched and sometimes enjoyed, sometimes screamed at the tv, sometimes had half a mind to write to Ryan Murphy and demand to be their head writer because the people they have are morons.

So I'd like to try a rewrite, or collection of rewrite ideas.  Feel free to chime in and support, criticize and/or offer alternatives, but ultimately this isn't actually a work of fanfic so much as catharsis for ""Damnit Glee, you missed such a golden opportunity with this.""  But rather than try and rewrite the whole series, I thought it might be a little easier to handle to just start over from S4, same basic characters (though some personality tweaking seems fair).  My basic ground rules were:

1) Mental health issues should be portrayed accurately insofar as they not needlessly triggering or complicated to the audience.  No need to spew the whole textbook diagnosis at them, but it might even be helpful to be able to show how some problems will look ""in real life"", to try and debunk some of the more stereotypical portrayals of them. (Suicide is an excellent candidate for this sort of thing)

2) Generally, the *kids* should have depth, complex motivations if necessary, and mixed feelings while the *adults* should be fairly straightforward, even simplistic (""the mean teacher"", ""wise janitor"", ""crazy secretary"").  The ""cool parents exception"" probably comes in as they start to cross over with their kids - parents shouldn't divorce for frivolous reasons, and that complexity is welcome if the story revolves around it.  If it's truly a show for teenagers, it makes the kids more relatable, and heck it might even make them more interesting to play, because sometimes the actors seem to really hate their characters.  That also demands a little empathy, and being able to see past ""Oh yeah, you're sad now but it's not a big deal, you'll get over it, things will get better, you'll see!""... Really _listening_ to what they might be feeling and not needing to fix it immediately or end the episode on a high note.

3) The music sequences don't necessarily have to reflect fact and fit into the plot.  In fact, I rather like them being sometimes fantasy sequences, sometimes just musically-minded kids jamming out together (why don't they do that more, incidentally?).  Most importantly, though, every couple of episodes or so, I think it's particularly important that someone do a song that expresses how they feel **in a way they aren't able to express normally**.  Music was really resonant for me as a teen because it was like, ""Oh gawd yeah that's EXACTLY how I feel!"" or ""Yeah, this song is SO me.""  That's probably why teens feel so connected with the artists behind the songs too, and post lyrics all over the place.   I think that'd be a nice way to go, and open the door to bring in some super expressive but sometimes agonizing songs, maybe as dramatic climaxes where the song reveals what they've been feeling (*""Oh, he really did love me...""*), or even casts the entire story in a whole new light (*""Wait, she did all that horrible stuff because she hated herself?""*).


I'll start in a reply just to keep it cleaner.

I didn't like it too much, but it was definitely better than anything in season 3. 4x03 was pretty good too. The only thing I didn't really like was the Lima parts. I felt that Lima was old news and always wanted it to go to New York. Other than that, I felt it was really good, especially the ending and plus I'm super excited for next week's episode.

1368465178.0,21,self.glee,1e967s,Why I have high hopes for Glee,itsthe90s,28,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1e967s/why_i_have_high_hopes_for_glee/,"Although I was pretty disappointed with season 4, I will definitely be watching season 5 (and 6!) with high hopes and here's why.

I think they're in line to make a more long-term plot arc and actually stick to it. A lot of shows experience a lack of plot after the storyline they start with has to end. The whole point of the show was to get to nationals and win and graduate and move on. Season 3 finished up that main idea and now they're lost but knowing they'll be around for 2 more years gives them an opportunity to develop a strong long-term plot without the fear of being cancelled.

Unfortunately, getting renewed for 2 seasons while the current season is having low ratings is typically just a network courtesy for the writers and creators to finish things up tastefully before cancellation. Although I love the show and music and wish it could run for another few seasons, you can't expect it to be great and go on forever when you start with sophomores in high school trying to win a competition and after 3 years the majority graduate and take home a nationals trophy.

The other top reason I'm excited for Glee in the future is because they're changing the pace (the kids just finished regionals as a season finale, a competition that usually happens around episode 14) which means less awkward post-high school story lines and they're breaking the season into two main parts which means glee will be new for 12 weeks, then take 12 weeks off, then have another 10-12 weeks on. I'm honestly just excited for anything that keeps the plot on a timeline and helps the writers build to something ACTUALLY happening rather than the jumbled plot mess that season 4 was. 

Sorry this post is crazy long, I just wanted to address some of the reasons I think this season wasn't as good as the others and then also try to change the minds of those who say they'll stop watching because I think Glee could be in for a major come back!

I've had a problem with the writing since about the second season (though I'm still watching the show, so whatever). In all honesty, the inconsistency, unbalance, and lack of character development/blatant reversal of character development sort of boggles my mind.

Anyway, if I could change anything (and I do have several other ideas, but this one is the biggest in my mind), I would have had Tina be the one who got into the car accident instead of Quinn. It's always bothered me that Tina hasn't really ever had much of a storyline (and the fact that they've started making jokes about it sort of irritates me), but it would've given her a storyline, created an interesting relationship between her and Artie, and would've made her relationship with Mike (a DANCER) really interesting.

So I just was listening to Don't Stop Belevin' the original version from the pilot and thought that it would be cool to rewatch the scene.

The feelings that I just re-experienced were amazing. I got goosebumps and an exciting feeling in my stomach recapturing all that this scene gave me before. It showed me a show that could understand what it was like to be shit out of luck and not know which way to turn. To feel like you had all this wishing and wanting and exuberance for something greater but no way to bring it forth into success. I remember that this show has shown me great things. It has shown me that there is no way in hell any one should give up on themselves for any reason. There is always a way to pick yourself up and put forth all you have out for the world to see. 

I know that it's easy to pick apart the show recently because of the botched writing, the character development flaws, and all the shit in between. The thing that we have to remember though, is that sometimes, this show can be inspirational, and that even if it inspires one person to move forward, to not look back, to not give up on themselves, to seek support, and to make their life better, then it has served a great purpose.

Obviously we would love for it to be a better piece of art/writing as well and we fondly look back on it as a great show that could've been greater than it is, but we should also remember that this show does wonderful things for so many people, and even though Ryan Murphy will occasionally let that go to his head, there is a reason it is in his head in the first place.

Sorry for this long piece, but I was thinking it would be a cool thing for us to see how this show has done wonders for us in addition to the ways it has made us angry. I know there're reasons for us to be angry with it, but I think it'd be cool for hearing the opposite side.",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_116lv6,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/116lv6/how_has_glee_inspired_you/,

I was just thinking about what songs I would like to hear on the show if they do do a tribute episode. Personally I would love it if the songs from the tribute episode were done entirely live. The cast deserves the chance to sing completely honestly about the man that worked next to them for years. To hear processed and auto-tuned vocals on these songs would really upset me- and I can't imagine how they would feel.

Also I strongly feel that the original ND should all be back for his. Maybe even Dijon Talton. I know he didn't sing or talk much on the show, but he was there in the heyday of Glee, when all the cast really came together working 14 hour days to make an amazing product. But if they can't find a way to work the schedules so Dianna Agron, Mark Salling, Amber Riley, Harry Shum Jr, and Heather Morris are able to pay tribute then I really doubt I would even consider watching.

There are two songs from Spring Awakening that I feel like would be really really perfect, but I can't decide if that would be crossing a line. On one hand the songs are haunting, beautiful, and so appropriate for this. One the other, that's asking a lot of Lea especially considering her personal relationship with both these songs and Cory, to tie yet another part of her life to the tragedy here.


**[Left Behind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBX6Rvd831c)** - sung by Will
[Lyrics](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrolyrics.com%2Fleft-behind-lyrics-spring-awakening.html&amp;h=wAQFrDf5r)

This is actually about a young man that committed suicide, but I think it works quite well for this situation as well. It bemoans the loss of a promising individual and laments that no one really noticed how much pain he was in while he was alive. That fits just fine with a drug overdose by someone that had been struggling with it for a long time.



**[Those You've Known](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlq_9JyBvC8)** - Main part sung by Rachel with the rest of the original ND members doing the background parts
[Lyrics](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrolyrics.com%2Fthose-youve-known-lyrics-spring-awakening.html&amp;h=wAQFrDf5r)

This song is about finding the resolve to move forward after losing someone incredibly important to you, and finding a way to carry their legacy with you and have it give you strength even when you someday move on.



The other songs that I would possibly like to hear:

**[My Heart Will Go On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As)** - sung by Rachel
[Lyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/my-heart-will-go-on-lyrics-celine-dion.html)

This one is pretty obvious. I actually prefer the Spring Awakening songs, especially because this song has a similar meaning to ""Those You've Known"" but doing that song would allow incorporation of the rest of the group. But if they didn't want to do SA, this song is pretty much the staple for this situation, and Rachel always does beautiful covers of Celine Dion songs.



**Don't Stop Believing** - sung as an acoustic number by the group

I don't think you guys need links or lyrics for this one. And I know it's been done a lot of Glee- but if any song really defines the show, that's the song. And a slowed down, honest, emotional version would be pretty much the ultimate way to commemorate Finn.



Those were the ones that immediately came to mind for me. I'd be interested in hearing what other people think. 

***And I'm sorry if it's weird that I'm posting about the show right now. Obviously the real tragedy here is that someone who by all accounts was a great guy has died. But as weirdly guilty and horrible as I feel about it, I know that more than half of the reason this is affecting me so much is because Finn died too- and while I know in the abstract that Cory was a real person, Finn was the one I've connected with for years on my TV.  They've become conflated in a way that is hard for me to separate. And I know it's even worse that I'm making this about me... but this is the first time I've ever dealt with grief from an unexpected death, and I'm not sure how to process it.",,False,self,t5_2royn,1373863198.0,,,True,t3_1ibj2w,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/1ibj2w/songs_you_would_like_to_hear_in_a_tribute_episode/,

The episode was what we have come to expect from Christmas episodes, so I am not complaining but there were two things in the episode that somewhat bothered me:

**Am I supposed to believe Puck and Jake traveled from Ohio to California on a motorcycle?**

I believe Jake questioned Puck about it before their trip but we were lead to believe that they traveled all the way to California by motorcycle and that no other form of transportation was used to get there.

**We're told Marley's family is poor constantly and can't even afford a Christmas tree, yet they have a beautiful home.**

This might be subjective because my family makes less than 20k a year but that house does not look like it's inhabited by people that can't afford a Christmas tree and/or Christmas decorations. On the contrary, Sam's house looked a lot more appropriate for the storyline.

So I am assuming that house was left to them by Marley's dad when her parents divorced (I'm assuming her parents are separated).",,False,self,t5_2royn,False,,,True,t3_14ybmb,http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/14ybmb/while_i_enjoyed_glee_actually_i_have_to_point_out/,

In season 1 posts, the comments were sparse, but still had positive comments for the most parts. In season 2 posts, again, not as many comments, and mostly positive comments about the episode. Season three posts absolutely floored me. I felt like I was wading through giant walls of negative text just to see a positive one. this came as a shock to me, because I thought season 3 was really good. I had no idea so many people hated season 3.  I don't know if it's because all the negative nancys left this subreddit, or just flat out stopped watching the show,  but the negativity towards the show decreased somewhat on this subreddit during season 4's run. I thought that season 4 had a lot more to bitch and moan about. Sorry this was such a big rant, I was just shocked a lot of the negativity of the show wasn't just in season 4.

tl;dr: People on the subreddit can be some cynical bitches.

I'm just sitting here watching old Glee episodes, mainly Regionals from Season 3, and the pain of Cory's death is more alive in my heart right now than it was 3 weeks ago.  During the final song of their performance, when Finn us up in the balcony and Rachel is down on the stage, and they lock eyes and smile... It overwhelms me with so many emotions.  Like so many Glee fans, I fell in love with the characters and the relationships they developed over the course of 4 seasons.  I know these people.  I can relate to these people.  Hearing about their real life struggles just makes their character on the show touch me even more.  Hearing anyone lose their battle with drugs is hard, but hearing about Cory losing his battle, I felt like I lost a piece of myself.  Is that dumb?  Is it stupid to lose yourself so deeply in a show that when something happens to the actor it tears you apart?  I don't think I'll ever be able to watch an episode of Glee where I won't cry.  I feel angry that his last season was spent away from Rachel -- even though that's silly.  I feel so incredibly sad for Lea, and for everyone that he touched.  Usually when someone dies from a drug overdose, you hear a lot of negative stuff about them.  But with Cory, you only hear about how much of an amazing, genuine person he was.

I didn't want to post this on the official Cory thread because it hasn't been active in a few weeks and I'm just looking for support.  We need to lean on each other during this time, even if it sounds silly.  Season 5 will be airing before we know it, and it's going to be an incredibly hard time for everyone.

As most of this subreddit knows, Finn won't be appearing in the final two episodes due to Cory's checking into rehab.
