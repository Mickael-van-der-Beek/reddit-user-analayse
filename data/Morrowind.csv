I had my last day of school last friday and will end my apprenticeship on the 31st of December.


So yeah, come January 1st I'm going to celebrate my new freedom by visiting some countries (Germany, England, Scotland and Iceland).


This means that I will no longer have the chance to contribute at least one post a day for this wonderful subreddit.


This is of course no goodbye forever - plans can change, maybe I come back earlier, maybe I still have the chance to contribute every now and then. 
However, by no later than May, I will be back anyway.


I hope the mods allow this self-post. I just want you guys to know that I'm not dead or anything if I no longer post here, and that I will come back! ;)


Cheers,

In this subreddit, we often stated that there will always be one more secret nobody has seen or discovered before, but I think I reached that part now. Morrowind holds **nothing** for me anymore.

If you browse /r/morrowind frequently, you surely have noticed that my OC in the last couple of weeks started to lose it's originality and passion my first submissions had. 
I on the other hand noticed that I started to open Morrowind just for the sake of finding something to post on /r/Morrowind way too much lately. And that's simply not the point of the game and this subreddit.

So I came to the conclusion that I will no longer post OC on this subreddit. Before I made my first post in /r/Morrowind I promised myself to end on a high point of my ""career"" and that I won't force unoriginal OC just for the sake of delivering.

I hope that this post doesn't make me look like a self-centered/pretentious guy, I mainly made this post because someone asked me why I stopped submitting daily OC, and I thought a ""public announcement"" would be best to prevent any confusion.

I would like to close this post by thanking everyone for your honesty and kind words concerning my submissions - I upvoted every single comment of you guys. This has always been my one and only subreddit (next to /r/shittyTESlore) and I'm really happy I got to know and appreciate every single one of you. I think there has never been a huge drama or a troll in /r/Morrowind, which proves again that this remains the best subreddit!

When I was about 12 I played morrowind everyday. This was the best time of my life, before relationships, money, jobs, or sex ever had an influence on me. Most important of all, before my parents divorced. One of the main things that stuck with me was the sound track, all you all know, music can really bring up nostalgia. At this time I got my dog, Taz. He was just a puppy and now I'm 19 he's old and tired. 
Today I was checking out some bands on YouTube and had a familiar tune in my head. I search the morrowind sound track and listen to the while thing, as I'm listening I glance at Taz laying right beside me. I notice all the changes in my life and his between now and when I was 12, and for some reason I just fucking breakdown crying. Such euphoria was created that it brought up every amazing and worst moment of my life between now and then. Just wanted to give this back to the community, hope it was appreciated. I hope I always remember and treasure this feeling the soundtrack gives me.

I haven't played Morrowind in years myself, and eventually I modified my installation so much it wasn't a game anymore, so much as a testing platform.  Anyway, there were mainly three of us that made the mod, Zenorf, Fariel, and me. (I went by ""Neuman"" back then)  I remember we did most of the work in 2003 and 2004, so I guess that was over eight years ago.  I still see all the flaws in our models, from the screenshots you guys are posting, and feel like I need to go back and fix them or something.  They're still better than the original models (shudder), but there's certainly room for improvement.

Anyway, these days, I've been trying to finish grad school, developing medical simulators through the University of Buffalo Virtual Reality Lab.  It was pretty cool, because I never really thought I'd use all that 3D Studio Max knowledge.  But the fact that I'm a biomedical engineer with a modicum of artistic ability, makes my skill set ideal for virtual reality medical simulation.  So if anyone else out there is (or was) interested in being a game developer too, just a heads up: try looking into virtual reality development, since the skill set is very similar, and it's a lot less competitive.  The pay is probably better too.

So, anyone here remember us or our Psychodog Studios website?

(""Neuman"" -&gt; ""New Man"" -[poorly translated into Latin]-&gt; ""Vir Novus"".  It's hard to come up with a username that other people on sites you like, don't also use.)

[Here are the Better Bodies source files, that were hosted on the Psychodog Studios site before it went down because I was broke and stopped paying for it.](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&amp;authuser=0#folders/0B1PG3N4YjxL0Tjc5VXRmWHg3Wm8)

Someone asked how this mod came about, and this was my answer:

&gt; Originally, the bodies were broken into segments, like marionettes.  Each part was a static object, meaning that it didn't bend as the body moved.  The only parts that could deform were the chest and the hands, and everything else was essentially wooden.  [Picture for comparison between our models and the original ones.](http://i.imgur.com/U9Zu9.jpg)

&gt; Originally, I tried to make clothes and armor mods, but the body made that very difficult.  Still, I released ""Neuman's Black Leather"", in which I tried to add some stuff like shorter skirts or whatever for the female characters, because there was a lot of demand among modders for that type of model.  It frustrated me that the clothes models couldn't fit on top of the body models, so it was impossible to make low-cut shirts, or anything that went lower than the neck, since any shirt-type clothing would replace the entire chest model.  It was also impossible to have short-sleeved shirts, or most types of clothing that would show skin through them.  I ended up inventing racial scripts, which required you to make like eight copies of any given item.  When you picked up an item in the game, the script would replace it with one appropriate for your character's race.  I didn't like that solution, but a lot of other people ended up using it for clothing and armor, because there was no other choice.

&gt; Eventually, when I was messing around with different models in 3D Studio Max, I realized that you could create a single NIF file (Morrowind's 3D model format), and have multiple models within that file.  That's not how the original character modeler did it, but that would be the *correct* way to do it using the engine they had.  (Later I found out that the character modeler was the wife of one of their top developers.  She wasn't very good at her job, but she was very nice and everyone at Bethesda liked her.  Eh.)  Anyway, from there, I realized that you could make a body model all in one piece, break it up into the various parts (chest, upper arm, foot, etc.) within 3D Studio Max, and then configure each body part to pull in the correct part of the model.

&gt; In case you can't tell, this would make it exponentially easier to create a continuous, non-marionette-looking body.  I pulled a body model from some 3D model repository, and attached it to a character, then posted it on Bethesda's forums, with the title ""Better body models?""  I hadn't really expected that to turn into a mod, I was just expecting to show other people how it could be done.  But the title of the thread stuck as a name.

&gt; I was kind of fumbling around and was learning as I went, but eventually, I improved a bit on the crappy model I started with.  Another modder, Nightstrider, offered to do the skin textures, and she set up a forum on her website (subtlelucidity, I'd be shocked if anyone remembered *those* forums).  There, another modder, Zenorf, showed up and started subtly mocking my efforts to fix the bodies.  A whole bunch of the other members got really pissed at him, and I was a bit pissed too, since I didn't want to be wasting my effort if someone else could do this better.  Anyway, we talked, and agreed that there was no sense in duplicating our efforts, so we all moved to the Psychodog Studios forums, and so on.

&gt; So yeah, that's pretty much how this mod was started.

As, for what I've been doing since then, I graduated with an engineering degree in 2006, then worked at a few really boring engineering jobs, until I decided to go back to grad school.  There, I got involved in the University of Buffalo's [Virtual Reality Lab](http://www.vrlab.buffalo.edu) where I got involved with designing medical simulators for training surgeons to use surgical robots.  I'm working commercializing that simulator now, at [Simulated Surgical Systems, a company in Lancaster, New York.](http://www.simulatedsurgicals.com/)  It's cool, because of all the engineers I work with, I'm the only one that has any experience with the artistic side of 3D modeling.  Also, my experience with Better Bodies is how I learned to use 3D Studio Max, which we're now using to model the parts of the surgical robot, as well as human organs, for our simulator.

I'm not sure what all questions anyone would want to ask me, but ask away.  Since this subreddit is a bit small, I'll check back every few hours for questions, but I'll answer any I get.  Certainly for the weekend, anyway.  I'll keep checking back here every so often, though I may not be able to every day if I'm busy.",,False,,t5_2r9nv,1367286520.0,,,True,t3_16wna5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/16wna5/iama_maker_of_the_morrowind_mod_better_bodies_ama/,

---

**Why Vanilla?** 

---

Because, vanilla Morrowind is *fantastic*.  It is flawed and the graphics are outdated, but it is an experience like no other.  It has more atmosphere than the later Elder Scrolls titles, and I feel was the most -complete- Elder Scrolls game out of the box, without resorting to mods. 


---

**I've tried vanilla Morrowind.  It's not for me.**

---

Install [Morrowind Overhaul 3.0](http://www.ornitocopter.net/morrowind-overhaul/) and look on the web for recommended mods.  This guide is not for you.

---

**Which version should I get?**

---

The Steam version is certainly the easier route.  However, I am someone that prefers to have the disc versions of games, if possible.  I would suggest looking for the GOTY disc version, and settle for the Steam version.  This guide is for GOTY disc version users, but applies fine to Steam users as well.

---

**Installing Morrowind**

---

*Quick Version*

For the GOTY / Steam version, you will not need to use any of the patches, just install.  For others, please follow this installation order:

Morrowind &gt; Tribunal &gt; [Tribunal v1.4.1313 Patch](http://download.zenimax.com/elderscrolls/morrowind/patches/tribunal_v1.4.1313.exe) &gt; Bloodmoon &gt; [Bloodmoon v1.6.1820 Patch](http://download.zenimax.com/elderscrolls/morrowind/patches/Bloodmoon_v1.6.1820.exe)

Install Morrowind to a root directory (e.g. C:\Morrowind, D:\Morrowind). This saves you some headaches later on and makes it easy to access.  Go ahead and install the Construction Set when it asks you to, and let it try to install the Direct-X 8.1 runtime.

---

**(Optional) Install the official mods**

---

These mods are by Bethesda themselves, so I consider them a part of ""vanilla"" Morrowind.  Many people do not, however, so this is entirely up to you. 

[Download the official mods here](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Official_Plug-ins).

To install the mods, open up your Morrowind directory, and navigate to the Data Files folder (in my case - C:\Morrowind\Data Files) - for all of the mods except Firemoth, extract the contents of the .zip files into this folder.  For the Firemoth mod, open the .zip, navigate into the Data Files folder inside the .zip, and extract the contents of that file into your Morrowind Data Files folder.

**Be sure to activate these mods** - run the Morrowind Launcher, select 'Data Files' and tick the checkbox next to each of the mods that you just installed.  Click OK and exit the launcher.

---

**(Optional) Enable Pixel Shaders (improved water)**

---

Run the Morrowind Launcher and select ""Options"".  Enable Pixel Shading.  Water will be greatly improved, at the cost of some FPS (your mileage may vary).  I always have this disabled as I find the pixel shaded water to look way too out of place compared to the default water.  This is all preference, though.

---

**Install Patches/Fixes**

---

**Morrowind FPS Optimizer**

[Download](http://www.lowgenius.net/post/2008/05/23/Morrowind-FPS-Optimizer.aspx#.UQYTx7_a8q8)

This is the FPS optimizer.  It can be used to allow widescreen resolutions and custom Field of View options.  This is not going to be used to improve the graphics of the game, but make it so you can view the game in a proper resolution.  It can help you improve your FPS if you are on a limited system as well.

Open the .zip, extract this to your Morrowind directory.  Create a shortcut of this .exe and send it to your desktop.  This will be your primary launcher in the future.

Run mw_fps_opt.exe - uncheck ""novice mode"".  Click ""change Morrowind registry settings here"" and set your native resolution.  

Next, go to the ""view"" tab and uncheck all of the boxes here.  You can tinker with these later if you have FPS issues.  

Next, click the ""misc/2"" tab and change the FOV and aspect ratio.  [Here](http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/750px-vector_video_standards2.png) is a good chart for aspect ratio.  For FOV, I generally float between 90 and 95, but your mileage my vary depending on your preferences. 

Continuing, go to the ""n/patch"" tab and uncheck all of the boxes here (yes, all of them - right click and choose ""select all"", then right click again and click ""disable selected"").  This gets rid of the annoying ""object popping"" that the FPS optimizer comes with.  

Close FPS optimizer and continue with the guide.

*As a side note, if you have poor FPS:* Re-enable the boxes that were enabled on the ""view"" tab.  It's unlikely that you'll have to do this, but in the event that you do (netbook, integrated graphics, etc), these settings are highly useful.  You can use the middle mouse scroll wheel to adjust the view distance dynamically, and it will change the view distance automatically depending on your FPS - you can set your desired minimum FPS here as well.

**Morrowind Code Patch**

[Download](http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/19510)

This is probably the most important step.  Open the code patch's .zip file and extract everything to your Morrowind directory.  Run the ""Morrowind Code Patch.exe"" in administrator mode (just in case, for Windows Vista, 7, 8 users) by right clicking the file and selecting ""Run as Administrator"".  

I recommend just using the default options if you're not familiar with the game, but some options that I choose that are not selected by default are:

* Loud interface sounds fix
* Swift casting (highly recommended)
* Shortcut key improvements (this is a preference thing)
* Unrestrict menu size
* Permanent barter disposition change (highly recommended)
* Racial variation in speed fix
* On-use ring extra slot

When done choosing your options, click Apply chosen patches and close when done.

**4GB Patch**

[Download](http://www.ntcore.com/4gb_patch.php)

You only need this if you have 4GB or more of RAM, using a 64-bit operating system.  Extract the 4gb_patch exe to the Morrowind root directory.  Right click the exe and select ""Run as Administrator"" (for Vista, 7, 8 users).  Select the Morrowind.exe file and run the patch.

**EXE Optimizer**

[Download](http://timeslip.users.sourceforge.net/exeopt.html)

To extract this, download [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) and use it to extract this file.  Once extracted to the Morrowind root directory, right click ""exeOpt.exe"" and click ""Run as Administrator"" (for Vista, 7, 8 users).  Click the ""Benchmarker"" tab and uncheck ""Benchmark patches"" (I've found this option to cause some errors).  Go back to the ""Main"" tab and select ""Find Morrowind manually"".  Navigate to your Morrowind folder and select it.  Then, click ""Patch Morrowind"".  When it's finished, exit the program.

**BTB's Morrowind Patch**

[Download](http://btb2.free.fr/morrowind.html)

Extract the contents of this archive into your Morrowind directory (in my case C:\Morrowind\).  Be sure to copy and replace any files that require overwriting.

Go back to the Morrowind directory, run the Launcher.  Select Data Files and be sure that the ""Morrowind Patch v1.6.5 Beta (BTB Edit).esm""  file is selected.  If not, enable its checkbox and click OK.

---

**(Optional) Tweak the Morrowind.ini file**

---

The Morrowind.ini is in your Morrowind base directory. * BE SURE TO MAKE A COPY OF THIS FIRST.* You can follow this guide's .ini settings if you wish:

[Morrowind Tweak Guide (highly outdated)](http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/316/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_tweak_guide/index5.html)

This is the system I play Morrowind on most, my 2013 13"" Macbook Pro:
i5-3210M @ 2.5GHz
4GB DDR3 RAM
Intel HD4000 Integrated Graphics
Windows 7 x64

Here are some of the .ini tweaks that I use consistently, tweaked to my system:

    Show FPS=1
    Max FPS=60
    Screen Shot Enable=1
    ThreadPriority=0
    Interior Cell Buffer=64
    Exterior Cell Buffer=128

    [LightAttenuation]
    UseConstant=1
    ConstantValue=0.382
    ;
    UseLinear=1
    LinearMethod=1
    LinearValue=0.15
    LinearRadiusMult=1.0
    ;
    UseQuadratic=1
    QuadraticMethod=2
    QuadraticValue=2.5
    QuadraticRadiusMult=1.15	
    ;
    OutQuadInLin=0
    
    [Weather Rain]
    Rain Diameter=1200
    Max Raindrops=1500
    
    [Weather Thunderstorm]
    Rain Diameter=1200
    Max Raindrops=3000
    
    [Weather Snow]
    Snow Diameter=1600
    Max Snowflakes=1500


... and that's about it.  I don't like to change anything else, really.

---

**(Optional) In-Game Settings**

---

When in the game, go to the Options menu.  Here are my suggestions for changes:

*Prefs Tab*

* Always Use Best Attack: On (uses the weapon's best attack)

* AI Distance: Far (Shows NPC movement smoothly from a distance, turn down if you have FPS problems)

*Video Tab*

* View Distance: Far (Lower if you have FPS problems.  This is highly FPS intensive)

* Gamma Correction: 35% (This goes well with my lighting settings in the INI section above)

*Controls Tab*

Customize your controls here.  I recommend setting Jump to spacebar or something and setting Activate to E (swap them). Jump is usually spacebar, no?  I like to set the Quick Menu to Q (similar to Skyrim) and Ready Magic to R (use Swift Casting from the Code Patch to make it so you can cast with a weapon out).

---

**Run the game!**

---

Run the game using the FPS optimizer.  Click Launch Morrowind when you run it.  Enjoy!

Read up on the game.  Bookmark [UESP](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind).  You'll need it.  The levelling system is a bit wonky, but if you've played Oblivion, you know what you're doing basically.

---

**Changelog**

---

*1.0 - Initial version added to Reddit*

*1.1 - Replaced Unofficial Morrowind Patch with BTB's Patch and added FPS Optimizer additional info*

However, I didn't stop there. I also went through the ""miscellaneous"" voice files that are typically related to a quest. And whenever I found an interesting file, I converted it into video format. I have now uploaded these videos to Youtube for your viewing/listening pleasure.

I compiled two Youtube playlists. [**The first playlist**](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbT9IIZv0qyIMKBW925nkrh91XhYV32lT) is completely spoiler-free and features the following words:

So I want to do a heavily researched play-through of Morrowind with more of a focus on individual towns, villages and characters rather than the overall general lore of the elder scrolls games.

So my question is would you have any interest for this? I don't want to make it like a history lesson so the skill will be in picking and choosing facts that are interesting, while also having some humour in the play-through. But I by no means want to make it anything similar to the likes of Toby Turner or PewDiePie. (Even though I see why they are popular)

I also want to mention that I want to include enough information so then people who have already played the game gain something from it. I will go down a very planned route of gameplay and not be too general in what I do. This is so then others who are inspired to play the game can go down their own completely different route.

Also has anyone else done something similar to this with Morrowind?

Thanks! =]

EDIT 1 - If you're going to downvote please tell me why, I want constructive feedback.

EDIT 2 - It seems a fair number of you would like this to happen! I can't actually find any videos of people playing through Morrowind and giving lots of information about aspects of the game either. So I will definitely go ahead with this! I want to do it properly so I am unsure as of now when I'll upload the first espisode, but I'll keep this sub-reddit informed.

To me, I see this as a unique opportunity to have a Fallout-esque setting in an Elder Scrolls game, where you are exploring a ruined wasteland, although Vvardenfell was fairly scarred from the start. 

Still, exploring the ruins of Vivec and maybe searching for clues of where the Nerevarine went would be pretty cool. That being said, it's hard to imagine that they would return to an old setting prior to exploring everything that's currently laid out, although an expansion wouldn't be out of the question I think.

In any case, what do you Seras think about the idea of returning to the ruined continent of Vvardenfell and, if not, where would you prefer to see the next game take you to?

I really can't think of any other game with a fanbase this faithful, so I wanted to ask you guys and girls some ""personal"" questions. It would be wonderful to have a little discussion.

I am aware that some of these questions may have been asked before, but coherent with the other questions they may lead to other, more specific answers.

1. Was Morrowind your first Elder Scrolls game? 

2. Was Morrowind your first RPG?

3. How did you discover Morrowind?

4. Do you still play the game (sporadically/frequently) or do you ""just"" wallow in memories?

5. Has Morrowind influenced the way you play other TES games? (Character is Dunmer, the Nerevarine, lived during the events of the Nerevarine Prophecy, etc.)

6. What are your thoughts when you hear the Morrowind theme? Do you listen to it while reading, learning, working out or have you set it as your alarm-clock?

7. How has Morrowind influenced your life? Or didn't it have it any influence at all? 

EDIT: 6./8. Is Morrowind your favorite game? If no, which game(s) do you think is better than it?

This isn't necessarily bad, seeing as this is one of the better places for Morrowind advice, but it does bring up the fact that we are seeing less content related to playing the game. 

What I'd like to propose are some ideas to spice things up:

* Weekly challenges - Each week, a new challenge would be given. Not necessarily something like ""beat X quest"", rather something like ""steal a gondolier's helmet without killing the gondolier"" or something like that. A possibility is that everyone who completes it gets custom flair. /r/kerbalspaceprogram has a similar thing, and it seems like it could work here.

* Creative contests - Each week or so, collect the best pictures/songs/stories made by the community and put them in a showcase for everyone to vote on.

* Mod contests - Every so often, give a starting point for a mod, be it a category (""house mod""), or a part of the game to expand on (""create a backstory for Arlowe and the BanHammer""), and give people a certain, relatively short, time period to make a related mod. This might be less of a competition, and hopefully give some new guys a chance to get their feet wet.

What do you folks think? Certainly all of the ideas can be changed, and I'll be happy to help implement any that gain traction.",,False,,t5_2r9nv,False,,ThievesGuildFlair,True,t3_11i4qn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/11i4qn/meta_various_ideas_to_spice_up_rmorrowind/,

A short while ago I posted a thread asking what people's favorite lesser known were. After reading over the thread and looking at all the great mods people recommended, I decided to compile a list of those mods with the mods I consider ""essential"" along with a few others. Before anybody starts downloading mods they should be sure to play the vanilla game. In its vanilla form Morrowind is an amazing game. It's ability to be easily modded has allowed it live on. **Make sure you play the vanilla game before you mod it.** This way you can better decide which mods appeal to you and which ones do not as well as allow you to better appreciate the wonderful game Bethesda made for you.

---

###Graphical

##Morrowind Overhaul Sound and Graphics
This mod is best graphical mod for the game. It comes with the latest version of the Morrowind Patch Project and the Morrowind Code Patch. It also includes numerous graphical updates to the games meshes and textures and includes the Morrowind Graphics Extender. The Graphics Extender is very resource needy and the higher setting offered by this mod require a fairly powerful computer, but there are numerous options which allow it to run fairly well on more dated machines. It comes with an easy to use installer which streamlines the instillation process. Make sure that you uncheck the animated container option during the installation. Download links are on www.ornitocopter.net.

##Westly's Pluginless Head Replacer
This pluginless head replacer made by Westly replaces the vanilla heads with updated one's that stay truer to the originals than those included in the overhaul. It does not replace the Imperial, Dunmer, or Beast Race Heads however. The changes made by this mod will overwrite those of the overhaul. If you do not want the changes to particular race to be overwritten, then don't drag the the meshes and textures that apply to that race into your data files. The meshes and textures are all named in a manner that allows you to differentiate which ones apply to which race and gender which makes this much easier. Screenshots: http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/8104/picwestly1.jpg, http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9708/picwestly2.jpg, http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6937/picwestly3.jpg. Download here: http://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/westlys-pluginless-head-replacer.

##Poorly Placed Object Fix
The version of this mod included in the overhaul is messed up in certain areas. Download this version and extract the esm file from this version and replace the one included in the Overhaul with it. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=9197

###Bug Fixes/Gameplay Tweaks

##Delayed Dark Brotherhood Attacks
This mod makes the introduction of the Tribunal expansion much more realistic. No longer will a random prisoner be attacked by assassins in the dead of night. This mod delays the Dark Brotherhood's attacks on the player until he has gained much notoriety in the land of Morrowind either by being proclaimed Nerevarine or being made leader of a major guild or great house. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=2487

##Illy's Solstheim Rumor Fix
Normally everybody and their uncle knows about the island of Solstheim in Morrowind and every imperial has a son there. This can be slightly immersion breaking. This fixes that by making so, only select people have knowledge of the island. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=8471

##Frostmoth Repaired
This mod repairs Fort Frostmoth as the Bloodmoon main quest progresses. Scaffolding and whatnot appear as the fort is rebuilt. It's a simple and great little mod that everybody should check out. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=4704

##Hospitality Papers
Hospitality Papers were supposed to be required to engage in any services in Sadrith Mora, but it was not implemented into the game. This mod corrects that and makes them necessary. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=7034

##Protective Guards
The guards in Morrowind will bravely defend you against a rat, but they won't bat an eye if a raging Dark Brotherhood Assassin is chasing you through town. This mod fixes this. Now guards will defend you from attacking NPCs as long as you did not commit a crime first. This mod requires the Morrowind Script Extender. The Morrowind Script Extender is built into MGE, so if you are using the Morrowind Overhaul you need not worry about this. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=6006

##Shut Up!
This mod makes it so that NPCs will only greet you if you look at them. You can now walk through the streets without being constantly yelled at. This mod requires the Morrowind Script Extender. The Morrowind Script Extender is built into MGE, so if you are using the Morrowind Overhaul you need not worry about this. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=7705

##Arrow De-nocker
This plugin allows you to de-nock your arrow. TThis mod requires the Morrowind Script Extender. The Morrowind Script Extender is built into MGE, so if you are using the Morrowind Overhaul you need not worry about this. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=7238

##Nastier Camonna Tong
This mod gives the Camonna Tong more insulting greetings. Racial slurs and all are included in this mod. When you download this mod makes sure to change the name of the ""sounds"" file to ""sound"" before you drag it's contents into your Data Files folder, or you will get some errors. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=209240&amp;id=9040

##Oblivion Style Vampires
Excerpts from author's description: ""With this plugin you will progress through four stages of the disease, (day by day) getting more powerful as each day goes on, but you will also take more sun damage, more fire damage, and upon reaching the fourth stage, NPCs will know you are a vampire, and react appropriately. Feeding on the living brings this back to the first stage. You will be able to do all story quests, barter, stay at inns, and do everything you normally would, while being a vampire. Essentially makes vampires function like they do in Oblivion. Does not overpower.

##Random Passive Cliffracers
Few can deny that cliffracers are the most annoying creatures in Vvardenfell. They are not tough, but they attack often and in great numbers. This makes traversing the ashy regions of Morrowind more annoying than need be. This mod corrects this issue by adding passive cliffracers to Morrowind's leveled lists. This means that not all of the randomly generated cliffracers that you encounter will be hostile. This lessens the frequency of their attacks without messing up their place in Morrowind's lore.

##Galsiah's Character Development or MADD Leveler
These are two different mods that alter Morrowind's leveling system. **They are *not* compatible!** Both of these mods attempt to remove the min/maxing nature of Morrowind's leveling system, but approach it in different ways. GCD does this by making skills alter health, magicka, fatigue, and attributes directly. It also streamlines leveling by removing the level up menu altogether. By design this mod favors pure warriors, thieves, and mages. Mixed classes suffer during GCD's use. MADD Leveler (my favorite of the two) improves Morrowind's leveling system by making all the level up bonus abilities to x1 (rather than x5 regardless of skill point gains), and gives you an attribute point every time you raise three skills controlled by that attribute. The mod also contains numerous addons that remove the skill cap among other things. More detailed descriptions of both mods can be found in their respective readmes. I recommend MADD over GCD, but you should investigate both, so you can make the most educated decision. Download GCD here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=2030 and Madd here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=5316

##Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod
They Morrowind normally calculates health forces the player to beef up their endurance in the beginning regardless of class. With this mod installed the health now is equal to ( (Strength + Endurance) / 2 ) + ( ( Endurance / 10 ) x ( Level - 1 ) ). This means that fortify endurance potions are now useful, and increasing your endurance early on is no longer necessary. It is still very important to getting the maximum number hp, but when you increase your endurance has no sway over your health at later levels.  **Do *not* use this with GCD!** The mod is compatible with MADD Leveler however and it is highly recommended that you use the two mods together.

###Make sure to read all readme's before installing any of the above mods. All are compatible with each other. Be sure to run the Mlox utility included in the Morrowind Overhaul to ensure that the mods are sorted into the proper order. It is recommended that these be used on a new game. Some of them may work on an old game, but some will not. If there is anything that needs clarified or that you think I should include please let me know.

1368718695.0,81,self.Morrowind,1egf2t,The Red Mountain Run,Eventt,82,1,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1egf2t/the_red_mountain_run/,"People of /r/morrowind! I hereby challenge you to complete a little something I call the Red Mountain Run. It involves running. For your life.

The basic idea is to create a new character, teleport to Ghostgate with the console and then run all the way to the southern entrance of Kogoruhn and then through the fortress to its roof. Preferably without dying.

**Detailed rundown of the challenge:**

1. Begin by creating a new character. You can't take anything from the Seyda Neen Census and Excise offices apart from the package and the 87 gold Sellus Gravius gives you. Teleport to Ghostgate immediately after exiting the offices. The console command for teleporting there is

        coc ""Ghostgate, Temple""

 If you for some reason can't or don't want to use the console, I guess you'll just have to walk. But you're not allowed to interact with the world before arriving at Ghostgate (apart from silt striders etc.), you'll just have to sort of pretend you used teleportation.

 I suggest you make a manual save here in case you want to retry the challenge with a different character. You can use the console command

        enablestatreviewmenu

 to effectively create a new character. This way you won't have to work your way through the tutorial again and again.

2. Once at Ghostgate, it's time to equip yourself for a very long and dangerous journey. By any means you deem necessary. Your task is more important than anything the warriors at Ghostgate have ever done. Note that Ghostgate is the only location you're allowed to visit before venturing inside the Ghostfence so make sure to do everything you can to prepare. (Bonus points for not stealing anything. Even more bonus points for not preparing at all.)

3. Once you feel like you're done with your preparations, it's time to leave the safety of the fortress and head inside the Ghostfence. Once inside, you can no longer leave the area bounded by the Ghostfence. However, you're free to enter any location *inside* the Ghostfence, so if you for example feel like grabbing Sunder or Keening, you can go right ahead.

4. Your first goal is to reach the ""secret"" entrance to Kogoruhn located northwest of Dagoth Ur. Feel free to look it up on a [map](http://www.uesp.net/maps/mwmap/mwmap.shtml?locx=25088&amp;locy=78976&amp;zoom=15) before you begin.

5. Upon entering Kogoruhn, you'll be attacked by **AN ASH VAMPIRE. AVOID HIM. SERIOUSLY. RUN!** (Bonus points for not running.)

6. Your ultimate goal now is to reach the (relative) safety of Kogoruhn's top level (roof). Whereas the creatures in the Red Mountain region level with you, the ones in Kogoruhn don't. At least not all of them. Expect to be one-hitted by pretty much anything encountered in there. In other words, RUN!

7. If you do manage to finally reach the roof, take a screenshot of your character rejoicing his or her survival atop Kogoruhn. Congratulations, you've now completed the Red Mountain Run!

**(TL;DR)** And there you have it. Simple as that. Create a new character, teleport to Ghostgate, get some supplies and then run for your dear life until you're out of Kogoruhn. (Note: You can't outrun the cliff racers. Be prepared.)

**But Eventt, there's no way that can be done!**

Being the good sport that I am, I have already completed this challenge myself with a Redguard scout called The Runner. His tale can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/jC5xt). I accidentally even managed to do it without dying and on my first go as well. I did have to nick some glass gear from the armorer though, so there's plenty of room for improvement.

**One final note:** During my own successful attempt, I tried to keep track of how many enemies attacked me. However, once I encountered the denizens of Kogoruhn I kind of panicked and simply forgot about it. I just ran.

So, here are all the various enemies that attacked me before I even reached Kogoruhn:

 * 4 Ash Slaves
 * 4 Blighted rats
 * 3 Corprus Stalkers
 * **18 cliff racers**

I'd played it once before about 9 or 10 years ago but never gave it the effort it deserves.   

So far I'm a couple weeks in, and the story / setting has me sucked in...

I'm a big fan of the series (played both Skryim and Oblivion extensively) but Morrowind is the best imo... So much depth!

I know this has been said before, but I thought I'd throw this out there to encourage more gamers to give it a go.  It may be a bit outdated but if you can get past the graphics it really is a fantastic game.

Just how much do enemies scale with your level in Morrowind? To test this, I ran around the Red Mountain region with two different characters and kept track of all the enemies that attacked me. [This](http://i.imgur.com/H4aYXtg.png) was my exact route on both times. ([In-game map.](http://i.imgur.com/3VE7kJn.png))

The route starts and ends inside Ghostgate, and I ran the route clockwise. I also made the characters' speeds equal.

**The results:**

**Test subject 1:** [Morra](http://i.imgur.com/RXIu7rP.jpg), a level 1 Argonian was attacked by:

 * 7 Rats

 * 9 Corprus Stalkers

 * 4 Ash Slaves

 * 2 Scamps

 * 1 Mudcrab and

 * 17 Cliff Racers.

40 creatures all in all. Quite a lot for a level 1 character, but they're all low-level enemies. In case you're wondering why a level 1 weakling is wielding a Daedric Bow, it's simply because I wanted to get rid of my attackers as soon as possible.

**Test subject 2:** [Rathir](http://i.imgur.com/IhXtTHo.jpg), a level 60 Dunmer was attacked by:

 * 3 Corprus Stalkers

 * 4 Ash Slaves

 * 1 Mudcrab

 * 19 Cliff Racers

 * 3 Lame Corpruses

 * 4 Ash Zombies

 * 1 Shalk

 * 8 Ash Ghouls

 * 3 Ogrim Titans

 * 3 Hungers

 * 1 Clannfear

 * 1 Flame Atronach

 * 1 Dremora

 * 1 Daedroth and finally

 * 4 Ascended Sleepers.

57 creatures, many of them pretty damn high-level. [The Mudcrab](http://i.imgur.com/7sNc5Q8.jpg) was at [the same exact spot](http://i.imgur.com/qulfezG.jpg) on both times. I should also mention that neither of our two guinea pigs had visited the Red Mountain region before.

And there we have it. The enemies actually scale quite a bit with the PC's level, more than I personally would've expected. At least it's not as noticeable as in, say, Oblivion, but I'm still personally opposed to it. I just don't like it. At all.

He doesn't speak in the large ham stereotypically evil and twisted voice. His goal isn't total destruction of the mortal plane like Mehrunes Dagon or Alduin. He's simply a person driven mad with his lust for power, corrupted by that which he could not control.

The way he greets you when you go to confront him is somewhat disarming in how charming he seems. The way he gives you an honest choice to join him (even though there's no way to accept in the unmodded game).

I'd love to see that in more games - charismatically 'evil' antagonists, rather than straight up megalomaniac evil dudes. A guy who will give you a chance to join him, and genuinely means it.

So I had to spread the news, at least one of you might get some more of your moneys worth out Skyrim, so without further dribble I'll get to the point.

~prerequisites~

- [Boss](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6) - Any modder should know these, I'm not covering them in the submission.

- [Wrye Bash](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1840)

- [Unofficial patch](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19)

-  [Skyrim Script Extender](http://skse.silverlock.org/)

~Scaling and difficulty~

-  [Morrowloot](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19353) - This is the backbone to our installation, just look at that description!

- [Deadly Combat](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5485) - makes stamina crucial to winning, and winning with stamina is still a challenge. Use this alongside [ASIS](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18436) for some enemy potion and spell usage for some more stat based combat. 

-  [Frostfall](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163) - An amazing addition, adds an entire level of hazard to the environment just like the blight! You will find yourself avoiding rain, snow and rivers just like IRL. Choose hardcore as it stops fast travel and such, don't worry camping is very simple and warming up happens even easier than you would think. I like to save only when warm at a fire now, it's very much like Dark Souls and stops F5 abuse.

-  [ASIS-Encounter Zones](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18436) - yea I mentioned this mod earlier, they don't need one or another to run though and its hidden away. This makes different areas harder than others, you know, like Bitter Coast &lt; Red Mountain.
  
-  [Mighty Magick](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13166/) - Mark and recall + good balancing for deadly combat.

-  [Harder Lockpicking](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7395) and [More Locked Containers](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9829) - Self explanatory.

- Important Misc - [No health + Magica Regen](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16221) - [No Cleared Cell Respawn](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9551) - [Path of Shadows](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10456)

~UI and immersion~

-  [SkyUI](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863) - Well... Duh.

-  [Smaller ipHUD](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16178) - Morrowinds was smaller but you cant have everything.

-  [Compass Tuner](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/912) - Just shut down everything! Except cardinal points of course.

-  [Unique Region Names](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15125) - we all know Morrowinds, I wonder why that is.

- [Better Quest Objectives](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11135) - Crucial, absolutely crucial.

-  [The Choice is yours](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26359) - Screw your family heirlooms, I'm roleplaying!

-  [Book Paper HD](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1618) and [Lore Loading Screens](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21265) - For all us lore nuts.

-  [Alternative Start](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557) - Major complaint is you're dubbed the hero right away, lets stop that. Also I advise starting at an Inn so you get an easy Frostfall configuration.

~World and ascetics~

-  [RCRN](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1875) - makes the world all foggy and mysterious (at least occasionally), sound familiar? Also go pure.

-  [Lanterns All in One](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18916) - Remember to pick an RCRN config!

- [Cart in Every Town](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8434) - Why walk when you can ride?

- [No NPC Greetings](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/746) - It was when a group of drunk angry Nords were glaring silently at my elve casually walking around I realized it was more than just an annoyance remover.

-  [Bards Sing on Request Only](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8842) OUR Hero, OUR Hero, claims a warRIOR'S heart
I TELL you, I TELL you, the DRAGONborn COMES.
 
- [Improved Combat Sounds](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5289),  [Sounds of Nature Redux](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19333) - Do yourself a favor and get these.

- [Realistic Ragdolls](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/601) - you fall at their feet like a sack of potatoes, looks great with [Enhanced Blood Textures](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/60)

- [Bigger Trees](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17168) - Looks magical just like the mushrooms, I'm not using full size though.

- Misc - [Better Snow](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10383) + [HD Texures](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/743), [No Blocky Faces](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30), [The Real Fus Ro Dah](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2973) and finally [Unique Beast Races](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6041) might one day see the light of day.

~Conclusion~

Well that's it so far, I've been subbed here for quite awhile now so I've heard all of the complaints about where the series is heading, not to mention all the really deep things such as: The sense of being in a hostile alien world (story wise), a sense of mystery and several other things I can't quite recall at he moment. All of these growing from pretty fundamental gameplay mechanics, sadly not all will ever be modded in.

With all this in mind I chose these mods resembling the most pure experience while remaining light and still refraining from over saturation of conflicting plugins (I'm looking at you FCOM).

None of these Mods are mine, I didn't have anything to do with them, don't sue me or anything. Also Sorry if this is the wrong sub, it's just that I would have loved to have read this if I were in your shoes.

If you want suggest other mods then I'll add them to the list, suggest stuff as well. Also sorry for not proofreading (as of yet at least, its pretty late).

~Edit~

-  [Guard dialogue overhaul](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23390) - Makes guards recognize who you are, may be obsolete with no comments mod.

-  [Skyrim Redone](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286) - A large overhaul containing lots of lovely things already covered, I'm certain most modules will conflict heavily with what we already have including Morrowloot :( either don't install those mods or just use a few plugins. I'm just using races and standing stones modules.

- [Character Creation Overhaul](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21587) - YEA SPREADSHEETS!

Whenever i say/hear that word i hear the main theme ring throughout my ears. Whenever i say/hear the word i think of how big of an impact that game had on my life. 

When i was younger, and Morrowind had just been released. I had it on xbox and whenever i went to school i would think about what i would do next in the game. I just knew that the moment i got home, i would fight another epic battle, complete a quest, explore a dungeon, and much, much more. I had never seen any game like this before.

My Dad and I had played this game so much that we had races to see who can get to ____ level before the other one as at this time my Dad was Unemployed. He would tell me all he accomplished while i was at school.  

Soon enough we had gotten my uncle into the game. He had his own xbox and was also hardcore into the game like us. 
It was clear that this was our favourite game of all time.

_______________________________________________
Oblivion was released.

We didn't get it until a few years after it was released. Mainly because we didn't have enough money to buy a 360.

This is when my dad had stopped with TES games as he finally had gotten a job and wanted to be blown away with Oblivion as he did with Morrowind. But i continued with Morrowind. I had saved up money for the GoTY version and it sucked MORE hours out of my life with the two new lands to explore and more quests to complete.

When we finally got Oblivion my dad was like ""WOAH!"" and i was like ""WOAH!"".....for the first 2 days. It started going ""meh"" for me after a few days while for my dad it was still ""WOAH!"" I was not satisfied with Oblivion. I 
knew what i wanted, i wanted Morrowind and Oblivion was not Morrowind. Son, i was dissapoint.

_______________________________________________
11.11.11 Skyrim is released

We had gotten it opening night.

My dad was BLOWN AWAY by it. While i thought it was great. But it gradually lost its enjoyment. It felt watered down and not as creative as Morrowind. It remains my dads favourite game of all time.



_______________________________________________
The point is, Morrowind made me a gamer. And it shaped the way i view video games today. It is that one game that let me escape reality for the hours i played it. And for the YEARS i've played it. It still hasn't lost its touch on me. Whenever i bust out Morrowind its a blast of nolstalgia of all the good days playing Morrowind sitting on the floor, eyes glued to the screen. 

To this day Morrowind remains my 2ND favourite game of all time.


TL;DR I tell about memories i had playing Morrowind and how it has made an impact on me. Morrowind made me a gamer.

We all know there are ways to abuse skills, get powerful equipment at low levels, and whatnot, and every so often someone will come along and complain about how completely broken the game is because of this.  My first thought with this sort of thing is, then why do you do it?  OK, maybe a Dark Brotherhood assassin dropping strong armor at your feet at first level is a bit in-your-face and hard to ignore, but no one forces you to blast your Intelligence through the stratosphere and make super-potions or raid some Great House's vaults.

I've only ever done the Alchemy exploit to see it for myself, and I only break into somewhere like the Redoran vaults when it feels appropriate for my character.  I don't even pick up the Sword of White Woe with a new character.

There's a similar issue in Skyrim, with many people going on about Enchanting and Smithing being broken.  Yeah, if you max out the skill you can make some pretty powerful stuff, but I know I've never gotten close to that level.  Of course, I only use the skills when it makes sense to, so no mass production of enchanted iron daggers or anything for the express purpose of getting access to the ""broken"" abilities.

It just seems weird to me when people essentially say ""I went out of my way to do something crazy, and then it was crazy!  How screwed up is that?""  I just want to grab these people and say the game's not broken, the idea that you can grind a skill to an absurd level and not be unbalanced is broken.

Am I alone?  Am I taking crazy pills?",,False,,t5_2r9nv,False,,,True,t3_19gux8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/19gux8/using_exploits_and_then_complaining_about_them/,

So if you ever experience low fps using mods or just in general, the reason is almost guaranteed not your computer! Rather, your pc has multiple cores, and morrowind only uses one, and your computer tries balancing all the power fairly between all of them, so don't get enough processing power.

To fix low fps!

* Open taskmanager while morrowind is running

* Go to the ""processes"" tab, find Morrowind.exe and right click

* Set priority to high, set affinity to one of your computer cores (Make sure only one is chosen!)

* Restart Morrowind and enjoy high fps! :)

So I'm playing as a Dunmer mage, and he is very devout to the Tribunal Temple. Upon arriving in Vvardenfell, I started the Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces for the Temple. most were pretty easy, and after awhile, I was level 5 and done with all of the pilgrimages except for the Shrine of Pride and the Shrine of Valor. I decided to go to the Shrine of Pride inside the Ghostgate first. The journey there was perilous, but I managed to make it despite the hordes of cliff racers. However, I used all of my good magicka restore potions to get there.

After praying at the Shrine, I tried several times to get back, but to no avail. I couldn't buy any good restore magicka potions at the Ghostgate. I couldn't find any Almsivi or Divine intervention scrolls anywhere (and anyway, being devout to the Tribunal meant that there would be no way I would use Divine Intervention), so I was stuck.

I eventually found a way out of the Ghostgate. I realized that I had two items that could get me out:

1) Three Scrolls of Icarian Flight, found on Tarhiel's body

2) Three homemade levitation potions. I walked out of the Ghostgate, and activated a Scroll of Icarian Flight. 

I could use these to jump a long distance, then stop my fall. After two hops (and a worrying encounter with two Cliff Racers), I managed to get to Caldera unharmed!",,False,,t5_2r9nv,False,,,True,t3_1ekulh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1ekulh/just_wanted_to_share_this_story/,

My first Elder Scrolls game was Oblivion. I loved it, a year later Skyrim came and it was a blast. However, even thougj Skyrim felt so alive, it lacked depth. If you play one quest, you've pretty much played them all. Half the characters have no dialogue other then ""yes Dovakiin?"". 

So I decided to finally get Morrowind to try it out and holy cow, I never thought I'd love it so much. Everything you encounter is unique. You never run into the same thing twice. The characters have so much to tell you and it just makes the game so incredibly immersing. I travelled to a town, and there was this big turtle- shaped building. when I entered it, there was an entire city in there O.o. I talked to some guy and he told me it was the shell of some ancient beast. just an example of how amazing and unique this game is compared to Skyrim where every city is made of the same farmhouses.

I love how there's no quest markers and you have to do your own research instead of following the damn arrow. After playing Morrowind, Skyrim and even my precious Oblivion make me feel like a 12 year old. 

I'm completely hooked and fell in love with Morrowind in a few hours would be the point I'm trying to make :)

By this point I was getting pretty sick of being so slow and resolved to go after the Boots of Blinding Speed. Alas, I'd forgotten that I have a 'tougher faction requirements' mod installed; the Mages' Guild refused to transport me.

- The first thing I do after I enter a dark cave is ducking down. I don't know why, but else I wouldn't feel save.

- When the NPCs of Morrowind give me useless armor or other unnecessary stuff for completing a quest, I wait until I am outside of their houses to drop the stuff somewhere so I don't make them feel bad (Yes.)

- When I go to sleep, I make sure to wake up at 7 AM so I have at least 8 hours of sunshine. I hate travelling while it's dark.

- I always steal everything from the daedric shrines, just to make sure I trigger all the Dremoras.

- If I end a game-session, I make sure to be in a pub or in a friendly house to save my data.

EDIT:

- No matter how many gold my character has, I steal every gem I find on my travels.

- After I became a millionare, I usually sell stuff worth 50'000 gold to merchants for 200 gold and mumble, in front of the computer, ""Keep the change, you filthy animal"".

- I free all the slaves I find, no matter what it takes.

- Every time I visit Maar Gan, the first thing I do is kill Anhaedra no matter what.

- Since I found out how to do it / that it's possible, I always save Tarhiel from dying.

Apologies if this doesn't fit the sub-reddit, I saw the /r/talesfromtamriel link but it felt more based on scripts, rather than play experience. (also, holy shit I wrote a lot more than I wanted to. Heads up!)

I wanted to share with you guys my third night on playing. I've been trying to get into Morrowind for years. I first received a copy of vanilla Morrowind many, many years ago from a friend for a birthday present. I played it a little but it got shelved pretty quick because the combat was excruciatingly painful to play through.

Many years later and I got the sudden urge to install it again. I couldn't find my disc and so I picked up the GOTY edition and put some nice graphical enhancements in an attempt to keep my interest for more than 10 minutes this time.

Over the last few days, I've noticed lots of comments from people saying that I should not go in expecting anything. Just play the game and enjoy it for what it's worth. So I did and I still am.

I've made a conscious effort to read each book I come across, although I do skip a few of em if I feel the text gets a little boring. I've read some amazing tales about an archaeologist finding a lost dwemer vault, a thief stealing back her wedding present, a lot of background history on the house wars and particularly the redoran fights. The stories themselves have for some reason gripped me in a way I never thought they would. I'm not usually one for reading in-game text, nor am I one for killing a whole room of people so I can loot their books, but this time around I've caught myself doing just that a number of times.

--------------------------------------------

I've started playing a mage character, a female altmer wizard. (err, wizardess?) Anyway, tonight I had my first encounter with cliff racers. I've been steadily progressing through the mage's guild questline for the last few days and after lollygagging around a lake collecting flowers for 3 hours (damn you stoneflowers!), I was dispatched to collect some fees from higher ranking members who hadn't paid up.

I headed out of Balmora and headed over the hill, past the dwemer ruins near Fort Moonmoth. I could see these weird little pterodactyl looking guys in the sky and I realized pretty quickly what I was up against.

Of course, this being my first exploration mission (aside from the flowers), the region happens to experience what can only be described as the most horrific weather pattern I've ever come across in a game. I'm talking full on sand storm. I tried to keep to the path but found myself going in circles, pissing off every cliff racer in a 2 mile radius. 

I had barely any magic left and stumbled upon a Dunmer fortress/city. I levitated up to the top floor and tried my luck entering into some random room. I got lucky, there was a bed! I lay down, only 3hp and 15 magicka remaining, completely drained of fatigue. My heart was racing and I quickly cased the barrels/chests before setting out again. (scored an ebony long sword, wuuuut!)

I stumbled upon the cave and unfortunately the quest contact wasn't helpful. She refused to pay, so she died. I somehow survived and explored the cave a little deeper, fireballing my way into a boss room with another bed and some great literature. I read about some mage cults and picked up a few cool scrolls.

I exited the cave and returned to Balmora, only to find I forgot to do the other half of the quest. Doh! So (fast forward a bit), I'm stuck again in a god damn sand storm. You'd think I'd learn the first time but nope. I have 5hp and barely enough magicka. I can't see for shit and I had cliff racers come at me from all angles. I had picked up a scroll from that falling mage dude back in Seyda Neen, and put it to good use. I was lucky enough to have a slow fall ring and with some lucky timing, flung myself over a few hills and slow falled right onto the Dunmer city again. I landed just shy of the roof and didn't have enough mana to levitate. Fuck. I had rats now chasing me and my fatigue was running low.

I made a break for that old cave I visited, the one with the mage guild contact. A cliff racer started attacking me mid-way, and I was forced to use my control creature scroll. Luckily I had that saved for a rainy day and it came in handy. I made it to the cave, rested back up and waited for the storm to pass.

I finally made it to the small bunker like building and completed the other half of the quest. I spent about 40 minutes extra just reading the stories about redoran and telvanni conflicts, dwemer explorers and much more. I finally recalled my wizardess back to the mage's guild and called it a night.

--------------------------------------------

I apologize for the lengthy post but I thought maybe you guys would enjoy seeing how much fun I had, maybe not. :P

Anyone else have some great stories of when they started out? I'd love to hear them.

--------------------------------------------

**tl;dr: cliff racers, sand storm, suicidal spell casting and mini-heart attacks.**

EDIT: I should mention, it took me 2 attempts to land that crazy jump. The first time I jumped and a cliff racer struck me at the same time, it sent me flying backwards towards Balmora. I hit a tree stump and died. :(",,False,,t5_2r9nv,1363761099.0,,Bosmer,True,t3_1anefk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1anefk/finally_gave_morrowind_another_shot_and_i_couldnt/,

Here's some of the stuff I would have loved to see in the game or added as a mod. Tamriel Rebuilt draws a lot upon this stuff, so some of it can be seen implemented there (in current releases and future.)

* [Great House Dres styles. I know the armor right next to where it say's 84 has been made for Tamriel Rebuilt.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/page-27)

* [Honourable Redoran warriors. I know the armors in the top left corner has been made for Tamriel Rebuilt, and are part of the latest release.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/page-28)

So, I decided to play Morrowind during my summer break, never having played it before. My first Elder Scrolls game was in fact Skyrim. And at the age of 23 (24 in October) I've had many years and chances to get into the earlier games. I have several friends that played Oblivion when it was new, but I never had any particular interest in it. I guess my taste in games has changed over the years, now that I'm eager to jump into a large RPG and explore the vastness, while when I was younger I settled for GTA-games and more linear games that guided you along its path (not to say that those games were or are bad, I still play that style of games as well).

After having played Skyrim for probably more than 300 hours, I've become more and more interested in the lore and feel of the earlier games. Having read about the similarites and differences between Skyrim and its predecessors, I came to the conclusion that Morrowind is closest to the things I love about Skyrim. Not having my stationary PC during summer break is a little annoying, but thats what I get for going home during summer and leaving my things back at the apartment. So I'm playing the GOTY version of Morrowind on my Macbook, through a Cider wrap. It runs quite well, even with high resolution textures added. Now, enough intro.


**#1 Where am I, and how does this work?**

I started off, like everyone, in the costal village of Seyda Neen. I love the look and lore of Dunmer, so I made a male with a young appearance.

Having never played any of the earlier Elder Scrolls games I opted for the option to answer questions to determine my class. Ended up a Rogue, which has quite a nice set of major and minor skills. Not knowing what I had in store, I went on with the main-quest until I ended up in Balmora. Encountering and experiencing the pompousness and personal army of the main houses sold me on the game instantly. It's the little things I guess. Though still not having a complete feel for what, where and how, I continued on for some time with small quests and exploring the city, exhausting the dialogue options of several main and minor characters. Lack of proper armor and weapons made me a bit of a thief on my first visit to Balmora. I stole a short silver blade (being proficient in the art), and a set of medium bonemold armor.


Now that I finally felt a bit more secure, I started to venture out in the wilderness, heading north. My first encounter with creatures were small slug like things that paralyzed me with their venom, though they posed no real threat going down quite quickly after a few jabs. Quickly thereafter I met my first cliff racer, the infamous flying lizards. A tough fight for a level one Rogue, but I managed.


Further on I entered a new town, Caldera. Home of the mages guild and close to an ebony mine, I'll likely return to the city once I feel I have something to gain from it beyond selling goods (I won't be dabbling with magic though, it doesn't fit with my character).


Just outside the city, feeling a bit bold and going off track, I encountered two Diseased Kagouti (dinosaur like creatures). Posing a bit of a challenge, they still went down. After the fight I felt like resting until fully healed, but right after a Dark Brotherhood assassin attacked me out of nowhere. I died the first time, but the second time around I won just by a small margin. Having gained a new armor I felt pretty badass, but with my life now almost fully drained, I started to run back to Caldera. Just as I close in on the city a cliff racer descends upon me from above! Luckily a guard came running and took the bastard down while I recuperated at a nearby inn… Needless to say, it was an eventful day.

Introduction,,59,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/153jo0/naked_nerevarine_play_through_introduction/,"In response to a [community poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/146ehg/looking_to_have_a_lot_of_fun_with_morrowind_after/) I made, I will be doing a play through of Morrowind as the naked Nerevarine, as per [errantgamer's winning suggestion] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/146ehg/looking_to_have_a_lot_of_fun_with_morrowind_after/c7abeua) (I am aware there are higher voted suggestions, but his was top when I woke up the next day so he wins)... He and I discussed my character a little and he ok'd some particulars. Anyway, here is my character's back story:

*Volanare is an Altmer who detests the lesser races. He has an affinity for the arcane arts, never understanding why anyone would risk their life in a melee. Unfortunately, his less than subtle racism and penchant for magic got him labeled as dangerous and he was thrown into the Imperial City prison the second he stepped out of line, neither he nor the guards ever received an explanation of what exactly he did. He could not subjugate himself to life under the rule of men and took to any insubordination he could. Unfortunately, practicing magic in a way that would not result in further beatings and scrutiny was difficult, but he was able to stomach the idea of using his skills in alchemy to refine drugs the filthy cat he shared a cell with, who was known to locate certain things from time to time, in exchange for crude alchemy tools and ingredients.*

*Volanare found one way to misbehave which prevented the guards from touching him AND--better yet!--infuriated the prudish ash-skin in the cell across the hall. He slept, lived and dined naked. He took pride in his yellow Altmer tint and the consternation it caused the lesser races around him. His constant harassment of the guards became too much to bear, they hated Volanare in a way which cannot be put into words. They took the only actions they could, they neglected his very existence, and removed the Khajiiti swine he had lived with for months. As he starved for weeks, drinking only whatever dripped down from the ceiling of his cage he grew delusional. He came to realize his race was favored by the gods and that was the only reason he was alive. His starvation and the nonstop mocking from the daedra-worshiping Dreth character across the hall drove him to desperation. One day, nearly too hungry to move, he did the only thing he could think of doing and tried to cast a rudimentary Command spell on a guard to obtain a sweetroll. Unfortunately, in his delirium, he ended up casting a weak Frenzy spell on the entire hallway. The guards went into a sadistic rage and got permission to punish Volanare in the most inhumane (inmerane?) way imaginable, they forced peasant's clothes onto him and sent him to the increasingly diseased island of Vvardenfell. If his schizophrenic ramblings somehow didn't get him killed by the locals, he would no doubt be dead from the blight in a week...

I never ended up owning Morrowind though, and finally bought it and downloaded it a couple weeks ago with the overhaul mods in tow.

My question is pretty simple: as someone who didn't play Morrowind when it first came out - how do I go about enjoying this game? I've put about 3 hours in so far and it's been like trudging through a swamp; absolutely horrible with no end in sight. Even with the graphics updated the game looks bad to the point of being distracting and the gameplay is mindbogglingly clunky and annoying.

I'm of the mind that when you play classic games from years ago that you've already played nostalgia helps smooth them out in your mind and keep them fresh. Given that I didn't come into Morrowind until 2013, that would maybe explain why others enjoy the game while I don't. Is there anyone else here who didn't play Morrowind until recently that could share their experience? Given that people consistently rank Morrowind as the best in the series and it's the most lore filled (which is my favourite part) I really do want to enjoy the game; I just can't do so at the moment no matter how hard I try.

I tried to get one of the Mages Guild quest, some that required to convice somebody in another city or something so I headed out, I thought I was going south but I was going north. That was ok, I reached Fort Moonmoth and continued as the guide said. Somehow I got lost in the mountains, still quicksaving, easy enemies so far, so everything was ok. 

After I fought off two pterodactyles (cliff runners) I entered some dungeon near. It seemed quite and I entered the door to shrine. There was ugliest monster I ever encountered in the game, something like a zombie and it was called Greater Bonewalker.
It kept sending some kind of a spell but it was not attacking. So I killed it, robbed it for some soul gem and tried to continue, but I was over-encumbered. In inventory it said I can carry 0.
After a while I realized my strength is reduced to zero, so that made sense.

I looked up that the monster was sending Drain Atribute spell and it should wear off after a while. So I waited for half a day, nothing. First day, Second Day, still nothing.
After a third day, assasin appeared, even when I could not move and was still on level 1 I fought him off quite easily, gained cool armor, healed and waited for bit more. Another assasin, fought him off just as easily. Level up!
I raised strength by 3 points, but the spell still didnt wear off. So I looked up that I need to go to temple and find shrine there. So I decided to drop my whole inventory and run to Balmora Temple.

I could only wear a dagger and 55 coins, soon I found that it was not smart to run around naked, but I ran fast. Balmora was really close and everybody was offended by dark elfs shorts, but Guard heard my story about assasins. After a while I found the correct shrine in temple (its on top level) and restored my attributes for 35 gold. Yepee! I didnt have to load old save.

Now to get my stuff back. And run from that cursed place.

Since then he has invested probably 100+ hours into the game every year and has yet to finish it. Always a new character, a new play style, a new adventure and a new story. Inspired by him, and by this sub I picked it up in one of Steams massive sales a year or so ago along with Oblivion.


This past weekend, several restarts, and 100+ hours later I fulfilled the  Nerevarine prophecy. I was even on the phone to my brother as I entered that tiny room for the first confrontation with Dagoth Ur.


I just came here to share this, and to thank you for all the advice and tips. Coming here would always inspire me to try something new or different, and never failed to get me itching to fire up Morrowind again.


Morrowind is an amazing game, and this is an amazing Sub, so thank you.

Here's why.",UserNumber42,46,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/12ut2u/suggestion_make_the_challenges_monthly_not_weekly/,"I was thinking about this last night and I really think making the challenges monthly instead of weekly would be a great improvement for a number of reasons.

**Quality**

Think about this, the last week of every month the mod posts the first version of the next months challenge. The community gets to look at it and dissect it. When we have more eyes on it and some time, I think the community will come up with great ideas, either altering the challenge itself, coming up with fun restrictions or removing unnecessary ones, etc... Also, coming up with a new one each week month after month just seems impossible. It's been good so far, but it's new, can we keep it up for the next year? Or if the mods don't want to post one for the next month, the mods can start a suggestion thread and the community can vote on the best one suggested. With the entire community working on it together it seems like this would produce better challenges overall.

**Competition**

This is probably more important in my view. With more time, more people will have more time to complete it. With a good challenge we can start having better competition. Someone could post a run, then someone else could come and post it done in a shorter time, or completed with more gold, or whatever the goal is. Then there could be a back and forth. If more videos are submitted, the execution of the challenge will be refined and there could be some real competition that would be tons of fun. Maybe some prizes and flare of some sort for winners. Maybe we could start a fund for a the last competition of the year and have a big one every year and the winner could get some cash. I'd throw in ten bucks. This could be a great way to make things exciting and grow the community.

1353119726.0,39,self.Morrowind,13c0j0,A frustrating yet rewarding adventure.. [Spoilers],Brashnard,46,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/13c0j0/a_frustrating_yet_rewarding_adventure_spoilers/,"Preface: It occurs to me the area I refer to as the Ashlands probably isn't the ashlands. It's a black and dreary place with dead trees..



Okay.. So I just recently Started up Morrowind (I'm about 20 hours in) after playing Skyrim for 450 hours. I figured it was about time to see what the game was about. I tell you I am not at all displeased. This game feels much deeper than Skyrim in a way I wished they kept around.. But onto the story.

So I've met the Blades guy in Balmora and done a couple things for him.. But what really interests me at this time is the Mage's Guild. I like the people in there and the quests they send me. Especially the Khajiit. (But why does the Dark Elf Steward want to kill everyone? Beats me). So I do a lot of quests for these two people (Without killing anyone if I can help it. I major in Speechcraft) and get to a point where the only quests that are left is from the Khajiit if I get Warlock.

So.. That's what I do. I am now a Warlock of the Mage's Guild. I talk to my Khajiit pal and she tells me that the almighty Staff of Magnus is here. Any Skyrim references are big with me but this one takes the cake.. (Other than Jiub, Saint Jiub is awesome). So I get told it's Northwest from Molag Mal in a cave on the Slopes of Mount Karn. Easy enough I thought.. I'm level 15.

So I go to check the Strider guy and he doesn't have an option to go to Molag Mal.. Fine I know where some road signs are from my quest at Arkngthand. So I go.. And I follow these road signs.. which point northeast from Balmora. Northeast.. from Balmora. So I'm going and fighting because there's a lot of monsters on the roads. The Ashlands kinda creep me out, but it's cool.. I'm going to go get the Staff of Magnus. 

I'm doing everything in my power to make it, I have my +20 jumping spell, some potions, some scrolls, I'm resting everywhere I possibly can.. But I just can't do it. Why? Because CLIFF RACERS do not give one FUCK about how fast I can jump. They follow me until the ends of the earth and destroy me because I can cast about 6 kill spells before I'm out of Magicka. You cannot avoid these creatures. So after several wipes failing to make it I use a Divine Intervention. Okay I'm back at Moonmoth, time to try something different.

Okay so I noticed I was getting pretty close to the east portion of the map, so I thought there must be someway to fast travel closer. I go to my handy dandy Mage's guild teleporter lady, and I get sent to some Island off in the east. (Funny name, can't remember. But I can remember Arkngthand alright.) 

Well Obviously I can't swim back to the shore from there, because Slaughterfish. I just know there's 50 in the water... But I spot a boat. I hadn't seen boats before, but Okay now I know they exist. So I pick a random location because I have no clue where they are.. and It's way further north. Tel Vos I think it is. And I'm still on an island. Slaughterfish. So I talk to the boat commander and he has a 1 gold option to take me to Vos. That ends up being the shore. So I'm way up north.. but I'm on the east side of the map. Mission Accomplished.

So take 2, This time I have more potions, more scrolls.. and I know about where I'm going. Northeast of Balmora... I head out from Vos going southward hardcore, using my jump spell to great glee. I'm not in the Ashlands yet so not as many CLIFF RACERS.. But I do find the odd worm that I kill in one shot from my Fire Hands spell (Custom Crafted). I happen upon some bandits on the side of the road, they are handily dispatched. Then i get to the Ashlands and finally see a road sign that says Molag Mal. 

So I head out now going ever southward towards Molag Mal. As I enter the Ashlands proper, sure enough more CLIFF RACERS and bugs start showing up. I do my best to skip what I can, I die a lot, but I save a lot.. and I have to kill stuff every now and then. Well I get to Northeast of Balmora, and I still have to go south.. Which angers me a little but that's okay, I must be almost there, I've been following signs forever. Nope.

The road to Molag Mal is windy, and curvy, and at some point there's a rope bridge, and I'm running from monsters, and jumping from monsters, and killing CLIFF RACERS because I have no other choice. As I'm running from some biggish thing, I find a temple that I know probably has two funny stones in it. I've been to one of these before, so I go up and into the two stone room to rest from the monster. I come out with full magicka and one shot it. (Most of my problems come from me having not enough Magicka). 

Okay, so I'm at this temple.. I'm running very low on potions and supplies so I'll go inside the lower part and see if they have anything to sell. NOPE. THEY ARE EVIL. I get dealt with.. so I have to reload from inside the other room. So that's a no go. I continue on my journey.

I head straight east from the temple, haven't seen a road sign in a while... so I keep going until I do. I then see one that points me north.. but as it turns out this was the wrong way. I end up making a gigantic circle. A biiiig freaking circle around the gigantic place.. I see the rope bridge twice, I see the scary bridge twice.. and then I finally find where I went wrong.. and Molag Mal is in the southeast corner of everything.

And as soon as I get to Molag Mal.. I see a strider guy.. but I can't be mad.. I don't have time to.. I'm running from a bug thing. I've tried to fight one of these bug things before.. and it kills me in two hits.. and it's just as fast as I am.

I get up to the strider and it says I can go to Vivec. At this point I facepalm.. because I've been to Vivec before.. I just didn't remember that Molag Mal was an option from there.

Anyway, cutting the rest of the story off.. I get my staff of Magnus.. It's worth 240,000 Septims.. wow.. and I get all sorts of scrolls in the cave, one that I think is quest related. But the Staff of Magnus is mine.. and I leveled up 2 times on this adventure.


TLDR: Walked from Vos to Molag Mal because I didn't know I could use a Strider to get there... All for the Staff of Magnus, and I couldn't be happier now that I have it.

The Sun rises in the east at approximately 6 a.m. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#0))

From there it will start gradually moving towards the west where it will set at approximately 7 p.m. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#1))

It will be directly south of your location at exactly 1 p.m., but only for a very short moment. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#2))

**Ash storms**

The ash always blows away from the crater of Red Mountain. For example, if you're standing directly north of the mountain, the ash will blow from the south to the north and so forth.

**The stars**

Navigating by the stars isn't quite as simple as the previous two methods and will obviously work only if the night sky is clear enough. 

The steps:

**1) Look straight up** and you will see something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#3). In the screenshot you'll notice a bright triple star (circled) about halfway between the crosshair and the bottom of the picture.

**2) Move your crosshair directly on top of the triple star**. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#4))

You are now facing either north, east, south or east depending on what day it is. Click the ""wait""-button to find out. On your first night in Morrowind, it will be Day 2 (after midnight) and so forth.

**3) Divide the number of the current day by 4**. The direction you're facing is determined by the remainder:

Remainder 0 (divisible by 4): You're facing west.

Remainder 1: North

Remainder 2 (even but not divisible by 4): East

Remainder 3: South

Remember: The number being divided here is the number of the day *beginning at midnight*. Therefore, should you check your ""clock"" at 11 p.m. and see it's Day 209, you should do your calculations using the number 210 (and since 210 = 52 * 4 + **2**, you'd be facing east using this method).

Another example: It's 1 a.m. on Day 205. Because 205 = 51 * 4 + **1**, the triple star is pointing you to the north. ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/t9BKW#5))

My first character in Morrowind just found himself in Peligrad, at the inn after taking a beating from the ghosts in the ancestral tomb across the road.

I bought a room for the night, and I was able to rest for about an hour, but not completely heal before my sleep was interrupted.  Now, it says I can't rest because enemies are nearby, and the music is planning, but I have scoured every inch of the inn and nothing.  It still won't let me rest.

I do have the DLCs, but I have slept a few times and the DB never woke me up.  Is this a bug?

I will embarrassingly admit that I ran outside to see if the threat would follow, and the by force of habit looked to the sky for dragons....

== Status of the project ==

Our project leader and chief exterior maker Lestat is still working hard on the many hundreds of cells left to complete the Reach exterior. That said, over half of the Reach is now done and there are hundreds of cells in a finished (yet unreleasable) state.

Planning has begun for the city of Dragonstar, infamously split in two after the war of the Bendr' Mahk between Hammerfell and Skyrim thirty years prior to the events of TES:III. The city will be visibly ravaged by the conflict between the two sides and there is a lot of potential for quests in the city, located on the Hammerfell border.

On the interioring front, the efforts on Karthwasten are continuing apace (mostly by me :P) and we are over halfway -- but as ever, more help never hurts (*plug! plug!*)

Modelling wise, our custom assets continue to expand. A few months ago Worsas developed some custom armour [\[1\]](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22362022/pics/reachwoman1.jpg) [\[2\]](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22362022/pics/rmgarment.jpg) and weapons [\[1\]](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22362022/pics/reachwoman2.jpg) [\[2\]](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22362022/pics/reachman-equipt.jpg) for the Reachmen native to this part of Skyrim. The Reachmen houses now have full interior-sets [\[1\]](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22362022/pics/interior-wip.jpg) [\[2\]](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22362022/pics/morestuff.jpg) and interior-clutter and work has commenced on creating an interior-set for the Direnni (Aldmer) ruins. Redguard- and Nord-specific additional weapons for use in Dragonstar are planned in the near future, as well as a vast expansion of Nordic clothing.

Quests and NPCing are currently on hold due to the lack of areas able to be worked on, but we have several ideas for quests in our released- and unreleased-areas. Our NPCer-in-chief is however hard at work at Tamriel Rebuilt, so his prodigious talents are not going to waste!

Hope you enjoyed the screens; if you want to discuss our project, have ideas for it, questions about what [we've already released](http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/42333/#content), or *anything* else, feel free to pop by [our forums](http://shotn.com/forums). We might seem silent most of the time, but I assure you work is going fast -- building a province is a big job!

It took me at least an hour until I knew where to go and where shops, guilds and etc. was. Around this time I also learned that the Mages guild has a house in many (if not all) of the major cities, which made traveling a lot easier. After wandering up and down, around and around and in and out of every building I went on back to Balmora, but by a different route than normal. I went across the water, stumbling into a large plantation with many slaves. I've freed several slaves from bandit caves, and i'm thinking of freeing them from nobles as well. I don't endorse forced labor, but it's allowed by law… lets just say it's a moral dilemma for my character.

On my way to Balmora I met a man who wanted me to find his friend, a researcher or professor. I quickly found him after killings some creatures, and in return I was given a slowfall amulet. That might come in handy later.
Finally arriving in Balmora I finished several small contracts for the Fighters Guild until I got to a mission where I had to get back a book (by any means) from a Thieves Guild member. Having dabbled in speechcraft I though I'd might flatter her until she gave it up. Unfortunately I had joined them earlier, becoming a toad, so she wouldn't hand it over. But knowing how to work taunt in Morrowind helped along, taunting until zero, bribing her up again and then continue to taunt. In the end she snapped and attacked, at which point I could kill her without penalty. I got the book back and avoided killing her in ""cold blood"", thus also avoiding getting tossed out of the Thieves Guild.
After some more affairs in Balmora (among getting a dwemer box for some information, which took forever as the ruin was a goddamn maze), I returned to Caldera. After talking to someone (I can't recall) I had something called a ghostgate marked on the map not far from the city. But even after having it marked it took some time to get to. Traversing mountains with low acrobatics skills takes its time. I arrived at its gate and actually gave out a small gasp in awe. It looked like a huge magical barrier, and I soon learned it's purpose and history from the inhabitants of the two guard towers at the gate.
To my excitement I found a smith and armor salesman in the basement of one of the towers, as I still had several Dark Brotherhood pieces to sell. But buying wasn't all he did, he also sold armor, glass armor. Except for greaves he sold the rest, but it was far to expensive for me. My stealth skills were (and for that matter are) almost as low as possible, so stealing was out of the picture. Then I remembered how I taunted the Thieves Guild member. I tried the same on the smith and lets just say that I now have several glass swords and an almost full set of glass armor. I look quite extravagant.

After this little moral break I started on the return trip to Caldera. I now had a full inventory and went back to sell it all to a small creature with lots of gold that lives in some Orc Manor, and buys items at face value. I spent almost ten days selling and buying items so he could afford my most expensive pieces. In the end I had 75K gold, a ludicrous amount for a low level (now eight) Rouge.
Wanting to join more guilds and experience Morrowind at it's fullest, now feeling that I knew the land more, I traveled to city where the Redoran house is located (I don't remember the name of it), joined with them, and quickly noticed their neighbors, The Morag Tong. I love the role of the assassin, so I wanted to join them as well. But to do so I have to go to Vivec and talk with their leader. I went there but I haven't found him… the search goes on.

It was an experience I will never forget, and I always think back fondly to the time I spent in Vvardenfell.  Naturally, I played Oblivion and Skyrim to death, and loved them both, but I can't help but feel like both of those games are missing something that was in Morrowind.  I can't say I know exactly what it was that makes Morrowind so special to me and countless others, but I'm curious what you fine folks would like Bethesda to bring back in order to recapture that ""special something"".

The obvious thing I would like to see Bethesda change is the way enemies level with you.  I know that Morrowind had opponents here and there that would change depending on your level, but the vast majority were static at their current levels.  I understand many people found it irritating traveling vast distances to a quest, only to be annihilated as soon as they reached their destination, but it added a sense of danger around any corner that I miss in the newer games.

I also miss having to ask around and looking for people and places.  Morrowind forced you to explore each town and city by not having markers to tell you where to go.  Having to actually find Caius Cosades in Balmora was such an amazing experience the first time I played.

While I feel Oblivion was bland (though the expansions compensated for that with the astonishing vistas of the Shivering Isles) and Skyrim lacked the depth of Morrowind, I still feel both titles are extremely good games (Skyrim more-so).

I think Morrowind fans sometimes come off as elitist, looking down on other TES fans for playing cheap, console-fied pablum. In reality I think most of us are fans of the TES games in general, though sometimes we want to see those qualities that made Morrowind so amazing re-introduced into subsequent titles. To see a game that re-captures the bizarre &amp; alien cultures and landscapes of Vvardenfell, peopled with morally ambiguous Gods and demi-gods, where a pitiful welp fresh off the boat can ascend to apotheosis and slay deities if they so wish in the depths of their elaborate temples. 

I guess what I love most about Morrowind is its tone. There is a sacramental quality to every book, quest and snippet of dialogue. The world has a concrete feeling to it, you really believe in Morrowind's most immersive moments that this island is ruled by a God-king named Vivec, and that by his providence the blasphemous hordes of Dagoth-Ur are held at bay.

So many memories brought rushing back into my mind. The words ""The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind"" transition onto the screen, then I'm thrust into a unique universe, a stranger in a strange world, yet so familiar. A long-awaited hero walks among his people, unknown to them. Whether it's the humble abodes in the port town of Seyda Neen, the bridges and balconies of Vivec city, down to the dark caves that mar the land, where every sound is cause for alarm, and a shout can cause a minor heart attack. The Nerevar's presence is felt among the hearts of the Tribunal, and the scars on the world are soon to be healed. 

I am unaware of this, too young to become involved in the amazing story. Simply mesmerised by the beautiful world that I entered on a whim. Amazed by the passing remarks made by the world's inhabitants, paranoid that every sound could mean a certain end. Feeling like I'm walking amongst grown-ups as an equal, an opportunity I will not find for years to come. Pausing to listen as sounds that seem almost perfectly crafted for this moment are played, and I make sure to appreciate every moment. Every character is individual, and simply by reading, I could tell you the personality of everyone in any town.

Morrowind was the first Elder Scrolls game I was introduced to, many years ago, and I still haven't seen half of it. It encouraged me to read more, and to write correctly. I feel that its music may have inspired me to learn music later on, and I know that it - and consequent instalments - inspired me to keep going. It helped with my development as a person, to spend time with lots of different people who look different than me, but are the same inside. Skyrim inspired me to start cooking properly, and I would never have played it if not for Morrowind. No one thing has had more of an impact on my life than this game, subtly influencing my life in minor ways that have changed time like a butterfly's wings. I would never have taken up an interest in gaming, and my interest in computers would have dwindled completely. I would never have known how good orchestral music was if I hadn't spent countless hours listening to one of the greatest scores in history. Friendships have been sparked from those first conversations where we discover that we both like Morrowind. 

There is so much more that I could write, but I fear that if I were to look at all my traits, I would find them rooted in this game - this universe's influence on my life. One of the greatest things my father has ever done for me was to let me run rampant in his games collection, for if he had not, I wouldn't have discovered such an amazing world, that has had an affect on how I live in this one. Thank you Bethesda Softworks, thank you Jeremy Soule, and thank you to anyone whose actions put this game in my hands.

I really don't know why but every time I got to the Nerevarine and Hortator quests I just gave up and started doing all the side quests and all the other random activities you can find yourself doing when playing Morrowind.


I installed it on my PC about 2 years ago and messed around a little bit here and there but never got into it like I did back in the day.  It's basically just been sitting dormant on my hard drive all this time.  For some reason the idea recently popped into my head to start playing again, so I did.  Leveled up a very strong character and when I got to the aforementioned part of the Main Quest I resolved to do it.  

After lots of hoofing around Vvardenfell I finally got to the Final Quest - Assaulting Ghostgate and destroying Dagoth Ur once and for all!

1369153891.0,31,self.Morrowind,1ersnf,Another Morrowind challenge: The Racer Race,Eventt,37,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1ersnf/another_morrowind_challenge_the_racer_race/,"Challenges are fun, so here's another one. In last week's challenge, [the Red Mountain Run](http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1egf2t/the_red_mountain_run/), we competed over who could survive the run with the harshest rules. This time, however, it's all about speed.

The challenge is quite simple. After creating a new character, you're to use the console teleport to the Shrine of Azura and then run all the way to Ghostgate *without dying*. We'll use two simple console commands to determine the in-game time it took you to complete the race.

I have completed the race myself with an Argonian Monk called Morra. I'll be using screenshots taken during his run to help illustrate how exactly this whole thing works.

It's not nearly as complicated as the amount of text below might lead you to believe. I'm just trying to be as specific as possible to avoid any misunderstandings.

**Details and rules:**

1. Begin by creating a new character. Don't take anything from Seyda Neen apart from Fargoth's ring and the stuff Sellus Gravius gives you. Once you're out of the Census and Excise offices, teleport immediately to the Shrine of Azura with the following console command:

        coc ""Shrine of Azura""

 You should now be standing inside the Shrine with your inventory looking something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aAaSZ8d.png).

2. When you're ready, it's time to start the clock. Open the console and enter the following two commands:

        show dayspassed
        show gamehour

 After entering the commands, take a screenshot of the console. It should now display the current date and time. [Here's what it should look like.](http://i.imgur.com/39G9qMi.png) This marks the start of the race for you. The clock only starts ticking when you close the console, so there's no need to rush while typing in the commands and taking the screenshot.

3. Run to Ghostgate. You're *not* allowed to talk to anyone nor to use any equipment, including alchemy apparatus. The only piece of equipment you're allowed to use during the race is Fargoth's little healing ring. However, you can use spells and your fists. Teleportation spells (interventions, Recall) and levitation are not allowed as are other methods of fast travel (silt striders, guild guides etc.).

 If you die during the race, it's game over for you. Start over by reloading a save created before starting the race or by creating a new character altogether.

4. Once you've made it to Ghostgate, run to Ghostgate's Temple, the central building of the fortress. Once you've entered the Temple, the race is over and it's time to stop the clock by opening the console and entering the very same console commands as before:

        show dayspassed
        show gamehour

 Now take a screenshot of the console once again. The result should look [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/qxamkWN.jpg). Congratulations! You've completed the race!

5. Now that the race is over and we have screenshots from both the start and the finish, we can work out how long the race took you. In my case, using the screenshots previously linked, I finished the race at   (day/hour) 2/3.6105, and started at 1/9.8401, making my total time **17.7704 hours**. If you don't want to do the math, leave it to me and/or the rest of us. Linking the screenshots is enough.

**TL;DR:** Run from the Shrine of Azura to Ghostgate without dying. Post screenshots from the start and the finish with the time stamps described above to show how long it took you.

**Notes:**

 * Again, the starting line is the interior of the Shrine of Azura. Take the first time-stamped screenshot there. The finishing line is Ghostgate's Temple. It must be apparent from the screenshots where you've taken them, so don't cover the whole screen with the console. Remember that the console commands we use measure the *in-game* time, so pausing the game won't have any effect on your result.

 * Resting is allowed. However, it will cost you a great deal of time, as it did for me. I personally rested in some random cave for 11 hours to restore my health, so I'll probably come last in this race.

 * Disabling Tribunal [might be a good idea.](http://i.imgur.com/DZPXMzR.jpg)

 * What route you want to use is completely up to you. If you absolutely must go and visit the Urshilaku Ashlanders during the race, you can go right ahead and do that.

 * Again, you're not allowed to reload during the race. If you die, you'll have to start over. Feel free to make a save just before you start so you don't have to sit through the tutorial more than once. As mentioned before, the clock only starts ticking once you take the first screenshot and start running, so there's no need to rush through the tutorial as fast as you can.

 * Given that you can freely choose your route, it'd be awfully nice of you to post a screenshot of your world map after finishing the race. [Here's mine.](http://i.imgur.com/9gwLdXt.png) Those two peaks you see east of Ghostgate were, unsurprisingly, caused by cliff racers.

 * The reason why we're using the console to measure the time instead of the wait/rest window is because the numbers given by the console allow for much more precise measurements. No one likes ties when they're caused by imprecise measurement methods.

 * I originally got the idea for a race from.. [Someone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1egf2t/the_red_mountain_run/ca00ky3) It looks like the account's since been deleted, but I still think it's fair to mention that the original idea wasn't my own. Praise be to our nameless hero!

 * **EDIT:** [Make sure your in-game time is running at the normal speed!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1ersnf/another_morrowind_challenge_the_racer_race/ca33v02) (Thanks, /u/zilchonum!)

There might be a lot of rules and details to this challenge, but the most important thing is to have fun! For me, fleeing from hordes of cliff racers as an unarmed level 1 weakling while trying to make it to Ghostgate as fast as possible without dying is pretty much the ultimate Morrowind experience. Well, not really. But it could be.

If you still haven't figured where the race got its name by now, well.. I'm sure it'll come to you once you start running.

As of tomorrow, all tech help posts will be banned. Instead, a ""Week of 10/20-10/27 Tech Help Thread"" will be posted, and all questions should be posted as replies to this thread. This will keep all help in one place, making it easier to find and free up the front page. HOWEVER, this is dependent upon other readers checking the thread and offering help. Please do your fellow users the service of checking this page regularly.

Weekly Challenges: Every Saturday, at the same time the Tech Help thread is posted, and new weekly challenge and activity activity will be posted. The activity will vary on a bi-weekly basis to avoid putting too much strain on the mods. As soon as flair is implemented (yes, this is planned), custom flair will be awarded for completing challenges. The rules for the challenges are:

* Unless stated otherwise, only content from the base game, two expansions, and official Bethesda mods can be used to complete the challenge. Other plugins may be installed, just not used in the challenge.

* Proof of completion must be submitted as either images or videos. Simply saying ""I did it"" is not enough.

* Anyone who admits to having cheated in a challenge will have ""I &lt;3 Cliff Racers"" or cliff racer flair appended to their name for a period of one week.

Vvardenfell has many places, some obvious and some niche, for locals and outlanders alike to live and to make their way in the world of Morrowind.  As long as you can survive the hostile landscape, and don't muddle too much in the affairs of the Dunmer, you're welcome on the island.  


The dead seem to be lacking in the equal opportunity that the living are afforded.  In my exploration of Vvardenfell, I have come across no open graveyards or public crypts.  Only the Dunmer seem to be interring their dead, in the ancestral tombs that dot the landscape.  Maybe some of the dead are carried off, out of the open, but we don't know where they end up.  For all we know, they're thrown in the bushes somewhere, or off of a cliff.


 I can accept that some may not receive--or deserve-- burial.  Barbarians, scouts, and (unfortunately) lost travelers will likely die in the wilderness, their corpses left to be devoured by some beast or to rot in the dirt.  Bandits and smugglers, whether slain by a do-gooder adventurer or betrayed by their own kind, may end up face-down on the floor of a cave.  Animals, of course, live and die in the wild (even the beloved pack guar).  


But what about the humble townsperson? The intrepid adventurer?  I'm talking about YOU, outlander! And all of the folk of Vvardenfell who aren't afforded the luxury of an ancestral tomb! Native Dunmer may not even be afforded a decent burial if they are too poor.  Does this mean they do not deserve a posthumous dedication? NO!


All men and mer who are respectable in life should have some sort of respect given to them when they die!


*(I recently installed the Fort Firemoth download for Morrowind, and reclaimed the Ward of Akavir for the Legion.  I had a blast! The island and the fort manage to have their own unique style-- I liked the circular layout of the island, and the atmosphere of the fort (just wait until you get to the rats!)  Having companions to fight with-- dear Mara, courageous Aronil, and mighty Hjrondir-- was also great... Until they died.*  


*I am roleplaying a mostly-honorable warrior, and I would like to honor my fallen companions.  I've already taken a few pieces of their equipment and enchanted it with their names (e.g. ""Aronil's Dagger"").  I just can't find a place to put it!  It seems the only places for a corpse (or a memorial) are either in the wild or in a tomb-- but all of the tombs are named and occupied, and the wilderness is undignified.  What should I do?)*

Although it was the third Elder Scrolls game I've played (after starting Skyrim but not finishing because I had to leave the 360 at home, and finishing Oblivion) I was enjoying it much more than Oblivion, and I haven't played enough Skyrim to judge it yet, but I didn't really understand much of the fuss about the game other than it doing atmosphere very well. 

[While doing the main quest, that all changed. I had just started the Third Trial of the Nerevarine, and was on my way to the Eye of the Needle to Speak with Azura. When I got the Moon and Star, and let Azura speak to me, I still wasn't very impressed. After the cutscene, it took me a second to notice that I was surrounded by ghosts. Speaking to them, they each told their story of how they sought the Moon-and-Star, believing they were Nerevar incarnate. Each ended with the sentence ""I was not the one."" Even without voice acting for the characters, I got chills.](/spoiler)

My first impressions were that the combat was a little annoying and the walking speed a little slow. Luckily, the former was fixed by a combination of realising low fatigue affects the chances of your attack hitting and simply levelling up. The latter was easily fixed by exploiting the boots of blinding speed.

I found most NPCs to be bland, what with the copy/paste dialogue and all, but the interesting characters were very interesting. I particularly love Crassius Curio. The other complaint I have is that the NPCs don't really have proper lives which isn't very immersive.  However, the team behind this game obviously didn't have the ability to perform the feats seen in the later games of the series so this is very easily forgiven. Apart from that, I have to agree with the general consensus of the Morrowind fanbase that this is the best Elder Scrolls game.

The story was definitely the best Main Quest story of the three games I've played and the sheer variety of weapons and spells is  phenomenal. I love levitate especially. Also, I must point out that Creeper and I are bros.

 Before playing this game, I didn't understand why there was a general dislike for randomised loot and leveled enemies, but I have been enlightened. It really feels like I'm growing as a character when I level. The loot in this game makes it feel more real. The newer games are like Pokémon in that the enemies grow with you but that kind of takes me out of it. 

I bring up Pokémon to bring up the parallel that when I play the latter parts of the game I cannot help but wonder how helpless someone would be if they started off in one of the towns you go to near the end of the game. Would they have their level five pokémon decimated by level forties? Or would they have a level forty pokémon who would destroy the first gym leader's level tens? In any case, the game world shouldn't change to suit you, you should change to suit the game world.

(super powerful enchanted sword disappeared, map showed points that had nothing there, moving the cursor through the map would bring random city names in random areas of the map) So I'm starting fresh. Making a new character, clean installation, and going to replay a terrific game to the VERY END. But I need some questions answered first:

1. How rewarding is a stealth playthrough? I'm debating whether or not to make a stealthy bosmer archer, but I've heard that the stealth is broken. If I shouldn't go stealth, is a magic archer a possible playthrough? Post some custom class ideas for good builds involving archery.

2. Should I install with tamriel rebuilt? I can't really use MGSO, imo it took away from the morrowind feel and my pc can't quite muster a steady 30 fps in it. 

3. I've never played as a battlemage or anything similar, which race and build are best or good for a battlemage character? Is it a rewarding experience?

4. How liable is an unarmed playthrough? A monk always seemed cool, but I've heard hand to hand combat is nearly impossible without mods.",,False,,t5_2r9nv,False,,,True,t3_1e15nq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/1e15nq/ok_im_finally_gonna_restart_morrowind_and_finish/,

The original post has run out of room, so I am continuing it here. The original post is divided into three sections: graphical, bug fixes/gameplay tweaks, and game additions. 

**I have edited the original post so that these sections are not scattered among different posts. It is recommended that you begin with the first part of the guide before following this part.**

---

###Game Additions

##Bethesda's Official Plugins
The official plugins made by Bethesda are highly recommended for any Morrowind player. The LeFemm and Bitter Coast sounds I do not recommend you use with the overhaul. If you are prompted to replace a mesh or texture when installing these mods do **not** overwrite them. If you do, then you will end up replacing your updated mesh/texture with the vanilla one. Also, if you use the Master Index plugin it is recommended that you use the journal fix. Since the mod was made before Tribunal it does not have any of the added benefit of Tribunal's journal update. The add-on fixes that. Downloads are here: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Plug-ins and here: http://mw.modhistory.com/download--1886.

##Tamriel Rebuilt
Vanilla Morrowind does not include the entirety of the province of Morrowind, and only includes the island of Vvardenfell. This mod attempts to complete Morrowind by adding a very large portion of land to the game. It is completely lore friendly and adds new factions, NPCs, armor, weapons, clothes, regions, and quests to the game. It has been years in development and can be considered a 3rd and 4th expansion to Morrowind. This mod is highly recommended. Download here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/tamriel-rebuilt1.

##Signposts Retextured
The Morrowind Overhaul already covers the upgrading of the games signposts, but the Signy Signposts mod does not have an add-on for Tamriel Rebuilt that is compatible with the latest version. This mod is of high quality and has a compatible add-on for Tamriel Rebuilt. Thus to maintain consistency in game it is recommended that you uncheck the Signy Signposts plugin and install this one. Overwrite files when prompted. Due to the relation between this mod and Tamriel Rebuilt I chose to include it in the Game Additions section of this post. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=587756&amp;id=9445

##Less Generic NPCs
The Less Generic NPC mods add unique dialogue to NPC's and adds numerous new quests. The mod fits into the game perfectly and adds new depth to the game. Download here: http://lgnpc.org/downloads.

##Less Generic Nerevarine, Tribunal, Bloodmoon
These mods make the characters in the main quests of Morrowind and its expansions less generic and makes them much more fun. This mod made by one of the developers of the Less Generic NPCs mod. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=User.EntriesListing&amp;id=37364.

##Antares Big Mod
This mod is hard to explain so I'll give the author's description: ""With this mod you have special privileges with the lower ranking members of your faction. You can:

-promote them,
-teach spells to them and be paid for it,
-teach disciplines to them and be paid for it,
-reward them,
-expel them from the faction.

Moreover, some NPCs and Factions may offer their special services:
-the Guild of Mages and House Telvanni members can be sent on mission to collect ingredients for you;
-the Imperial Cult members may collect alms for you, or some ingredients.
-the Scouts can take you to every place in Vvardenfell;
-the Alchemists and Apothecaries may prepare potions by request;
-the Smiths may forge weapons and armor by request;
-the Agents provide you several services;
-the Assassins and Morag Tong members can be hired to execute a target;
-the Thieves Guild members can be hired to steal items from the NPCs;
-in the Guild of Fighters, and in the Guild of Mages, you may hire mercenaries. You may train them.
-as member of the Imperial Legion, you may arrest NPCs. As Knight Protector, you may demand a guard as companion;
-as Patriarch of the Temple, you may demand an ordinator as companion. While with him, you may accuse people of heresy and they are arrested and may be executed.
-as House Father or Mouth of a House, you may demand a guard as companion. You may train them.

Generally, the highest ranking members of a faction will inform you, when you have access these privileges.""

##Antares Little Mods
These mods are a set of small plugins by Antares (obviously). These include the addition of enchanting scrolls and more restocking soul gems and vendors, gates at towns across Vvardenfell, and even living statues in a certain daedric ruin. Antares also has a set of plugins that add unique creatures to the game. There are many more, and most are worth checking out. Note that they are all individual plugins, so you can pick and choose what you want. I personally use The Doors, Living Statues of Malacath, and Scrolls and Soulgems plugin. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=6175

##Main Quest Enhancers
This mod makes the main quest much more immersive. The effects of Dagoth's increasing power are more visible and the quest is given a sense of urgency. This mod is modular meaning that you can pick and choose what you do and do not want this mod to do. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=9407

##Westly's Master Headpack
This mod vastly increases the number of choices one has for heads and hairs during character creation. This mod is great for getting the ideal look for your character. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=6173###Game Additions (Continued)

##Exquisite Robes
This mod adds re-textures versions of the ugly pink and yellow exquisite robe to different clothiers. The re-texture's are high quality and are highly recommend for anybody playing a mage character. Download here: http://mw.modhistory.com/download--7188

##Portcullises for Imperial Forts
The imperial forts in Morrowind were quite lacking in terms of defenses. These mods add portcullises to the imperial forts. Download here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=User.EntriesListing&amp;id=13738

##TwoThreeZero's Mannaz Manor
This house mod made by TwoThreeZero adds an extensive manor built in the Hlaalu style to the Ascadian Isles Region. The house is well made and contains lots of storage space for all of you hoarders out there. There are some issues with statics form Vurt/Vality's Ascadian Isles mod however, but based on the screenshots it's relatively minor. The author also noted that it conflicts with the Marc Mori's Estate mod (not included in this list) due to some shared scripts that conflict with one another with regards to alchemy and book sorters sorter included in the two mods. Screenshots here: http://imgur.com/a/PQBfS#0. Download here: http://www.mediafire.com/?sby6owjg0kvm67b.

##Uvirith's Legacy/Building Up Uvirith's Legacy
These mods greatly expands the House Telvanni Stronhold of Tel Uvirith. Uvirith's Legacy expands the interior of the stronghold and adds numerous new quests along with some nice new items and a few companions. It also adds teleporters to all of the Telvanni strongholds and the council house. Building Up Uvirith's Legacy is a modified version of Building Up Uvirith's Grave that makes it compatible with Uvirth's Legacy. The mod allows you to expand your stronghold into a town. Both are great mods, but due to their nature may not appeal to Hlaalu or Redoran players. They are however highly recommended for any aspiring Telvanni. Downloads are here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?id=5997&amp;view=Mods.Detail and here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=7736.

---

###Make sure to read all readme's before installing any of the above mods. All are compatible with each other. Be sure to run the Mlox utility included in the Morrowind Overhaul to ensure that the mods are sorted into the proper order. It is recommended that these be used on a new game. Some of them may work on old game, but some will not. If there is anything that needs clarified or that you think I should include please let me know.

Ironically, I've just reached Solstheim in the Dragonborn Skyrim DLC, and I'm torn between the two! Oh well, a good problem to have, right?

So I need some pointers on Morrowind (playing PC w/ the first Graphic Overhaul), playing as a Wood Elf Battlemage with a focus on Long Blades, Medium Armor, Magic, and Archery...I think...

First, why am I walking so damn slow?! When I'm just walking, it feels like it's about the same speed as Skyrim's ""Over Encumbered"" slow trudging. Obviously ""SHIFT"" running feels better, but it's not entirely speedy and burns up all my stamina (fatigue?). Is this like a level thing, and the more I walk around the faster I'll move? Or is it dependent on how much weight I'm carrying? Or is this just how the game works? 

Second...damn it, I had something else, but now I've forgotten. Something about loot in caves maybe? Can I assume there won't always be a chest at the end of the cave with loot, like you almost always find in Skyrim?

Third, is there any special trick to persuasion? Is it just random?

Are there any special tips? Places to look for that someone might miss if they're not able to *really* explore for hours on end, like I used to be able to in video games? Just anything that a Morrowind-noob might miss or not think of? I've put almost 600 hours into Skyrim, and I'm adjusting to the older mechanics, so I just want to make sure that there's not obvious stuff that I should be doing that might enhance my experience...you know, that I might be overlooking.

In my opinion one of the more immersion breaking elements in Morrowind is the in-game map and the minimap, no matter how convenient they might be. They always tell the exact location of the player and which direction the player is looking at and any hidden locations nearby.

What I wanted to see is whether you can find your way the world and its quests without either map, and I must say I was very pleased with the way this affected the gameplay. 

It really makes you feel like you're exploring when you have to check the position of the sun to get your direction while you try to remember where you came from and look for clues to figure out your position. 

Nights actually make a difference as do sandstorms. It increases the immersion by a magnitude when you're lost in the Ashlands and you have to wait for the storm to pass to get any idea as to where you are and which way to go, instead of turning yourself to the right direction with the minimap and walking without fear of getting lost.

Anyone who wants a different experience and isn't afraid to get lost should try it and remember: the sun rises from the east!

(I've included [here](http://users.utu.fi/aovtam/temp/AngsMods.zip) the mods I've made if anyone wants them, one to add a decal on top of the minimap, needs MGE XE, and another that adds a shitty ingame paper map for your inconvenience. You have to manually hide the world map by clicking the minimap while in inventory mode.)

Edit: Just remembered: detection spells become useless because they only show up on the automap. Cities also are hard to navigate when you are looking for a particular NPC or house, because you can't ask the NCPs for directions. It's also a shame that the night sky doesn't seem to be helpful for navigation purposes.",,False,,t5_2r9nv,1356016305.0,,,True,t3_14y7i9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/14y7i9/for_expert_scouts_playing_without_the_automap/,

Tally your responses and check out what class you are here:http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Class_Quiz

* [Question 1]

**Question=On a clear day you chance upon a strange animal, its leg trapped in a hunter's clawsnare. Judging from the bleeding, it will not survive long.**

AnswerOne=Draw your dagger, mercifully ending its life with a single thrust?

AnswerTwo=Use herbs from your pack to put it to sleep?

AnswerThree=Do not interfere in the natural evolution of events, but rather take the opportunity to learn more about a strange animal that you have never seen before?




* [Question 2]

**Question=One summer afternoon your father gives you a choice of chores.**

AnswerOne=Work in the forge with him casting iron for a new plow?

AnswerTwo=Gather herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner?

AnswerThree=Go catch fish at the stream using a net and line?




* [Question 3]

**Question=Your cousin has given you a very embarassing nickname and, even worse, likes to call you it in front of your friends. You have asked him to stop, but he finds it very amusing to watch you blush.**

AnswerOne=Beat up your cousin, then tell him that if he ever calls you that nickname again, you will bloody him worse than this time.

AnswerTwo=Make up a story that makes your nickname a badge of honor instead of something humiliating.

AnswerThree=Make up an even more embarrassing nickname for him and use it constantly until he learns his lesson.




* [Question 4]

**Question=There is a lot of heated discussion at the local tavern over a group of people called 'Telepaths'. They have been hired by certain City-State kings. Rumor has it these Telepaths read a person's mind and tell their lord whether a follower is telling the truth or not.**

AnswerOne=This is a terrible practice. A person's thoughts are his own and no one, not even a king, has the right to make such an invasion into another human's mind.

AnswerTwo=Loyal followers to the King have nothing to fear from a Telepath. It is important to have a method of finding assassins and spies before it is too late.

AnswerThree=In these times, it is a necessary evil. Although you do not necessarily like the idea, a Telepath could have certain advantages during a time of war or in finding someone innocent of a crime.




* [Question 5]

**Question=Your mother sends you to the market with a list of goods to buy. After you finish you find that by mistake a shopkeeper has given you too much money back in exchange for one of the items.**

AnswerOne=Return to the store and give the shopkeeper his hard-earned money, explaining to him the mistake

AnswerTwo=Decide to put the extra money to good use and purchase items that would help your family

AnswerThree=Pocket the extra money, knowing that shopkeepers in general tend to overcharge customers anyway




* [Question 6]

**Question=While in a market place you witness a thief cut a purse from a noble. Even as he does so, the noble notices and calls for the city guards. In his haste to get away, the thief drops the purse near you. Surprisingly, no one seems to notice the bag of coins at your feet.**

AnswerOne=Pick up the bag and signal to the guard, knowing that the only honorable thing to do is return the money to its rightful owner

AnswerTwo=Leave the bag there, knowing that it is better not to get involved

AnswerThree=Pick up the bag and pocket it, knowing that the extra windfall will help your family in times of trouble




* [Question 7]

**Question=Your father sends you on a task which you loathe, cleaning the stables. On the way there, pitchfork in hand, you run into your friend from the homestead near your own. He offers to do it for you, in return for a future favor of his choosing.**

AnswerOne=Decline his offer, knowing that your father expects you to do the work, and it is better not to be in debt?

AnswerTwo=Ask him to help you, knowing that two people can do the job faster than one, and agree to help him with one task of his choosing in the future?

AnswerThree=Accept his offer, reasoning that as long as the stables are cleaned, it matters not who does the cleaning?




* [Question 8]

**Question=Your mother asks you to help fix the stove. While you are working, a very hot pipe slips its moorings and falls towards her.**

AnswerOne=Position yourself between the pipe and your mother

AnswerTwo=Grab the hot pipe and try to push it away

AnswerThree=Push your mother out of the way





* [Question 9]

**Question=While in town the baker gives you a sweetroll. Delighted, you take it into an alley to enjoy, only to be intercepted by a gang of three other kids your age. The leader demands the sweetroll, or else he and his friends will beat you and take it.**

AnswerOne=Drop the sweetroll and step on it, then get ready for the fight

AnswerTwo=Give him the sweetroll now without argument, knowing that later this afternoon you will have all your friends with you and can come and take whatever he owes you

AnswerThree=Act like you're going to give him the sweetroll, but at the last minute throw it in the air, hoping that they'll pay attention to it long enough for you to get a shot in on the leader




* [Question 10]

**Question=Entering town you find that you are witness to a very well-dressed man running from a crowd. He screams to you for help. The crowd behind him seems very angry.**

AnswerOne=Rush to the town's aid immediately, despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances?

AnswerTwo=Stand aside and allow the man and mob to pass, realizing that it is probably best not to get involved?

AnswerThree=Rush to the man's aid immediately, despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances?

From the gang called N’wahs With Attitudes 

When I wanted to kill a Redoran mo’fo, 
Motherfucking Morag Tong beat me to it, fo sho’

Eno Hlaalu, if ya fuck with me 
The Ordinators are gonna hafta come 'n' get me 

Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin to da prisons of Cyrodiil 
For the Redoran councillor that I never killed

Cliff racers start to mumble, they wanna rumble 
Heard about it in Bruma, decided I smoke 'em like skooma 

Goin off on cliff racers like that 
with a long blade that's pointed at their ass

So give it up smooth 
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a s’wit move 
with a crime record like da Dark Brothahood

Slit striders are the motherfucking tool 
Never ridin’ them looking like a fool

I can train you Hand to Hand, no maybe 
I'm knockin racers out tha nest, daily 
yo weekly, monthly and yearly 
until them dumb motherfuckers can see
ain’t no one joking with Ice Jiub or Eazy V.

Cliff racers you can't fuck with me
 So when I'm in your neighborhood, 
you better duck 
Coz Ice Jiub is crazy as fuck 
As I leave, seventy-six cliff racers will be popped 
but when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta ‘Rowwind.

[Eazy V] Yo Fyr 
[MC Fyr] Whassup? 
[Eazy V] Tell em where you from!

Straight outta Tel Fyr, another crazy ass n’wah
More corprus I smoke, yo, my daughters get bigga

I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this 
But the Sixth House don't show this

But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my potions 
If not from the records, from jackin the corprus

Heal a Nerevarine in a minute 
I find a good piece of the divine disease I go up in it
So if you're in the Corprusarium in the front row 
I'm a call Yagruf Bagarn on your ass for sho’.

A crazy muthafucker from da house Telvanni
 4000 years old still fucking with your mommy
Attitude legit cause I’m controlling the Blight 
For any dumb ash zombie that is starting a fight

See, coz I'm the blight-controlling villain 
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a healin’

Ash storms takin place without a clue 
Dr. Dag, you might take it as a tip 
but a n’wah like Fyr is on a healin’ trip 

Straight outta Tel Fyr.

[Tower Of Tel Fyr, Tower Of Tel Fyr]

[Dr. Dag] Vehk is his name and the boy is comin...
...straight outta Vivec is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother with Muatra 
I'ma making Molag Bal think I love her

See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem 
I see a motherfuckin daedric prince I don't dodge him 
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while 
And when I see a Nerevarine, I smile

To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin 
While the Tribunal Temple and da High Fane are just rollin 
lookin for the one they call Eazy V 
But here's a flash, they never seize me!

Ruthless! Never seen like a dunmer woman with a dagga' 
Chilling in my temple to invite anotha N’wah 
except when I unload my Muatra without hesitation 
and hear the scream of the one who got the penetration

So what about Sheogorath throwin Baar Dau? Fuck him! 
You think I give a damn about a moon? 
I’ma throw your own ass in the ministry prison soon! 

This is the autobiography of the V, and if you ever fuck with me 
You'll get taken by a Sotha Sil and be drivin’ to his Clockwork City!

I have seen a few posts on r/Morrowind regarding Morrowind Mods that completely overhaul graphics and bring this classic up to par with newer releases. I've taken some time to install all the major overhauls, [Morrowind GSO](http://morrowindoverhaul.net/blog/), [Morroblivion](http://morroblivion.com/), and [Morrowind 2011](http://morrowind2011.ultimaaiera.com/). 

Morrowind Graphic and Sound Overhaul was the first that I had tried. Be ready for a long install (Over an hour)! I messed up even with the video. I chalk it up to being my first install. I got it going on the third try, but it was extremely unstable on my computer, crashing in less than 5 mins. 

===================================

**MORROBLIVION**

The installation time on Morroblivion was longer because of the need to install Morrowind, all expansions, updates, Oblivion, all expansions, and updates before you can start the Morroblivion install. 

I found the installation of this pack to be the easiest of the three because you don't have to configure statics and land textures, as you have to for the other two. After installing Morrowind and Oblivion it took less then 40 mins to set up Morroblivion and it worked the first time. 

The game is great and they did and awesome job porting everything. You start the game in Cyrodill and once you leave the sewers you see a ""World Transport Guide"" who offers to ship you to Vvardenfell where your adventure begins. These guides are throughout the game so you can go back and forth between continents. Morrowind with the advantage of fast-travel.

==============================

**Morrowind 2011**

Morrowind 2011 was a somewhat advanced install. I highly recommend finding the most up to date installation guide. The one I found in the install pack was older than the one on the website. Also, if you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7, Do **NOT** install Morrowind to the default 'Program Files' directory. Install to any other folder, something about the UAC causes the game to not work correctly.

Following the guide step by step, I was able to get it installed and running after about 1 and 1/2 hours. I decided to install the Better Bodies Mod as well. The animations are very well done in this pack, I'd link but some images from the pack are NSFW, Google finds it easy enough.

What made me decide to continue playing Morrowind 2011 over Morroblivion was the game interface. In Morroblivion, you are playing an interpretation of Morrowind in Oblivions' world. The menus are the same, there is no 'Fog of War' for the map so you immediatly see all areas, and alchemy :(  On the plus side, it's Oblivions' combat engine. It wasn't enough for me to stay though.

Morrowind 2011 was what I was looking for, the classic Morrowind game I remembered with some updated graphics to make it feel like the first time.

TL;DR - I have Morrowind 2011 and Morroblivion installed, AMA

You must cause a problem (steal from a house vault, or kill a council member/grandmaster) and plant an opposing helmet beside the body/in the vault. You will receive points by the following:



•	Steal from a vault: You must steal any amount of items to accumulate 5000+ bounty from a single vault. You MUST plant an opposing helmet to receive any points.

o	10 points for each vault


•	Kill a council member/grand master: You must kill this member using physical weapons. You MUST plant an opposing helmet to receive any points.

o	10 points for each council member

o	30 points for each grandmaster


•	Planting different helmets: You will receive points for each variety of guard helmet you plant on a body/vault. REMEMBER: you must plant a helmet from an opposing house (a Hlaalu guard helmet beside a Telvanni member). You will only receive the following points ONCE (planting multiple Hlalu guard helmets on multiple bodies will only yield 5 points)

o	5 points for a Hlaalu guard helmet

o	10 points for a Redoran guard helmet

o	15 points for a Telvanni guard helmet


So following the above scoring criteria, the maximum amount of points you can earn is 300;

•	30 points for using each type of helmet

•	30 points for stealing from each vault

•	90 points for killing all grandmasters

•	150 points for killing all council members


The following rules must be followed for the challenge.

•	You may not use any kind of magic, scrolls, potions, or magic items. The game must be set to (0) difficulty.

•	The exception is flin. You may drink as much flin as needed 

•	You may not steal any items from anywhere (except from the vault) unless they are house helmets, or flin; you can steal helmets or kill a guard to retrieve the helmet for planting; you can steal as much flin as you can find. 

•	You may not use any weapons or armor you find. The only weapons and armor you can use MUST be bought from Arielle, and the money MUST only come from the gold made selling census office items TO Arielle.

•	You may return Fargoths ring so buying items from Arielle is cheaper.

•	You may not do any quests while you are doing this challenge. 

•	From the stolen items from the Vault, you may not wear any armor or use any weapon. Once you rob and leave the vault, you may drop the items stolen.

•	If you are confronted by a guard, you MUST select “Resist Arrest”. Going to jail or paying the bounty means you lose the challenge

•	All items from the census office (Yes, even the limewire platter) can be used and sold to buy weapons, armor, clothing, arrows, flins, lockpicks, probes, and repair hammers. 

•	You may use the money to rent rooms to heal your health, but you may not heal health in any other way.

•	You may use what money you have left over to use a travel service.



I don't expect anyone to take screen shots of each event, so this challenge was created purposely for fun. Enjoy!

At an intersection I encounter a scantily clad Northman hailing from Whiterun (which I found quite amusing). He had supposedly had all his belongings stolen by a witch, along with it his precious Axe. So we ventured out to find this women, and eventually found her going north-west and then north at another intersection. She though had a different story to tell. The Northman was hired by her, but got a little frisky during a campfire, so she paralyzed him and took his gear as punishment. She sounded more honest, so I killed him instead. She rewarded me with some potions, and said her goodbyes.I felt a bit cheated though… I wanted the axe, being the power hungry player I always am. So, I killed her. And took everything she had. Just a little extra profit for a lonely rogue, wandering the wilds. Soon after I encountered a merchant looking for a guide to some far away place. I first told her no, not knowing that it would be final, and I couldn't take it back. So I killed her. She was carrying some nice boots that made me incredibly fast (but blind, unfortunately). I'll be keeping those.

After this I decided to return to Balmora to continue the main story and join some guilds. They were greatly beneficial in Skyrim, so I figured it be the same for Morrowind. I delivered some papers to an official and was promptly told I was now part of the Blades. I had to have a cover identity though, so joining the Fighters Guild seemed like a good option. And so I did. Afterwards I completed their first quest, killing some rats. Easy stuff, but that was expected from the very first mission.

I suddenly felt like exploring and perhaps finish the Dark Brotherhood quest. My journal told me to speak to a guard, which guided me to a man in Ebonheart, who further guided me to its main hall, then being teleported by some lady to Mournhold. I was a bit bewildered after that ride, treading carefully around in this entirely new place. What monsters would I encounter, who could I trust? I decided to just follow the Journal and be guided, telling myself that if I died I'd just come at a later time.

I was further guided to Mournholds Great Bazaar. There I was told that the Dark Brotherhood was rumored to hold up in the old sewers under the Bazaar. After a little searching I found a trapdoor that led me down. Once there I continued very carefully, not knowing what might jump me around the corner. I was soon attacked by some ghosts and and a skeleton, but having a silver sword helped quite nicely. They weren't much of a fight.
The tunnels of the sewer went several ways, twisting up and down. I said to myself ""just keep right for now"", and suddenly, I was in the Dark Brotherhoods layer. The place was crawling with assassins, and I often had to defend myself against two at a time. If it hadn't been for my shied, I would probably have had a tougher time with them. Now, my mission was to kill their leader, Dandras Vules. I had no idea of where to find him though, and probably went through twelve or more assassins before finally finding him. Before this I had finally gained my first level, and gathered lots or expensive assassin armor. I jumped the bastard, but he was a lot tougher that anything I had expected to encounter. He conjured a bow and quickly dealt with me.
Feeling a bit flustered, I told myself to calm down and think for a second. Earlier on I had found some magic rings that might help me, so I quickly equipped them. I then waited for my endurance to raise completely before attacking again. This time I won the battle, though only after taking a health potion halfway into the fight. More armor and weapons for me. Especially his main blade, a poisonous short blade with high hit points.

Returning to the Bazaar I saw a stage and some audience standing around. A play was supposed to happen soon, so I went on and around the stage and lo and behold, a quest. I was asked to step in for an actor that was sick. It was the main part though, and I was given only two minutes to remember my lines. I skimmed the book, noticing the important facts, and told the quest-giver I was ready. He sent me out on stage (an open stage, entered through a door in the back). There I recited some lines until, to my astonishment, one of the audiences attacked me. I quickly drew my newfound sword, but before I could say anything he beat me to the ground, and was quickly pounded into a dead pile of meat. Bloody assassin got me. The next time around I bought some potions beforehand, and drew my sword before entering the stage. But it wasn't until my third try that I got him, drinking at least three health potions. The play was cancelled, and I was told they knew that an assassin would attack me, a Morag Tong assassin to be exact. He paid me handsomely though, so I didn't complain. And the assassin carried an even better weapon for me… a Daedric Wakizashi. Not bad for a level two Rogue, not bad at all!
Afterwards I started selling off all the Dark Brotherhood armor I had gathered. Having mercantile as a major skills helps greatly when you start charging for several hundred more gold that the buyer initially offers. I sold armor to vendors until I had to return to Ebonheart (after closing the book on the Dark Brotherhood quest) to be able to sell more. And now I have over ten thousand in gold. I do feel a bit lucky.

He's not going to be a trained assassin. He's going to be a schmuck that was maybe framed for something due to this figurehead, and he's hell bent on vengeance.

I haven't played a LOT of Morrowind, and if I knew what NPC I picked, it would be impossible to enjoy this experience, so I need a few recommendations for a powerful NPC that's some kind of figurehead or political figure that *is* in the game (No wild good chases, and please don't reveal anything about them but their name.)

I have a feeling this will be very fun.

**Edit:**
I appreciate the helpful feedback, the names supplied have been as follows:

* Vivec
* Divayth Fyr
* Kaushad *(Had my character unnecessarily imprisoned to boost his reputation)*
* Fargoth *(Not a political figure, I need help figuring out if I can work him into my storyline without giving away who he is or his location)*
* Coventina Celata

I'm currently trying to decide whether I want to have a ""little black book"" and go after each one, or pick one and go with it. Feedback on these characters as choices and/or their roles would be greatly appreciated.

**The rules:**

* No re-loading except game crashes.
* No outside information (walkthroughs, maps, etc. except my one ""quick travel map"" I have printed out by my monitor, because fuck that shit.)
* No game-breaking tricks or abuse.
* If I die, it's over.

**Edit 02:**
I've begun my quest. I chose to name my character Arcesso Equitus, which translates from Latin to ""To summon/bring forth justice/fairness.""

I'll be updating this post with Arcesso's journal entries for any of you that might be interested in following. I'm pretty excited about this.

***
**The Journal of Arcesso Equitus**

**Entry #1**

Today I was given an old and musty journal by one of the guards. I believe the gift was out of 

contempt and sarcasm more than kindness, but I appreciate it all the same. It's been months 

since my cell mate and I were loaded onto this vessel with promises of freedom. The only 

thing helping me maintain sanity is the company of Jiub and the stewing compulsion for revenge 

for my unnecessary imprisonment. I've never met the individuals responsible, but I've had 

years to collect information regarding the scandalous ethical misstep that has stolen my life 

away. I have their accursed names, and I'll not forget them any time soon. They reside on my 

tongue as I lie awake every night. It feels as though a storm is brewing. I'm going to try to 

lie down.

***
**Entry #2**

What fortune! I awoke after a heavy night's sleep to my delight and surprise that I've reached 

my destination. We've harbored at a small island in Morrowind. Vvardenfell is calling my name. 

Certainly it is no coincidence that all of the people of importance to my mission are rumored 

to reside here. Strings are surely being pulled, but by who?

***
**Entry #3**

After leaving the boat I had to go through the tedious task of registering as a citizen. It 

seems my roots have not wholly been pulled, as I swiped a few expensive looking items in the 

census office when eyes were averted. Perhaps years of prison has not rid me of my thieving 

ways.

***
**Entry #4**

There will be no pleasure for me, only consistent headway towards my calling. I wasted no time 

with the citizens of Seyda Neen, the small coastal town that I arrived in. I payed off a 

caravaneer for a ride to Balmora in a Silt Strider. These lanky creatures are commonplace, and 

yet their disturbing existence would still nauseate me were I to dwell on it. I have a feeling 

I'm going to be spending a lot of time inside these wretched beasts. I'm thankful, at least, 

for the opportunity to relish in the pleasure of resting as a free man.

***
**Entry #5**

I woke up as the Silt Strider reached its destination of Balmura this evening. The ride was 

surprisingly short at only a few hours. I didn't know what to do in Balmura, only that it was 

a town I was vaguely familiar with. My father had told me all about it from when he was a 

traveler. I knew mostly of the Guild of Mages. I was fortunate enough to have an acquaintance 

in prison that taught me rudimentary spellcasting. Hopefully a demonstration will be enough to 

convince the guild to allow me entrance.

***
**Entry #6**

The Guild of Mages welcomed me with open arms. I had a few of the members teach me spells I 

might find necessary later in my journey. I have trouble casting them, but I believe in 

practice it will become more consistent. The primary reason I joined the Guild was for the 

convenience of guild-to-guild travel. I had a Guild Member teleport me to a nearby town, 

Caldera. It was comforting to see the architecture and culture of an Imperial city. It 

reminded me of home, a place I hadn't the pleasure of seeing in almost twenty years. My 

homesickness knows no bounds. This town truly is wonderful. I'm going to ask around, find my 

bearings, and get the first good-night's-rest I've had in nearly a decade.

***
**Entry #7**

I spoke to some of the Guild Members here and acquired a few helpful spells. A local trader 

had some items I was eager to purchase. The most noteworthy being an Amulet of Recall. It will 

allow me to be transported to a previously chosen location instantaneously! Now I need to find 

a Mark spell or scroll. I found a manor that housed a troupe of Orcs. Despite their 

friendliness, their appearance and abusive tendencies to the human senses were still 

discomforting. My father told me a lot of stories about what Orcs are capable of, but these 

individuals seem decent enough. They have a friend(?) that is goblinesque in appearance. He 

was stingy with his words, but very straight-forward. The creature was willing to barter with 

me and payed very hefty prices for everything I would present to him! The group of Orcs 

residing here seem to be very accepting of company. I was able to use a bedroll in their 

possession. Tonight I sleep with a full belly and an even fuller purse!

***
**Entry #8**

In the past months I've been in and out of jail several times. Some things don't ever change, 

it seems. I must have offended someone, somewhere, because I've been awoken thrice within 

recent weeks to an amateur assassin failing to perform. I was able to defend myself adequately 

on all attempts. I suspect this might have something to do with my release from prison and the 

reputation of those that put me there in the first place. I've spent many days and nights 

preparing for my goal. I've managed to put food into my mouth and hire personal trainers by 

means of treachery and thievery. I would go so far as to suppose that I am proof of the 

inadequacies of Morrowind's justice system. Prison neither rehabilitated me nor showed me the 

error of my ways. It only allowed my injustices to stew within, refining like wine. Now that 

I've prepared myself physically, I am befriending members of the Guild of Mages and receiving 

their wisdom and teachings. Physical skill alone certainly will not be enough to rectify my 

wrongs. I will find these villains like a hawk stalking its prey from afar. I will approach 

them as a shadow, and I will strike like the fist of God upon the blasphemous dwellings of 

sinners and His opposition. Retribution approaches the guilty and it will soon be realized.

This does not include Divayth Fyr, as he is not a councilor, nor Baladas Demnevanni, as he is not a councilor at the beginning of the game. EDIT: Or Dagoth Ur, because I can't reasonably expect that of most of us. 

Rules:

*No fast travel. This means striders, guild guides, boats, Intervention, and recall.

*You may use the 87 gold you get upon release in whatever way you see fit. Weapons, armor, etc. All other income must come from the sale of the fish scales and racer plumes that you will invariably pick up.

*You may level up during the mission, but you may not engage in any quests until you are done.

*You may not steal anything.

To complete the challenge:

* You must have the hat.
* The gondolier must be alive and peaceful toward you.
* You cannot have a bounty (losing it via the Thieves Guild is acceptable).

**--- Release Info ---**

Spanning the heartland of Markarth County, the Vorndgad Forest is a lush, rugged landscape hiding countless secrets and untold perils beneath its virgin canopy. Fearsome beasts stalk the forest floor and ravines that carve out the famous mesas of the Reach. The settlement of Karthgad is the only bastion of civilization in the midst of this untamed wilderness. Thane Grondyrd holds an uneven sway over his village, his authority constantly checked by the fierce and defiant Bear Clan. Those brave enough to stray off the beaten path might find a warmer welcome at the secluded hunting village in the heart of the forest or at a friendly camp of Orcs pitched atop a soaring mesa.

The Vorndgad Forest is calling for you. Do you have the courage to enter?

The Skyrim: Home of the Nords Team are proud to present the first release in our efforts at bringing the province of Skyrim to the world of TESIII: Morrowind. It represents the work of many talented modders over the past few years and includes the following features:

48 exterior cells of meticulously detailed wilderness

31 interior cells, ranging from spikeworm-infested caves to a Nord-infested mead hall.

52 non-hostile NPCs, each with snippets of unique dialogue that flesh out their personalities.

1 fully-fledged settlement and 2 mini-settlements to visit

3 new creatures introduced to the Vorndgad Forest

4 new sets of armor to collect in-game

7 new books and documents that flesh out the lore of Skyrim.

20 “Skyrim lore” dialogue topics composed by our lore experts.

SHotN is designed to be played by reasonably high-leveled characters. Your character should at least be able to survive enemies on the level of Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Our team also recommends using MGE (Morrowind Graphics Extender) while playing our mod. Our mod is designed with it in mind and it will also aid in navigating our lands, which are located outside the bounds of Morrowind's in-game map. Please also note that currently no quests are included in this release.

Teleportation to the Vorndgad Forest is available from Jurid Fast-Travel in the Skyrim Mission in Ebonheart. Alternately, players may reach the lands by typing: ""CoC Karthgad"" into the Console.

**--- State of the Project ---**

Our team is focusing its efforts on creating Skyrim one Hold at a time, with our current focus being on completing the The Reach, Skyrim’s most culturally diverse Hold. Our talented modelers have crafted a wealth of new models needed for this task, even as progress has been made in other modding departments as well. The Reach exterior is already around 50% finished and steady progress is also being made in interiors as well, with the most work being done on interiorizing the massive city of Karthwasten. Karthwasten is currently planned to be the crowning jewel of our next release, County Karthwasten, the land that runs along Skyrim’s border with Hammerfell. While it isn't slated for release in the near future, SHotN's founder and chief exterior modder Lestat de Lioncourt recently finished work on the vast forest that covers half of Haafinheim, the snowy Hold to the north of the Reach. 

Our project is only made possible by passionate volunteers. If you’re a modder or willing to learn about becoming one, please consider submitting a showcase of your work at our forum. Every little bit of help counts!

In fact I shall share it!

First thing off the boat make enough gold to take the silt strider to Vivec. Then proceed to the top of the Redoran Canton. Once there go inside Dralor Manor and head upstairs. There is only one room up there with a women inside, but inside the dresser is a key to a Redoran Treasury Vault room (presumed to be owned by that family). Keep the door open and jump on the bed and keep the door highlighted. The women will eventually move towards the door, but she will not cleanly walk out. What you need to do is time the closing of the the door to catch here in its path. Once you do this she will walk out of the room most of the time with the door closing behind her. Once she is out, just grab the vault key and head out of the manor and right over to the Redoran Treasury (other the other side of the canton). Once in the Treasury head to the lowest vault and use the key. Now that you are in the vault there will be one Ordinator inside. You need wait them out with the door open and they will eventually all exit the vault. Once they do just shut the door and commence massive loot stealing.

Oh btw, don't forget to snag up some lockpicks to get into the level 50 chests as they contain awesome stuff.

So at level 1 you will have the following items: Ebony: Closed helm,Chest,Greaves,Mace,Shortsword, and Tower shield. Glass: Random assortment of 3 items in one of the crates, dagger, and axe. Also tons of the random loot in the chests!

That leaves trawling through the TR stuff for after. My question is: should I actually do this with a high-level character or will it be boring in terms of challenge and reward by this point?

Y'know, it could almost make me cry when people talk about their favourite race to play as, yet they've only played Oblivion or Skyrim.

I've played different races on each of the games, and people are really missing out. 

Firstly, I'll start out simple; whilst there is limited voice acting in Morrowind, as far as I've witnessed each race has different voice actors and they don't cross over (unless of course Argonians and Khajiit do, because they do sound similar). But you'll never hear a bosmer with the voice of a dunmer, or an argonian with a high elf's voice.

Move to Oblivion, and suddenly dunmer sound the same as the altmer, and some bosmer too. Argonians sound the same as Khajiit, and im sure I've seen Imperials sound like orcs.

Then Skyrim, its the same again. Whilst Khajiit are unique in their voices, Argonians have gotten more human, sounding less 'gruff', and the dunmer have suddenly gotten a strange English dialect. Not to mention once again a few nords/imperials sound like orcs (I'm looking at you, guy selling wardogs outside Markarth). 

- then we move to my favourite thing about Morrowind:

The 'beast' races have a unique posture, the bosmer are rather small, and the altmer tower above everyone else. 
Whilst Skyrim has the differing atlmer height, there isnt much difference between an imperial and bosmer (at least that I can remember). 

The loss of the 'beast' pose was a major hit to me. In Morrowind, most races are easily identifyable via a quick glance. On oblivion, you can't tell them apart if theyre all wearing hoods and facing away from you.

And the massive thing that really hurts; If you play as an argonian in Morrowind - not only do you have a different walk animation, and bare your claws if you use hand-to-hand (so do Khajiit) but you actually swim using your tail and body!

I was so annoyed when I made an Argonian on Skyrim, went to go fishing (it was an RP character) and he swam like a human!

Sure you can put it down to game engine limitations, or even because they wanted the beast races to use shoes and hats, but personally; I put it down to lazyness.

Now please don't send the dark brotherhood after me for this, its not just a rant, its rather... 'A short essay that I wrote on my phone so apologise if there are spelling mistakes and it's not in a very accessible form to read' but I really feel that the racial individuality needs to be brought back into TES, or even expanded upon! Surely Nords would walk about proudly with their head held high, whereas imperials would walk like most common folk. 

But bring back the way Argonians swam in Morrowind bethesda please...",,False,,t5_2r9nv,False,,,True,t3_137lyb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/137lyb/racial_individuality_flawless_design/,

I realize this may be blasphemy to fans of TES series, and I apologize if my request offends.  Is there a mod for a more ""traditional"" levelling system?  One where you gain experience for killing things and completing quests, and level is determined by your experience, not by practicing skills?  A mod where practicing skills does nothing, and skill-points are acquired and allocated through a menu upon levelling up?  

I realize this may break the ""spirit"" of the Elder Scrolls games, and make it too ""gamey"" and less ""immersive.""  I don't care.  I'm level 13-ish in Solstheim and have put the game down out of boredom at fighting draugr that don't do anything but tediously stand between me and the plot-coupon.  I've discovered that I don't like ""real-role playing"" immersion, and greatly prefer navigating menus.  I've discovered that, once I'm good at a skill, I want to keep using that skill- but progress my other skills, too.  

In *Fallout: New Vegas: Lonesome Road,* I spent the vast majority of a combat-intensive campaign killing things with a sledgehammer and using it to improve my Speech.  That was fun.  In *The Elder Scrolls IV: Morrowind,* I made a custom spell for the entire purpose of practicing Destruction, and then cast that repeatedly at nothing next to a bed in the Mage's Guild so I could advance a rank therein.  That... was not.

I've looked on the Nexus, and I've looked in the Steam Community and, while I am admittedly new to these things and may not have looked properly, I couldn't find them.

So, *everything* has a good reason for being where it is, and not somewhere else.

I will go through it one by one because I'm insane/obsessed with character building in video games. :|

**Name: Alemug** because why not? He was raised by Nords or something. I like it leave me alone.

* **Altmer** for incredibly high magicka

* **Atronach** for more incredibly high magicka but especially to counter the Altmer's weakness to spells as well as use summons to restore my magicka via absorption.

* **Class specialization: Magic** since it's +5 to most of my major/minor skills.

* **Favored Attributes** **Endurance** because HP is not retroactive, **and Luck** because it only raises 1pt per level and getting +10 early is nice. And it affects everything I do! And these attributes together say ""I value living"" which is very in the spirit of this exceptionally cowardly character.

* **Major skills**:

**Alchemy** for easy $$$ for training, primarily, and of course potions when I need them in a pinch - another way to restore my magicka too. It's a pain to raise at lower levels without exploits, so as a major skill + altmer bonus I can get it up to a lucrative level shortly as well as see all four effects of ingredients sooner which is convenient.

**Alteration** for levitation to make use of ranged attacks vs. tough enemies and get around some areas, and to use open lock earlier. Starting it at a high level means I can successfully cast an open 100 spell with not too many tries. Also, shield can be used vs. dangerous physical damage enemies while my armor skills are low.

**Conjuration** My absolute favorite. For summons to restore my magicka by having them cast into my 50% absorption from atronach. For bound bow/spear for powerful early weapons that give bonuses to the skills and are weightless. +Bound armor. Also, for distracting enemies with meat shields, soaking spells from enemy casters which are scary for an altmer, that kind of thing.

**Marksman** for ranged damage that can't reflect back on me and will damage the many nigh-magic immune enemies later in the game. At low levels especially, attacking from safe distance is ideal for facing tough enemies. 

**Restoration** for healing/restoring fatigue and attribute buffs primarily. Why bother with speechcraft when you can fortify personality? And of course, it's always great to have extra agility in combat. Just ~15-20 seconds of an agility boost before engagement can decide the outcome of a melee encounter.

* **Minor skills**:

**Illusion** for night eye and eventually perhaps some invisibility. I play only with the graphics overhaul but it makes some places very dark so just being able to cast a low potency night eye helps with exploring tombs especially.

**Enchant** For late game, and a few very basic enchants early on perhaps. Altmer get a significant bonus to it, and it's hard to raise. Not enough to justify it in a precious major skill slot but definitely nice as a minor.

**Mercantile** For extra gold early on and for bribing trainers to get them to 100 disposition as I will be paying a few trainers a lot of gold early on for armor training to raise endurance to 100 ASAP.

**Mysticism** For teleportation spells and soul trap.

**Spear** Was debating over this vs. blunt vs. axe for quite awhile. Blunt is the inbetween, with lower damage but higher reach on warhammers than axes but of course shorter and more damaging than spear. But, there's no bound warhammer sadly. Also, as my melee weapon will generally be used most against less threatening enemies, the extra reach of a spear lets me kill critters with less chance of getting blight from some asshole cliff racer. And spears are a special part of Morrowind that should've obviously not been taken out in Oblivion/Skyrim, as well as being kind of fitting as a backup weapon for an archer I feel. As a minor rather than major skill, I also get more endurance from training it. I considered having it as misc, but then, it doesn't feel as much a part of my character as it should be. +I want it to level at a decent rate later on.
 

**Other notes**: 

All attributes are represented by at least one misc skill so I can easily raise them via training in nice x5s. 

My major/minor skills tend to be matched with my highest attributes well, so I don't have a low attribute that'll take very high skill levels to get up to a decent level.

Ancestral Ghost + Non-magical/enchanted weapon type = free/easy extra weapon training, as I'll be swinging at them 4x almost every time I need some magicka restoration.

I am a towering golden elf wizard and I will look badass in a colovian fur helm and a robe.

I attempt to chalk this up to perhaps mistakes in translation or something within the reality of the gameworld, or how Dunmeri society appears to refer to any separate cultures or people small or large as Houses, such as perhaps House Altmer, House Nord, House Septim, etc.  Yet this one text is harder for me to brush off as it deliberately says House Dwemer was a 'lost' house of Dunmers.

http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_Lost_Prophecy

&gt; [from the Apographa of the Dissident Priests, annotated by Gilvas Barelo, Abbot of Holamayan]

&gt; From seventh sign of eleventh generation,
&gt; Neither Hound nor Guar, nor Seed nor Harrow,
&gt; But Dragon-born and far-star-marked,
&gt; Outlander Incarnate beneath Red Mountain,
&gt; Blessed Guest counters seven curses,
&gt; Star-blessed hand wields thrice-cursed blade,
&gt; To reap the harvest of the unmourned house.

&gt; Notes
&gt; Lines 1-3: 'Of ancient family, but not of the four great Ashlander clans. Born under foreign stars and the sign of the Dragon -- the Imperial sign.'
&gt; Line 4-5: 'Outlander Incarnate' appears as a formal epithet, stressing the linkage between the words. The Outlander Incarnate is a 'blessed guest', one not born of the tribes but accepted as a guest with rights of hearth and hospitality. Under Red Mountain he will confront and balance against seven curses. See the Seven Curses prophecy; also, Dagoth Ur is served by his seven kin, once great wizard-lords, called 'ash vampires' by the Ashlanders.
&gt; Line 6-7: 'Star-blessed' suggests Azura, the Daedra Lord and patron of magic, fate, and prophecy. 'Thrice-cursed blade' may refer to a weapon called Keening, associated in certain legends with the Battle of Red Mountain and Dwemer craftlord Kagrenac. 'Reap the harvest' is a reference to the proverb, ""You harvest from the seeds you plant,"" which means you get what your labors deserve, in both a positive sense of reward and negative sense of punishment. **The 'unmourned house' could be either or both of the lost Great Houses of the Dunmer -- House Dwemer and House Dagoth.**

So what is /r/morrowind 's opinion on this?  Were the Dwemer just a house of Chimer that further rebelled against the ways of the Aldmer AND their Chimer brethren and chose science and further 'profane' magics like Man?  Or is this just an example of a mistake within lore that the devs initially hadn't decided on and ended up changing but not before missing some lore mistakes in their books?

This started as a way to kill time during school, but I plan to work on it for a while yet. Enjoy.

********

I suppose it begins on the ship. It was a prison ship, a native build pressed into Imperial service, which was a practice dating back to Katariah. I wonder what the old Empress would think, seeing the practice applied to her own people.


Political history aside, this bilgewater-laden tub didn't handle storms well and the journey around Black Marsh was as unpleasant as any I've had since. Eventually though, you just leaned to sleep through them. Never soundly, though. Couldn't sleep for an hour with one dream or another. The last day out at sea was stormy, as usual. I dreamed as usual. But by Y'ffre, it was a strange one.


It started with the same nightmare I'd had ever since learning I was being deported to the ashpit the natives call Morrowind. Dusty wastes, red blight, the usual. Then everything got very strange, and a reverberating female voice began to speak.


*""They have taken you from the Imperial City's prisons""*

 Yes, they had. A stocky woman in scaled armor and a curved sword had dragged me out of it, to be precise. 


*""First by carriage, and now by boat""* 

And a damn bumpy ride it was, too. 


*""To the east, to Morrowind.""* 

That's the idea. 


*""Fear not, for I am watching. You have been chosen.""*


Now, the only thing I've ever been chosen for was to hold the getaway horse outside Red Diamond Jewelry, and the only time I've been watched was after I got arrested for it. So you'll understand if this dream, in addition to calling my sanity into question, did not exactly fill me with comfort.


""Wake Up. We're Here. Why are you shaking? Are you ok?"" I suppose being woken up by the Dunmer came as something of a relief. He was grey-skinned and bare chested. If I saw him now, I'd instantly mark him as native. He wore gold ear-rings in a fashionable style, and his voice bore the trace of years of ash and hackle-lo smoke.


""Wake up. Stand up."" he said. ""There you go. You were dreaming. What's your name?"" Was it that obvious? At any rate, the Dark Elf was waiting for his response. ""Exovian"" I replied. The mer nodded. ""Well, not even last night's storm could wake you. I heard them say we've reached Morrowind. I'm sure they'll let us go.""


As he spoke, the sound of bootsteps began echoing through the creaking hull. ""Quiet,"" he hissed. ""Here comes the guard.""


The guard was a short man, well-muscled with brown hair and looking as though he'd handled the night nearly as poorly as I. Nonetheless, a reluctant authority hardened his features, and he said to me in a tone that invited no argument: ""This is where you get off. Come with me.""


As he led me out of the hold, I took a moment to take one last look around the ship. The tables were still out from last night. Breakfast had not been served, but already some sailors were quietly gnawing on their rations. As we climbed the steps to the upper level, the swaying of the ship became more pronounced, and in the dim light of the hold this made moving somewhat difficult. At last, we reached the hatch leading to the deck. The Imperial stood next to the steps and motioned for me to continue.


""Get yourself up on deck, and let's keep this as civil as possible.""


Fine by me, Imperial. There was no hesitation as I reached for that hatch. I had no idea what was on the other side and frankly, I didn't care. It was a new country, a new chance, and hopefully, freedom.",,False,,t5_2r9nv,1354676294.0,,ThievesGuildFlair,True,t3_14amyl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/14amyl/part_1_of_my_wip_morrowind_fanfic/,

Today, I went to the Sandas Ancestral Tomb, and since I like exploring everywhere, I've seen quite a few ancestral tombs before, nothing truly special before, I thought they were all the same before... but this one scared me. When I went in, I forgot I had a Lantern that I picked up at the beginning of the game. I tried using my light spell, but I could only use it once since the chances of casting it were so low and cost a bit high. When I first entered the tomb and descended the stairs into the dark abyss, I stopped dead in my tracks to discover some strangely deformed creature looking at me. It was a Bonewalker. It looked somewhat like a zombie, except bulkier somewhat. In my moment of panic, I blindly chopped at the creature in the dark, finally managing to fell the beast before great harm could come to me. I wasted half of my magicka using my light spell. The illumination from the light was good enough to alert me of the next bonewalker before another panic attack befell me. By this time, after looking around for some loot, my spell ran out. By this time, I've heard some rather strange chanting. I searched my inventory for some light source, looking for additional spells, but finding none, I decided to press on. Through the door was a ghostly creature, the name of it escapes me, but I assure you, it scared me no less, if not more, than the bonewalkers. Moving on to the treasure, blindly feeling my way against the wall, I finally found my way to the treasure, picking the lock, I attempted to pry it open to get the fruit of my labor. Unfortunately, my luck at other plans for me, as I received a message stating ""I suddenly feel cold"" and hearing the approach of potential enemies, I rushed to search through my inventory, in one last futile attempt, but alas... I found my lantern. Using it to replace my shield, the lantern didn't illuminate more than a few feet in front of me. I've never been scared this much (since Amnesia: Dark Descent) in my life, facing down 2 predators in their natural environment. After felling both, I didn't even bother with the treasure inside, but instead bolting out of there.

I'm really enjoying the quests, I'm already use to the battle mechanics, and even the world itself is amazing. I feel there is so much to do and explore. My only gripe is the journal feels so confusing to me. I've been using the UESP quest guide and making my own sort of quest log on paper to keep track of the current quests I'm on or that I've finished. But this game is fantastic and I don't think I'll be quitting it anytime soon!

After a few days of feeling vaguely superior to them, I realized that I myself have never even touched 2 of the 5 games in the series. So, I'm firing up DOSBox and going through Arena and Daggerfall to round out my experience. As most of my experience is with Morrowind, I wondered how these two handled and felt when compared to it.
