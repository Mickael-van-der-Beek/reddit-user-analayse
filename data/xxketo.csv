I was hoping that after my endocrinologist signed off and after I reached my goal weight, the husband and I could maybe spawn, since we had tried like crazy before my thyroid broke, but to no avail.


 After the initial adjustment, I loved keto, and 9 days later, my husband joined me in the magical land of eggs, ranch, giant tasty salads, avocados, ultra-dark chocolate, and bacon, bacon, bacon. 


And we lost weight! And my thyroid finally responded to the medication! But we were not super vigilant about those pesky propolactics, especially on major holidays...like a certain Ireland-centric day.


I started at 208 lbs, my initial goal weight was 150 lbs, and shark week was going to be last week. Right now I'm at 183 lbs. I was planning to take my sort-of monthly progress pictures as soon as shark week ended...but though I sensed fins on the horizon, the shark never appeared.


Then I started feeing weird. Freezing cold, sore yet extra fluffy breasts, tired but waking up before my alarm every day...still no shark week.


On Saturday morning, I took a home test...


PREGNANT!


On Sunday I took 4 different home tests...


Pregnant, pregnant, read-error, maybe pregnant if you squint (but that one was an 88 cent Wal-Mart special...which says all sorts of things about something)


Yesterday I got a blood test....


Totally pregnant.


This is my first kid, first pregnancy, etc. I'm about a month in. Husband and I are crazy excited, celebrated with super delicious keto-chicken Parmesan and green beans in Alfredo sauce.


In between happy dancing and calling our very close inner circle, I secured an initial appointment with an Ob-Gyn, did some research, and got the phone go-ahead from my pending doctor to keep on low carbing.


So there you go! I'm stupidly happy to be joining the ranks of the pregnant-ladies-of-keto.

Update (sad)
I'm sorry to tell you folks, but we lost our baby on Tuesday of this week. I was only about 6 weeks along, but we are still super sad. However, this did help us as a couple really determine some of our life goals and we figured out that we really want to have kids, so as soon as the doctor signs off and we can stop being so super sad, we are going to officially start trying for babies again. So, keto on, ladies, and wish me luck.

1358546133.0,139,self.xxketo,16uamf,Top Five Things the Dudebros Probably Can't (or Won't) Tell Us,ryua,155,16,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/16uamf/top_five_things_the_dudebros_probably_cant_or/,"Note: I originally wrote this piece for the site I blog on, but it's not skeptical/scientific enough, so I figured I might as well post it here, since it's basically the combined wisdom of this sub-Reddit.

After two decades of trying to lose weight, I thought I knew what to expect with low-carbing. What I'd never considered was the fact that while most weight loss plans are dominated by and at least somewhat geared towards women, low-carbing is one of the few where men seem to make up a majority, at least online. Exact numbers vary according to personal experience, and I have no hard data, but in my research on the matter (i.e. hours spent searching and bookmarking specific keto concerns), I've discovered that many of the answers I'd found are only relevant to most men, i.e. simply untrue for most women.

Medical studies often ignore how drugs can affect women differently; similar issues can be found with exercise studies. The phenomena below have yet to be studied, but many ladies on keto report having experienced them. Proper scientific studies on diet and exercise are difficult to conduct and therefore rare, and even rarer are ones that take such differences into account.

Again, to clarify: This list does not represent peer-reviewed scientific studies because such research has yet to be conducted. I do think that any item would make an excellent hypothesis to be tested.

5) Keto seems to trigger early periods.

Not only does the infamous ""Atkins flu"" cause PMS-like symptoms (irritability, incessant hunger, nausea, weakness, fatigue, and so on), but induction into low-carbing seems to cause shorter menstrual cycles in some women. This doubling of symptoms can make starting a low-carb diet very difficult for some women. Furthermore, water retention during menstruation can create the illusion that a woman has gained rather than lost weight by low-carbing, which can be highly disappointing.

4) Any and all bodily fluids can change.

Keto forums are rife with posts about how urine and saliva change in odor, appearance, and so on. While shifts in diet are known to change vaginal secretions, low-carbing can have quite an effect on them.

3) Women's weights can fluctuate far more than many men's.

Period-related water retention aside, many women's bodies are quite sensitive to things like sodium, so a woman's weight can vary throughout the day, leading to great dismay at the scale. This is true regardless of keto, but is especially relevant to keto because so many men post their dramatic results online.

2) Weight loss isn't nearly as rapid for most women as it is for most men.

""I lost a zillion pounds in just 3 days!"" declare all the dudebros on keto forums. Unfortunately, similar results are generally unheard of in women regardless of diet/lifestyle choices. For a variety of reasons, most women lose weight at a slower pace than most men do.

1) Many women can't eat as much as they want and still lose weight by low-carbing.

There is controversy over this in keto-land (no one seems to be able to agree whether or not calories as well as carbs count) but for many women, weight loss seems to be slow or impossible without restricting calories as well as carbs.

Bottom line? Your mileage may vary, and probably will, if you're a woman comparing your weight loss to that of men. Also, we need more studies on this sort of thing.",,False,,t5_2u80h,False,,,True,t3_16uamf,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/16uamf/top_five_things_the_dudebros_probably_cant_or/,

This is my biggest NSV to date and I wanted to share it with you xxketo ladies. I apologize in advance for being loquacious. 

The clothes I've been wearing for the last few years up until now (2009-2013) have gotten extremely baggy, especially my dress clothes for work. I like my clothes to have a looser fit but I have really been looking ridiculous. Things are hanging off of me and I've been feeling like I'm slumming it more than usual. 

However, I am cheap and don't want to buy new clothes until I lose even more weight, so I decided to be brave and just try on some of my old clothes. Clothes that I tried on when I first started keto and literally could not get over my head or that made me look like a stuffed sausage.

I decided to try on a shirt and gym shorts that I haven't been able to fit into since my freshman year of college (not since my 1st semester actually, as I gained quite a bit by my 2nd semester and couldn't wear them comfortably anymore). I actually wore this clothing in high school too. My current wardrobe consists of mainly XXLs with a few XLs, so I wasn't expecting much when I tried on these old clothes. I told myself I wouldn't feel discouraged if they don't fit just yet.

I was amazed when I put on my old clothes. They fit, and they fit well. These clothes are a size LARGE. I haven't worn anything smaller than an XL in years. My jaw actually dropped. 

I thought it was a fluke- maybe it was a bigger shirt to start with, maybe the clothes are just really stretchy, etc. I tried on some more shirts and clothes from the back of my closet to experiment and they all fit. Every single one. Even my old jeans. I went from a size 16/18 to a 12/14.

The last shirt I tried on today was a university t-shirt and it was kind of tight, but I was able to put it on. It didn't really look bad, but I wasn't comfortable. Like I said, I don't care for my clothes to be too tight and I was thinking to myself that I could probably wear it in 10-15 pounds. I vaguely remember never really wearing it at school because it was too small. Then I took it off and looked at the tag-- it was a medium. I was able to squeeze into a medium. 

I cannot deal. Keto is amazing, you all are amazing, and I love this lifestyle. Sorry if this jumps all over the place, I'm too excited to think straight!",,False,,t5_2u80h,False,,,True,t3_1dckyk,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1dckyk/my_biggest_nsv_to_date/,

I'm the one who put the food in my mouth, not caring what it did to my body just so I could get that rush of good feelings I associate with good food. Let's face it, if I had just woman-ed up and admitted what I knew for years I wouldn't be in this mess. But this is how it feels sometimes.  Especially when I get compliments on my figure.  

Let me start this way. I'm a 23 y/o female, and I weigh 230lbs. That's down from 250lbs when I began Keto. Hold your applause, though, because this is not why I'm here. I'm here because of the horrible, terrible, nice people. The people who wouldn't let me admit I was fat. Am fat.

There is a lot of controversy out there about body shaming. The ladies over in /r/twoxchromosomes are one of the first to berate someone for calling another a name that implies that they should be ashamed of their looks (although this has spread to most of Reddit and many other places on the internet). This is wonderful. People should feel free to feel comfortable as who they are. That is, if they like who they are. 

Typical conversation: 

ME: ""Honey, I think I need to lose some weight.""

FIANCE: ""No, babe, you look great the way you are!""

*Sexy times commence*

Awesome, so my sex life is great, but my health is steadily getting worse. I shifted from 140lbs to 160lbs. Onward to 180, 195, 200. Breathing heavily and not being flexible clued me in that there might be a problem. So I start dieting. Counting calories. 1200 cal/day and I'm always hungry. I wake up hungry, I go to sleep hungry. I eat the last bite on every plate and I'm still hungry. I'm so miserable I sink into a depression and start to lose my sense of what I am good at because all I can focus on is what I'm not good at. 

ME: ""Mom, I think I've got a problem. I'm not losing any weight!""

MOM: ""Oh honey, quit worrying you look fine!""

220, 225, 230...

DR: ""You need to lose some weight. Your weight is why you feel terrible all the time and have headaches 4+ times a week and all of your joints hurt.""

ME: ""I know. I've been eating a 1200 cal/day diet for a year and a half, but its not working.""

DR: ""You need to exersice more and eat less. That's the only way to lose weight. Diet and Exercise.""

Wedding Day! WOOT! Pictures! Uhhh... Yay? 

I post to Reddit a comparison picture of my Husband and myself in high school versus now. I'm so happy!

ME: Took this guy out of the friendzone and its the best decision I ever made (insert picture of me &amp; husband in wedding dress). 

REDDIT1: What happened!?! You both got so fat!

REDDIT2: How dare you call her fat! Just because she is bigger than most women doesn't mean that she's fat! As long as she's happy with her body she's beautiful!

But I wasn't.  I was miserable.  But between a full time job, full time engineering classes, new marriage, etc I found myself too exhausted to give a damn anymore.  Besides if people kept insisting I wasn't fat then I wasn't.  

It took me breaking chairs and not being able to reach my feet to tie my own shoelaces for me to admit that I had a problem. I started looking into diets that people had lost massive amounts of weight on and had kept off the weight. I found keto.  I found a supportive group of people here on Reddit who knew how I was feeling and what I was going through.  People who let me say I'm fat, as long as I gave the caveat of ""but I'm doing something about it!""  On keto I feel like I am actually doing something.  I can see weight coming off on the scale and I am visibly losing weight.  Not only that, but I am not starving all the time.  I can eat and I don't have to feel guilty about it.  I can eat and usually find that I'm full with 250 calories left in my day.  I find myself having to force myself to eat more because I am in tune with my body and what it needs to feel good throughout the whole day.  I know what happens to my body when I eat the wrong things and I can feel the difference in energy when I eat right.  I've never had that before.  And I've never, until now, been allowed to look in the mirror and say ""I'm fat"" and still feel good about myself because I can follow that with ""But I'm not as fat as I was yesterday, and I won't be this fat tomorrow. ""  

I'm finally doing something about it because I stopped listening to nice people.  The really nice people who ruined my self image.  I'm not saying that body shaming is good and that the people fighting it are wrong.  Not at all! I feel that there is a perfect size for everyone and its not always the same.  But the thing that's most important is that the person in that body is happy.  I think that the people getting on to people for expressing discomfort and distaste for their bodies is what needs to stop.  I'm allowed to dislike myself just as much as I'm allowed to love myself.  What's important is that I'm happy, right?

I think you guys do a good job of upvoting or downvoting the content depending on how much it interests you as a group, so thanks for that. Also, thanks to my awesome co-mods who help regulate most of what needs to be regulated while I plug away at a job that can sometimes require a 60 hour work week. Sometimes I don't get on reddit for a week at a time and those ladies, especially [u/bakersgonnabake](http://www.reddit.com/users/bakersgonnabake) take care of you guys and remove hostile comments, posts, and spam. 

I noticed a few comments over at r/keto that people wanted to opt out of posting there and only post here. Originally, my goal was to make this subreddit a small group for ladies to get their questions seen and answered. It felt necessary because my questions in r/keto often ended up buried and unanswered while the front page was full of meals that were made up of two days worth of my calorie allowance. Starting xxketo seemed like a no-brainer, despite some grumbles from the boys early on.

I never really wanted to take away content from r/keto. However, if people are unhappy there and want to occasionally post more general content here, I'm cool with it. If you're not OK with it, feel free to decide with your downvote button what you would/wouldn't like to see.

Also, if there's anyone who want to volunteer their time to any kind of maintenance, putting together an FAQ, or designing something special for our little subreddit, that would be fantastic! I feel badly sometimes that I don't give this place the attention it deserves, but you guys are pretty awesome as is and I try to read/comment when I can.

If there's anything I could be doing to make this place run better, please let your mods know! Again, changes are more likely to happen if people volunteer, so please keep that in mind :)

Well, today I stepped on the scale. I'm 167lbs. My husband is 170lb. It's not by much, but for the first time in a decade, I'm technically smaller than he is. It's silly to think that the woman must weigh less than the man in a relationship, but holy cow... it feels great to fit that stereotype. 

I'm now urging him to watch what he eats and become a little more active. Lord knows, since he is a man he will drop weight quicker and easier than I did.

I just posted a question on r/keto asking about the best way to eat around an ""unavoidable"" carb meal. My neighbor is cooking a special rib dinner tonight (read: lots of sugary sauce), so I asked the community about how to eat during the rest of the day so that 1) I don't have to be rude and reject all of his food and 2) minimize the impact of sugary sauce and carby sides as much as possible.

While most of the comments were super helpful (""eat fewer ribs"" ""load up on veggies"" ""don't arrive overly hungry""), there were a number of people who said things like ""be an adult"" and ""don't socialize with people who care what you eat."" Give. Me. A. Break. 

There are a lot of social dynamics tied up in food, and the attitude of ""screw everyone else"" that I sometimes find on r/keto is just incredibly unhelpful. The truth is, that there are many of us who don't WANT to offend our neighbor/mother-in-law/whomever by refusing their food, even if it's not something we want to eat. Now, obviously if someone is trying to sabotage our weight loss or just being generally unsupportive, that's one thing, but telling my neighbor that I'm not eating his special-recipe ribs? I'm just not comfortable doing that. I also worry that this ""take no prisoners"" attitude could prevent some of the more socially sensitive ketoers from sticking to their diet.  

I hate to generalize, but I think for a lot of women the social cost of refusing food is higher than what it is for men. Does this mean that we should always accept the food offered to us for fear of offending someone? Absolutely not. Does it mean that the Reddit keto communities need to recognize that it is not always appropriate to refuse non-keto food? I believe so. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent to the always-awesome r/xxketo community! Interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter.

EDIT: As usual, r/xxketo is the best. Thanks so much for all the support! Also, I think there's a lot to be said for standing up for your nutrition decisions and making them public . . . when the time is right. Not all food forced on us should be accepted for social reasons or otherwise. 

EDIT2: Rib night went fine. Ate some ribs, had to eat some ""secret recipe rolls"" and felt AWFUL afterwards. Felt like I did a good job of honoring my neighbor's kind gesture but also feel like I will do a better job in the future of not bowing to all social pressure.

Just sharing it with you girls (and boy lurkers, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE) because it's my underwear pic. I tried to find the same underwear that I wore in the first pic but they must be in the wash. Thought these were the same cut but I guess not. Anyways...

I've lost 54lbs from March 2012 to today. When I decided to do keto and bought a scale, I was very surprised to discover I weighed 274lbs. Only 26lbs away from 300 blew my mind. The last time I had weighed myself was just about 6 months before, at the doctors, when I weighed 242. It blew my mind that I somehow gained 32lbs over a winter. It still does. Scared me that if I did that again, I could hit 300 without even thinking about it. Immediately I felt very behind. After losing my first 30lbs I felt like that was the weight I *should* have started at, the number I'd been carrying around in my head as the weight I *thought* I was.

I love keto and it's definitely been a journey so far. I was very excited to start, and it just ""clicked"" with me. I loved experimenting with new foods. 

In the beginning I was impatient. I saw good results immediately and would do projection math (so if I lose 15lbs a month I'll be done in 8 months!) but ladies, it doesn't work like that. Your body gets used to keto and slows down. At this point, I'm losing about 5lbs a month (usually around shark week). It has a lot to do with hormones. But I always remind myself, ""*I don't have a deadline.*""

I was also a little taken aback by my results. I've lost 50 lbs, but I've only gone down 1 or 2 sizes. Also my ""problem areas"" have not gone away, because I'm overall the same *shape*, just *smaller*. The progress pics help me to see that I'm losing a little bit from all over. My belly, hips, thighs, arms, you can even see it in my wrists and knees. Sometimes I feel like the difference isn't dramatic enough. But then I remember the paper towel analogy I read on /r/keto. If you have a brand new roll of paper towels, and take off, say, 10 strips, you aren't really going to notice the difference. But if you have a small mostly-used roll of paper towels and take off that same amount, it's much more noticeable. It's the same with weightloss. Whenever I feel as if the changes aren't dramatic enough, I remember this. And I find a couple cinder blocks and try to pick them up, and remember I was carrying those around all the time on my body!! (nearly. Two cinder blocks is 60lbs and I'm not quite there, but honestly it's hard enough to carry 30lbs!)

So I still don't know what sort of shape I will be when I lose 50 more pounds, but I sure hope I even out more. I have a whole list of physical goals that I still need to reach. Being able to see my bellybutton, flat back, dat gap, no more ""baby arm"" (I get a crease in my bicep area when I lift my arm, like a chubby baby), no ""hip-cups"" (You can see how I can cup my hand around the pocket of fat on my hips), and no cankles. I think I might have achieved ankles now, but honestly I'm not even sure what ankles are supposed to look like, I've never studied them... hahah.

I weighed 180 pounds at 12 years old, gained some, lost some, and hovered between 150-175 in high school and college.

Did Keto in March/April.  Lost 25lbs damn quick (keto + running = speed).  Mid-April, I moved back to NYC and back in with my long term boyfriend.  We had taken a small break, and I moved out - during that time, I got my life together.  I lost the weight, ate healthily, and just felt much, much better. 

So when I got back to NYC, I was ""off keto"". My BF and I were in ""celebration"" mode, and eating out alllll the time.  Cupcakes at midnight?  Why not!

Keto taught me moderation, so I was proud of myself for not binge eating the second I was off keto.  Yay! 

Then....complacency. A pint of ice cream a night snuck back up.  Shark week kept me from running one week, then...I just never started back up.  

So I have felt HUGE for the last couple weeks.  Giant.  Monstrous.  I kept telling myself its time for keto again.  I was angry every Monday that came and went without me committing. 

So, yesterday, I'm having a staring contest with a plate of chocolate chip cookies.  I tell myself ""Go get a scale, if you don't like what you see then no excuses for keto"". Went out and bought one...hopped on, and.....

Holy god.  I'm 5lbs lighter than I was when I got off keto.  AND its shark week. 

The funny thing is, in my head it went like ""If you haven't gained any weight since moving back, you can have the cookie"".  When I saw I had actually lost, not gained like I thought, it motivated me to go for a run immediately.  :)

Men treated me with politeness and friendliness. I've always been extremely style-conscious, so I never doubted my attractiveness. 
 
I've lost 15lbs. I have very delicate bones so now I'm a size S. And I take even more care with how I look. I'm pretty sure I'm turning heads, whereas people barely noticed me before. I feel awkward, even embarassed, like I'm just imagining it but if they are, how am I supposed to act?

Last weekend, I was at a bar. I had men tripping over to get my number. Telling me I was gorgeous. I received a text from one of them the other day. I've never really had that happen before. So weird.  

I am flattered but also flabbergasted. Are we in such a ""thin is better"" society that a size M girl is ""whatever"" but a size S girl is hot stuff?

And now I see why I've spent most of my life keeping on extra weight. Besides the common discomfort of having predatory male attention - I feel intense resentment that being treated nicely is so conditional on my weight. I feel like my weight is my way of saying FUCK YOU AND YOUR STUPID STANDARDS to society. 

It's so irrational. Even immature. But I still feel that intense resistance to get ""thin and beautiful"" because then ""they"" won. I don't even know who ""they"" are. 

I feel ashamed that I like being told I'm gorgeous. I hate that I wake up early now to put on make-up, whereas before I just slapped on sunscreen and left the house. I feel paranoid about turning heads on the street, like I must be full of it and imagining it just to make myself feel better. I see myself as weak for being pleased that I'm being acknowledged by others. 

All my life, I was the smart one. I stubbornly refused to listen to authority. All my attempts to fit into the mainstream have always been disasterous. And now, I feel like I'm selling out. I really do. And this is after losing 15lbs! 

Does anyone else feel this way?

Here's my story. My highest was 176 lbs. After working out all summer (*shudder*) with no results, I was discouraged. While browsing Reddit, I noticed all of these people who posted pictures of them selves a lot healthier and better-looking. I looked up the thing that was giving them the results, called ""keto,"" and decided to give it a try. Three months later to the day, I am 30 pounds lighter (146lbs.) and tons more confident. I'm not completely there yet, obviously, but I think that finding keto was one of the best things to happen to me yet. Thanks for all of your support and keeping me encouraged on the way. Keep up the fantastic work fellow keto-ers. :)

I've been a size 18 since I can remember. Seriously. I remember sometime before my parents divorced (I was 11, just for an age range) I got a pair of size 18 pants for my birthday. I have always been a BIG GIRL. Just grew up and filled them out better :P. 

I have had some 16's thrown into my mix of jeans over the years of yoyo-ing In size. I even had a single pair of cotton capris that were a size 14 when I was at my lowest adult weight (179 lbs), but that was very short lived. 

I was out running errands yesterday and feeling VERY FRUMPY. mostly because my clothes have gotten too baggy, and pants were sliding off every few minutes. So I decided to use it for motivation and try on some different sizes at a department store. I was wearing size 18. Some of my 16's that I pulled out of hibernation starting getting baggy and I wanted to see how close I was to a 14. 

I tried on a 12. As a joke. 
A 12. And they (excuse my language) mother fucking fit. And I mean FIT. Not almost fit. They fit!

I decided it had to be a fluke and grabbed two more size 12's in different brands to try on. 

They didn't fit. It WAS a fluke. But both of those other pairs went all the way up and buttoned. Major muffin top, but they went up. 

I am literally inches away from a size 12. A number I honestly never imagined seeing. And even though I'm not a size 12, you'd think it'd be disheartening. The opposite. The complete opposite. I have never been so happy. I am over the moon!

I took way too long to tell the story. But my god, how close I am!

I have suffered from anorexia since I was a teenager. I haven't always been acting on it, but the trouble with ana is that it is always in the back of your mind, nagging away at you. Just before I started keto, I was in this strange binge-starve routine where I wouldn't eat anything all day, but would sort of snap from the restriction at night and binge horribly on horrible food. I was still trying to calorie restrict, but would ultimately end up eating 1800 or so calories just before bedtime, leading to weight gain despite my food avoidant behavior throughout the rest of the day. Needless to say, not a great place to be in. 

I am amazed at what keto has done to help me address this. It was hard eating enough fatty foods in the beginning--in general, just eating ENOUGH foods, because I wasn't used to eating much, and what I did eat was often junk food. But giving it a real try, I did eventually see that I could eat healthy, substantial meals every day and not gain weight from it. I could maintain, or lose weight, but even for all of the eggs, cheese and bacon I was eating, I wasn't gaining like I feared.

Eating disorders often come with at least a small amount of body dysmorphia, and I absolutely had that issue-- I didn't always know it, but when I looked into a mirror I was perceiving a distorted image of myself, something quite a bit more overweight than I actually was. This was difficult for me to accept, but even at my lowest weight (105lbs), I strongly believed that I saw chub and flab in places it definitely didn't exist in. 

Eating regular, healthy meals on keto has slowly been changing my perceptions, however. I was worried for a while that keto would turn into a bizarre eating disorder in and of itself, for me--that I would get close to my goal weight, be dissatisfied with myself as I always am and go for thinner and more waif-y. But this change has been more than losing 15 lbs.

Today I realized that I'm able to look into a mirror and, I think, see more realistically what my body size actually looks like, and what's more, feel content with it. I'm not stick thin, but I don't see a gut that isn't there, or cartoonishly thick thighs. I don't lie awake at night and feel kinesthetically like a beluga whale beached on my sheets. I also don't hear that little nagging, criticizing voice in the back of my head when I look in a mirror (you know, that voice that tells you how horrid you look and how you should crawl back into bed and not come out). It's a strangely quiet, peaceful place. I am very close to my goal, and for the first time in my life, I am thinking about homeostasis, maintenance, balance. I don't feel that driving obsession to lose more, go lower. Honestly, it's almost a bit unnerving, and I've realized that I haven't much considered MAINTAINING a healthy weight will look like before now, because I have been so obsessed with losing weight, whether I'm 105lbs and don't need it or 145 lbs and need to do it in a healthy way.

I know a lot of women cope with eating disorders, and I didn't consider that keto might have some kind of an impact on it. I don't know if it would have the same affect for everybody, but learning that I can eat great foods that make me feel awesome, and maintain a healthy body weight (even lose a few pounds if you get a bit fluffy around the edges) has been a bit of a rescue for me :)

I started the keto diet early December, with a break for the holidays and am now full steam ahead. I'm really enjoying this diet-finding it rewarding and easy to stick to. 

The problem I am having is with the snide remarks from my female co-worker. We are pretty close as far as co-workers go, and I do enjoy her company. The thing is she has begun to offer me lots of fruit and yogurt and when I decline, reminding her I'm trying this diet out, she gets preachy and tells me it is so unhealthy. This morning, I declined her yogurt and ate cheese for breakfast and she was floored, saying, "" I can't believe you put that stuff in your body. No wonder you want to diet."" She of course is tall and lean, and used to be a personal trainer. She feels like she knows what she is talking about and is looking down on me for my food choices.

I know I shouldn't let these things get to me, but as someone struggling with self confidence already, it gutted me. I hate being judged and I hate all the attention around what I am eating.

* Lost 30 pounds.
* Gone from a size 14 pants to a size ~~8~~ 6.
* Gone from a size 8 ring to a 6.5.
* Gone from a size XL t-shirt to a M (I can fit a small but I like my t-shirts loose).
* Gone from a size L/XL blouse to a S/M (depends on the cut).
* Started wearing shorts and tank tops again.
* Stopped having mood swings.
* Gained more energy than I have had in years.
* Changed my relationship with food.

I think the last one is the most important, honestly. The eating habits I've learned on Keto are sustainable. I don't go hungry and I am eating foods that I love. I don't miss the foods that made me feel tired and bloated all the time.

When my husband suggested we start Keto I told him he was crazy. No way can you lose weight by eating all that fat. No way is this good for your heart. I was your typical skeptic.

I’d like to share some of mine, please share yours too.

1)	I would ‘complete’ MFP meals by mid afternoon so I know how far I’ve gone and where it’ll bring me depending on what I’m having for dinner. In fact, I try to do it as early as I can during the day as soon as I know what I’m having for lunch… That way I can see how my macros are doing ie. if I’m short on something (fat) or over on carbs and readjust if I can. I also put in treats like some whipped cream + berries if I know my carb is extra low and good that day so if I feel like having a snack after dinner, I know I can! I can opt in or opt out but I’ll still be good and on target.

2)	I visualize that carb food as a pile of sugar. I learnt this from my bro and it has helped me through morning meetings when there are platters of muffins, croissants, danishes, and bagels. I just picture piles and piles of white sugar on a plate. Suddenly, I forget the sweetness or texture and think ‘Ew, would you really put that into your body?’

3)	I read this earlier this week that another keto-er sneaks oopsie bread into restaurants so they can sub it for bread. Ingenius! I will start doing this. No more longing for bread and butter, spinach dip is now a go, and you can soak up all the yummy sauces

4)	I have a starbucks reusable ice cup at my desk at work and one at home. It’s the venti 24 oz size and I constantly fill it with water. For me, it’s all about the straw. I find myself absentmindedly drinking the water while thinking about a project or creating a document at work. Think of it as fiddling. I have had water bottles before and have never had much success. Am I really that lazy that I’m deterred from drinking water simply because I have to tilt the cup or bottle to get it? YES apparently so. For those with desk jobs: believe in the straw.

I have gained and lost weight many times in my life. It has never, ever been easy, or on some kind of plan that felt manageable in the long-term. It either involved extreme dieting or extreme workouts. 

A few years ago, following a failure of an attempt at a very restrictive diet, combined with stress from a relationship, I gained a lot of weight. I started binge eating - a lot. The relationship ended. I continued binging. 

Finally, I reached a point where I felt hopeless. I was so sick of fixating on food. I started seeing a therapist. It was hard at first, digging through the layers of what even inspired my behavior.

I noticed that I felt less likely to binge if I had some kind of plan or guideline for eating. However, I have to be careful with that because it can kind of encourage food obsession. First, I tried WW. I was discouraged at the sloooow weight loss and how I didn't feel great and how I was always hungry. I was losing weight, but I wasn't really happy and I always felt on the verge of giving up.

I honestly don't remember how I found the keto pages here on Reddit. I'm a pretty new Redditor. Anyway, I started keto on 6-8 and I've lost 17 pounds since then. 

I feel amazing. Doing IF/keto has reawakened genuine hunger cues. I don't remember a time in my life where I could go all day without eating and be able to say, ""No, I'm not hungry."" When I'm hungry, I'm hungry! I love being in tune to that. It sounds so silly, but it's awesome to be able to not even give food a thought and just simply know when I'm ready to eat.

The weight loss is awesome, obviously. I have a ton of energy, I feel very happy, and I actually believe I can get to my goal weight. I've never, ever felt that way. Anyway.... I just wanted to share. I'm so thankful for this forum and for the supportive community and such. :)

I focus on eating 15g carbs and under a day, with 1200 calories originally. I have since bumped up my cals to 1400 since starting a new and very active job. I weight lift, although I suck at it and have only just started about a month ago. My starting weight was a very unhappy 185lbs, and I am now halfway to my goal having lost 30 lbs!

I have certain meals that I make every week that are easy and re-heatable and I was wondering what some you of ladies make for yourselves/your families. I'm looking for some new ideas.
  

I always buy big bags of frozen chicken breasts so most of my meals revolve around chicken. Lots and lots of chicken. (Which is fine, because it's so versatile.) We have steak on occasion. We're not loaded, so anything on the cheaper side is good with me! I'd like to include more red meat just for some variety but honestly, I don't really know how to make anything other than a steak. I have mastered chicken and it's time to move on to beef, I believe. However, my boyfriend keeps kosher so I have to be creative when it comes to meat and cheese (beef and cheese is a no-no, but chicken or turkey and cheese is fine), and bacon is out for him but I do still make it for myself - just not IN things.
  

Here's what I make a lot:
  

Dinner:  
• Parmesan chicken (mayo, parm cheese, garlic)  
• Pesto chicken (cream cheese, sour cream, pesto)  
• ""Breaded"" chicken (almond flour mixed with parm cheese)  
• Green beans  
• Broccoli  
• Asparagus (with olive oil and freshly chopped garlic, oh my)  
  

Breakfast (6 at a time, reheat all week):  
• Bacon &amp; egg cups  
• Scotch eggs

My boyfriend remarks that I'm a complete bitch when I count calories the whole time I do it. I'm fat, miserable, hungry, and mean.

What's made keto so successful for me is that I can't have bread because of a yeast allergy, and I am allergic to oregano and basil so generally pasta was already off of my menu.

-I cook them rice with our chicken and don't eat a bite. 

-They get to eat noodles with their spaghetti meat sauce, and garlic bread and I don't.

-They get warm tortilla shells with their tacos and I don't.

-They get ice cream for eating all their dinner...I get coffee for dessert.

-My slow-cooked pot roast with potatoes and carrots?  I get the roast, but none of the veggies (substitute broccoli).

-When I make steak, they get cheesy potatoes and green beans...I just get a small portion of green beans.

-They shared a large chocolate muffin for breakfast today, and while I'm cleaning up (I'm the mom, after all...) I put the rest of it IN A ZIPLOC BAGGIE WITHOUT TAKING A BITE (this was a huge victory for me).

-I'm going through nursing school finals right now and haven't caved.

-I haven't had a delicious craft beer in over a month.

I'm so fucking proud of myself.  I have never in my life been this in control over what I eat.

All of these small victories, to me, add up to a huge accomplishment.  When I've gone over a month of control, I can't believe how much I've changed!

Now, if only these pounds would budge I'd be even happier than I am right now.  But I'm doing what I do best: Keeping calm and keto'ing on.

The first night, I walked about 400m (about a quarter of a mile) in 20 mins and was TOTALLY FUCKED. Think wheezing, huffing, cramping, coughing fucked. I'm currently up to 4.5kms (just under 2.8 miles) in about 40 mins, and that includes two short jogs. 

But that's not the good bit. Tonight, while jogging, my pants fell down. My week-old el-cheapo black leggings (and my knickers) fell down from my backside and started their own little run down the back of my legs. It was so bad that I had to stop jogging and go back to just walking. So happy was I when I got home that I thought I best jump on the scales for a little looky-loo. Blow me down, 10kg gone. 22lb!

I've been on keto for about three weeks now, and I feel great!  I researched a bunch before starting and knew a lot of what to expect thanks to your stories.  The increased energy, mental clarity, and shiny, shiny hair have all been wonderful side effects.  

I have noticed one side effect that I was not prepared for - my sex drive has shot through. the. roof. 

Honestly, I haven't felt this way since I was a teenager! Before keto my sex drive was definitely on the low end of the scale.  I was just not that interested, and it definitely caused problems in my past relationships.  I'm not sure if my increased sex drive a direct result of the diet (hormones?) or if its because of the mental shift I've been making in finally taking control of my body, but I'll take it!

My fiance and I have been together for 13 years and everyone we have made plans to get married something has happened to prevent it. 

Last Thursday night the stars aligned and we are getting married next Friday night, yay! Still no idea what we are doing for a honeymoon due to barely being able to afford what we're doing now. At leasti don't have to buy a bathing suit. I'm losing track of the point here, sorry!

Anyways, tonight we went out bargain shopping for a dress. Thrift store was a bust so we decided to try Marshalls. I have never been able to fit into anything there but I figured I'd check out the ""Womens sizes.""

I was browsing and decided to venture into the size 16 section just to look. That's when my eyes fell on THE dress. TARDIS blue, knee length, and lots of texture. The problem? Size 16 and it is a form fitting dress so it's bound to be too small. 

My fiance encouraged me try it anyways since he saw my face when I found it. Along with that, he encouraged me to try on some XL Juniors dresses. 

Low and behold, the Juniors dresses fit just fine but they weren't the real item I was interested in. I picked up the dress, held it up to myself in the mirror and told myself to prepare to cry because this dress wasn't going to fit. 

I bet you all know where this is going: it fit!! It fit amazing well and shows off the hourglass figure my fiance and my mom both insist I have. 

It's perfect, I can't see myself in anything else for my wedding day. 

Keto works ladies. I have been doing keto since January 1st, started at a size 22, and now I'm in a 16. I haven't cheated once, I feel fantastic, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. This is the easiest diet I've ever did, and I recommend it to anyone who asks. It's hard at times but it's so worth it. 

Edit: Here's an image of the dress, it's coming up a bit purple but it's a true TARDIS blue. I'll have more photos after next Friday and I'll be sure to post them here. ;)

It would save us a lot of trouble.

**Background Story to the Question:** The dreaded high school reunion.   I was a cheerleader and a figure skater in high school and I was accepted into an ivy league university.  According to a friend who was on the gossip committee (the reunion committee) this made me a target; I was one of those girls who everyone hoped would ""fail"" at something for a change. And yes  I did fail, I finished my education and now have a great career but I also got really chubby. Lucky for me about 8 months before the reunion I found keto so I was able to walk into the room, successful AND a size 6.  Everyone was like ""omg I hate you, you are sooo thin and you eat so much!"" Usually when people say that I launch into my keto shpeel but this time I kept piling on the ""bad"" food like cheese and shrimp wrapped in bacon, shrugged and said ""I guess I just have a good metabolism. I eat everything I want and never gain a pound!"" I don't know how I feel about my fib now; on the one hand it felt great seeing everyone looking green around the gills thinking my life is ""perfect"" (hahahaha what a laugh!) on the other hand I felt sort of bad, some of them needed to lose weight so badly. I do feel that if I told them about keto they'd think I was (a) insane or (b) going to drop dead of a heart attack at any moment so I stand by my decision to stay silent.

**TLDR:** Lied about how I ""stayed"" thin at a high school reunion, made it seem I was one of the lucky ones with a great metabolism. Lead me to a philosophical quandry: *why don't we just lie about why we look great to people we aren't close to?*

I've been doing keto for about two weeks, my starting weight being 174, I'm 5'4. I've always struggled with weight, hovering around the 140-150 mark. In November of 2011 my heart stopped at a Denny's at 1:41 am. I had always had a fainting issue, but it finally escalated to something really scary. 

Thankfully they were able to bring me back, and after months of testing, they diagnosed me with Neural Cardiac Vasa Vagel Syncope (where my brain misfires signals down my vagel nerve, causing fainting spells) and a naturally occurring potassium deficiency (which helps triggers my fainting). They implanted a heart device on February 10th, and prescribed me a salt like tablet to help retain water. I gained a few pounds, as expected. Nothing I couldn't deal with. A few months later I was in a car accident, had knee surgery, and a tonsillectomy. These were within 2 weeks of each other, and kept me bedridden for awhile. I gained more weight, but I shrugged it off, no big deal. I got on the Depo shot, gained even more weight. 

It wasn't until this December that I realized that I had gained 25 pounds this past year. Yes, a lot of it had to do with some events I had no control over (I was prescribed a low impact, low intensity life style for 8-12 months post heart surgery, a few more months of rehab from my knee pushed back the original date by a bit), but my eating habits to deal with the stresses in my life, being the only real thing I had control over, is largely to blame to.

I saw pictures of myself from Christmas dinner and I was floored. I couldn't believe how bad I looked. I vowed to find a healthier life style, not just for vanity reasons but because extra weight meant more stress on my heart. I was lazily looking around the front page of reddit, I saw a progress picture from a group called keto. Oh my god, her progress was amazing! 

I had to learn more about this diet, and the more I learned, the more I knew I could do it. I lurk constantly across the different subreddits. 

And today at my weigh in, I realized I had lost 9 pounds since I had started. But I've gained a lot more. I finally have some control on my health; it no longer controls me! (: my boyfriend and some friends have joined the keto train and my Bf has lost 12(!!) pounds in a week and a half. He's doing it to support me, and I feel closer than ever knowing we're going on this journey together.

I just wanted to share my story, maybe to inspire, to confirm, to even possibly make you feel good. I want you guys to know you've inspired me and helped me make strides to achieve my goal. Thank you so much! (: 

9 pounds down, 25 to go!!

The easiest part is actually making the right choices...",sniffit_,46,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/17foej/the_hardest_part_of_keto_for_me_is_not_being_able/,"...and not beating myself to the ground when I let myself be ""bad"". 

When I cheat, who am I cheating? Myself. I used to be a secret eater. ""Oh, this candy bar while I'm shopping for food doesn't count because no one saw it..."" Ugh, girl, please. Nice try. I did it with soda, pasta, candy, anything really... It took me a couple weeks into this to really actually hold myself accountable. Every shit thing I ate I put on MFP and I wrote a diary entry reminding myself how NOT worth it that stuff is. It's not worth it in terms of my wanting to lose weight and look better, and it's especially not worth it knowing that processed sugary foods really mess your body up in the long run. Plus, it doesn't TASTE good. I am going to be 24 and I want to be a healthy active 50 year old if I can be. My mother is 55 and looks 70 because of the sugar-crap-fuel she puts into her body. It's spooky because I look just like her, so it's like I have an image of my future self if I continue treating my body poorly. 

That said, it is still hard as hell to not participate in the snacking &amp; beer drinking when hanging out with my friends. 

I know it's generally pretty easy to order Keto when out, but when my friend comes over and wants to pick up a pizza on the way, I have to say ""Oh, I ate!"" and make sure I'm not hungry while that pizza is around.

 I could say ""Oh, I'm on such and such diet and can't eat that"" but I don't like to declare I'm on a diet. I don't like to declare much of anything, really. I just can't deal with the influx of ""Ohh youu don't need to diet!"" (I love this bullshit. My ""normal"" weight is 110, at 5'1"". I am 150lbs. It is not muscle. Get real guys) or the armchair nutritionists telling me what is best for me. I avoid it by just not even bringing it up ever. 

I totally caved last night and got a delicious dark beer. Mmm. It knocked me out of ketosis, but I never treat myself with a tasty beer. Then, I realized that beer is my junk food. Cutting out gross processed sugar crap was easy because I realized it didn't taste good anyway, but beer is my kryptonite. It DOES taste good! It makes me feel good! Now when I go out and want a drink, I have to make sure I go somewhere with a full bar so I can order up a scotch instead of a beer. 

It's really hard not to eat fried and carb heavy food because that is my comfort food. Fortunately for my Italian-raised, Asian BFF, she can eat ALL OF THE BREAD and stay slim. I can't wait to get to the point where I can eat a bowl of pasta and give no fucks, but I had a really unhealthy relationship with comfort foods and I need to become in control of my emotions when it comes to food. I don't earn a fried platter of deliciousness by just ""having a bad day"". No ma'am. What I earn from a bad day is a trip to the gym, or a long soak in the bath, or to fuck off playing Sims3 for an hour instead of doing laundry. I will eat Dat Pasta when my body is healthier and having a carb heavy meal doesn't trigger addictive eating habits. 

So, I had some wine last night. I had some beer. I still stayed ~200 Calories under my limit (which is a 300 deficit anyway) without being hungry. I even took a bite of my boyfriends pita bread because it was fresh off the press and smelled so good I had to try it. Guess what? I lost 5 lbs this week. Even with a cheat here and there. I think the key is to keep the cheats at ONE beer randomly, or ONE bite of delicious cake or bread. Not an entire freakin loaf! I don't designate cheat days. If I really want something, I will have a little of it, but not before weighing it against my goals and telling myself I can't be upset if I eat a one bite brownie and I don't see a loss in the next week. 

I had a beer and a bite of bread and I still had a loss.. does this mean beer and bread is on the table again? Hell to the no. My next weigh in is a week from right now and I am challenging myself to reach ketosis and stay there until at least then. 

/rant

I hope some of y'all can relate. I feel like changing my habits and comforts is something I have in common with most people trying to lose weight and actually keep it off. I'm really trying to not hate food, just understand it better. I want to love food and I want it to love me back.

I'm sure many of you know this already, but for those that don't - your international market can be a gold mine for low cost, low carb ingredients. 

Those kelp noodles that are all the rage on the paleo blogs right now? $6.49 at Whole Foods. They are $2.49-2.99 (different brands) at my international market. They also carry several kinds of shirataki yam noodles, some without tofu. 

Coconut milk and cream. Canned or dried. Or whole young coconuts. I even found coconut ""powder"" the other day which appears to be what we would call coconut flour. Lots of other non-wheat alternative flours like yam, rice and cassava if you are into such things. Not all are 'low carb' so do your research. Although unfortunately I haven't found almond flour yet. 

Those Eden organic black soy beans that are $22 for a dozen cans on Amazon? I got a pound and a half of dried beans for $2.49, also organic. 

The produce...every kind you can imagine and often cheaper. Also, spices. 

A couple caveats. I have more luck in the Asian and Indian aisles. No luck in the Hispanic aisles yet - they're pretty carbacious. Asian aisle has more organic items available. Indian aisle is sometimes cheaper than a similar product in the Asian aisles. Nutritional info is sometimes iffy, maybe due to language translations and different countries' reporting guidelines? So if you are very strict with a carb limit you may want to double check with a comparable product. The meat- There's lots but I haven't tried it. We try to get ours mostly from local, pasture-raised sources but we may try some goat next time we go. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting some fabulous find but I hope this helps someone. Obviously YMMV with your local market.

So I was having a hard time with portion control and tracking accurately, especially when making larger recipes divided up into different meals. I ordered [one of these pans with dividers](http://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Metallic-Solutions-Brownie-2-75-Inch/dp/B00285VRVQ/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361352399&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=brownie+pan) from amazon, and I have found it really helps me stay consistent with my portions and makes it easy to enter into MFP.
  
Another thing I was having trouble with was portioning out my coconut oil. I was always using heaping spoonfuls when I was hungry, and it was also kind of a pain in the ass to always have to wash measuring spoons because I use it constantly. I ended up buying [a silicone candy mold from amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Freshware-30-Cavity-Silicone-Chocolate-Jelly/dp/B003VPW0V8/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361352676&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=candy+mold), melted down some coconut oil, measured and poured 1/2 tsp into each, and put it in the freezer for a few minutes. Most of them popped out pretty easily, a few broke but that's not a big deal because I will just melt them down again. [Here is the finished product](http://i.imgur.com/yiYDZSr.jpg). I keep them in a glass jar in the fridge. It saves a lot of time, it's so easy to grab one and throw it in my coffee in the morning.

After a couple weeks without soda, I felt no more pain! I spoke with my urologist and he explained that it was because my bladder is so sensitive to the caffeine that it was causing my bladder muscles to over contract when I pee and that's why I was in so much pain.  I guess he never considered it could be so simple of a fix!

No graph yet: will post on /keto when it's ready, but am letting you lovelies know early. I had *very* slow weight loss (1 pound a month, HUGE regains and slow losses again, etc) despite my high starting weight and keeping carbs 20-40 and calories at or under MFP's recommended 1600. This went on for a few months until I had enough evidence via MFP that yes, I should be about *10 pounds* lighter and something was clearly indeed wrong. I also felt much colder than those around me, run a low body temp, and had foggy-brain.

I'd previously been checked for low thyroid but declared normal. Since I just came back from 10 years in SE Asia and much of the salt there is uniodized, on Oct 29 I decided to religiously add seaweed (nori sheets at first, then kelp tabs) to my diet, along with raw coconut meat. (I hoped the coconut would help my clearly-crap metabolism, and it was also just looking really good.)

I immediately started dropping significant fractions of pounds after this: had bloated up to 221 from a low of 215. Within 6 days I was back down to 215. I had shark week; the 215 held, and now 1 day post-shark week I'm down to 213. So in just over 2 weeks, 8 pounds. (Much of which *must* have been bloat.) That has *never* happened since my first week of keto in July. And I even had some Halloween candy and bread at my parents' place and didn't bloat up. Pre-seaweed/coconut I ate 1.5 slices of thin-crust pizza once and went up 4 pounds, taking a week to get it off again. I also stopped feeling colder than everyone else.

My calories are still about the same: my only big difference is near-daily seaweed via 1 kelp tab, and raw coconut nearly daily (about 2 inches by 3 inches). For the first time, my daily wii weighing looks like a real keto graph: itty-bitty saw blades heading clearly down. Before it was all kinds of crazy jumps and nowhere near as decidedly downward.

DH and I have had no luck getting pregnant in the 5 years we have been married - the last year has involved my obgyn, Chlomid, basal temps, charts, calendars, etc. Finally when she referred me to a fertility specialist we decided if it wasn't meant to be, it just wasn't meant to be (i couldnt wrap my head around the cost) and I started on keto in October last year. Fast forward a few months, lately my breasts have been sore, I've woken up with awful nausea the past week or so and have absolutely no appetite - the very THOUGHT of food is turning my stomach. 

Picked up an early pregnancy test today (I was skeptical since my period is usually incredibly irregular so I wasn't even sure if this is a good time to be testing) and .... it was positive. o_O Long story short, what are the odds that a keto based diet may cause a false positive on a pregnancy test? I picked up a two-pack and am going to test again in a few days but my head is just spinning right now. 

Thanks so much for your help &lt;3


**UPDATE**: Thank you all SO much for your responses and lovely words of encouragement! I took a second test this morning that came up positive as well... so I called my obgyn and am scheduled to meet with her on Thursday morning.

I just noticed that my flair did not transfer over from /r/keto - pre-keto my HW was 238.4lbs ... as of yesterday I was 196.8... so while I am still a long ways from a ""healthy"" weight range, maybe that was enough to resolve my infertility issues? I am hoping and praying so... :) Again, thank you all, your responses warmed my heart and reminded me yet again why I love this community! I will post an update on Thursday after my appointment.

I've always loved trying new foods. For keto, this is great when it comes to trying a new veggie, awful when there is a new sugary, carby treat to sample!

About a month ago, the McDonalds in my town added iced vanilla chai frappes to their menu. I really wanted to try one, but I was good and always avoided the temptation every time. Last night it got all-time ridiculous when I had a dream that I was trying to justify to someone how it wouldn't be so bad if I tried one. I woke up to my first realization of the day. This is not a craving, this is a curiosity! 

When I crave pizza, I can easily avoid it. I make myself an equally delicious keto dinner and soon, the feeling passes and the craving is forgotten. This wasn't something I was craving, it was my curiosity being piqued. What does it taste like? Is it really, really good? Would I like it? This was not going away with time. This was a temptation I would face every time. With this realization, I weighed my options and figured a carefully planned out cheat was going to be better than some random day when shark week attacked and overpowered my willpower. I had the chance to minimize the damage. 

So, this morning I decided to grab the smallest one I they had (37g of carbs!) before going to the gym and planned on doing some extra cardio to work it off. I had a couple sips and it really was delicious. But I totally surprised myself when after a couple sips, I could stop! I had a yummy sweet snack, and yet, I felt like I could be satisfied with a couple sips. It sat in my cupholder while I thought over this realization. I couldn't just throw it out. I didn't want to waste it. I took a detour and went home and put the rest of the cup in the fridge. 

After my workout, I came home and poured the rest into ice cube trays and made the rest of my drink into 27 tiny chai frappe ice cubes. I might add them to my coffee occasionally as a treat to get that yummy flavour without too many carbs at once. 

Okay, yes, I cheated and that doesn't seem like it should be counted as NSV, but I'm totally proud of how I handled it and amazed with myself that I didn't just finish off the drink since it was there anyway. 




TL;DR: Allowed myself a sugary drink for a cheat, used willpower I didn't know I had to stop drinking after a couple sips despite its amazing deliciousness.

First off, I'm sorry if this is old news, please downvote me if this is common knowledge but I didn't find out until recently.

The calorie count on the label for the two brands I checked show you the calories you would be eating *without the  excess grease*.

You can tell by looking at the net weight on the front and comparing it to the back label. For example, let's say the net weight is ~1lb, 454g. Then on the back, it'll say the serving size is 15g and there are approx. 10 servings in the container. 

So multiplying 15x10, that's only 150g of bacon that the nutrition label reports are in the ""whole container"". We're missing 304g here.

I understand you get water loss from cooking, but... more than half a pound?

I lost 20 pounds until November and then I plateaued... and plateaued... and continued to just maintain at between 170 and 175 until January.

In January, my friend told me about Keto (he is a paramedic and learned about it in school). I had been looking for something different to try to break this plateau.

I've been frustrated. I've been pouting. But I HAVEN'T CHEATED. Shouldn't my body be rewarding me? My body HATES moving between 10 pounds (i.e. 170-169, 160-159). It's like it sees ""Oh you want to get into the next 10 pounds? Let's hang out here for a while longer.""

This was based off one of my tried &amp; true regular brownie recipe (I was a pretty good baker, if I do say so myself); I think the keto version could use some minor adjustments, but is pretty good as is.

* 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
* 2 oz unsweetened chocolate (I used Baker's)
* 2/3 cup Truvia
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 tsp vanilla (optional)
* 1/2 cup almond flour

Optional (but highly recommended)

* heavy whipping cream
* cocoa powder

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Microwave chocolate and butter in 30sec bursts until butter is melted. Stir chocolate; it should be hot enough to melt completely. If not, nuke for another 30sec.
3. Stir in Truvia until smooth. Wait for it to cool a bit, then stir in eggs, one at a time. Stir in almond flour. Since there's no gluten, it's not important to note that you shouldn't overstir. :P I added three fingerfuls of ground flaxseed, but you could easily skip that.
4. Scoop into greased mini muffin pan. Bake at 350 for 10-15min, or until toothpick inserted into center comes out with fudgy crumbs. Gently poke out with a spoon, either warm or after it's cooled (I ate some immediately and waited for the rest to cool, works either way).
5. Whip the whipping cream until stiff, then stir in cocoa powder. Frost brownie bites. (make sure you do this immediately before eating. If you're going to store them, hold off on this step until just before eating, else the cream will deflate.)
6. Eat, and lose weight!

Making 24 mini muffins gives a nutritional breakdown of 55cal, 5.7g fat, 0.9g carb, 0.9g protein per. Adding 1/2cup whipping cream and 1tbsp cocoa powder makes 62cal, 6.4g fat, 1.1g carb, 1.1g protein.

I found the Truvia had an aftertaste if I ate the brownie plain, but the whipped cream would eliminate/mask it? Not sure if stevia/splenda would work any better, ideas? Next time I think I'm going to try substituting some bacon fat in for the butter; I suspect it will be delicious. In the past I've also added chopped walnuts, or cayenne pepper, or coconut flakes to this recipe, all with good success. I think a cream cheese frosting would be delicious as well.

So after reading the [MyWifesBusty fitting guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) I realized than instead of the 36A I was wearing at the time, I was in fact a 32D!

It was silly that I had been working on my body for so long by doing keto and losing weight, but I neglected the importance of a good bra that actually fits. If you feel more confident about your body as you lose weight, you'll feel even better if you have the right bra that will not only flatter your figure but can actually make you look slimmer if the fit is right.

That's kind of to be expected since I don't ever have that much to lose. Nonetheless, it was becoming so discouraging to try get healthier that I would give up, become really unhappy with my body, try again in a few months...

I would work my butt off in the gym and eat as healthy as possible for months. I would never see a difference in my body or the scale. My clothes would fit the same, my face and body would look the same and the scale/measurements wouldn't change. I would get so angry... I felt betrayed by my own body. How could I work so hard and get nothing?

I started SS a few months ago and saw a dramatic improvement in my butt area but nowhere else. I was eating a lot of food, but not really focusing on my diet too much. I know that was a mistake, but I wanted to make gains in strength so I did my best not to worry about anything else for that period of time (about 1.5 months). My pants got tighter and I think my waist grew a little, and before I needed to buy new pants I decided to start down a new path. When I took a hard look at my body, I was upset. I wanted to look really good this spring and instead I felt like I let myself down (besides doing great with weight lifting). After not focusing on how I looked for so long, reality struck me and I thought ""ENOUGH!""

So two weeks ago I started keto. I looked at the graphs to see how much/how fast I could lose. I scoffed at them. No way was that going to happen with this body. This body that takes months to shed a single pound despite any effort. But I gave it a try. 

My boyfriend has been my biggest supporter, altering dinner to accommodate me, encouraging me to stay strong. With his support and my own determination, two weeks has entitled me to 5 lbs lost. I said it. There it is. In two weeks I have lost more weight than I did with 6 months of hard work in previous years. 122 to 117. Holy mother of god. And what did the calipers say? 27% to 25.5%. I felt so good, I didn't care that my dance in the bathroom ended with a stubbed toe and a terrified cat.

I know I don't have weight to really lose. I'm considered to be in a healthy range. But being skinny fat has driven me a little crazy. I want my body to reflect the life I lead, which is active, happy and passionate. When I see the progress pictures on this subreddit, I now feel like I could post some of my own soon. And for me, being able to say I actually have made progress, that's an awesome day. Because never, in my whole life, have I made so much progress, felt so good (and not hungry!) in such a short period of time.

This is a big deal: going back to see family, it's been 2 years since we left, and with a family of 5 flying the visit is very expensive and very special. 

I stayed mostly low carb but NOT keto. I decided to completely forgo the rice and noodles in all regular meals and keep them keto, and instead ""spend"" a moderate carb ration on my favorite missed foods as treats. I had LOTS of durian, ro-gan (sweet Chinese jerky), my share of satay with sweet peanut sauce, a few servings of various carby desserts/breads and kuehs/pratas, and as much as I wanted of teh tarik, a very sweet and milky strong tea (which was really only 5 cups on the entire trip). 

Anyway, I enjoyed myself fantastically and reckon I had in total about 1/3 the normal carbs of a non low-carb traveller, all spent on big bang-for-my-buck foods instead of inside meals. Now I'm back, and only up 2 pounds!! For me, that's incredible. Just a year ago shortly after I started keto I took ONE cheat meal of thin-crust pizza and bloated up 7 pounds. I'm sure I would have put on about 15 pounds if I'd tried this earlier.

I think having been low-carb so long has significantly healed whatever insulin imbalances I had before. Taking moderate breaks is really not a problem now! This is really good news for me, as life without durian, teh tarik, and prata on holiday would suck.

I don't even want to think about it...

Here's a little timeline:

* 2002 - Graduated high school. Don't know how much I weighed because I never felt the need to know. Size 4/6, probably 130lbs. Total hottie, have swimsuit pictures with abs to prove it.
* 2003-2008 - got a little bit bigger each year, found out I had PCOS, graduated college, got dumped, started working full time, went through a little existential crisis/binge drinking extravaganza. Dated all the wrong men. - ended up at 170lbs. 
* 2009 - 2011 - started lifting/running and checking out keto, but never committed for more than a month - 175 lbs
* 2012 - ran a half marathon in May! 167lbs (lowest weight during training and eating every carb in sight), After the race I stopped training and continued eating carbily...185lbs. But met an amazing man who took me to Jamaica and makes me smile everyday. &lt;3
* 2013 - not working out at all, KETO ALL THE WAY since May 1 2013, sitting pretty at 168lbs today.

tl;dr: A roller coaster, baby, baby.

If there's a couple things I've learned, it's these: I was drinking no where near the amount of water I needed. It really is 80% diet, 20% exercise. Plateau's are a bitch - pour more water down your gullet. PCOS is my burden to bear, my mantra: suck it up, buttercup.

I have tried pretty much that entire time to convince her that she needed to stop eating so many carbs. But she's been soooo stubborn.
I come from a family with a lot of diabetics on both sides and after finding out that I was insulin resistant I did a good bit or research and already knew carbs = not good. But I could not for the life of me convince my 70+ year old grandmother that eating basically just chicken, whole wheat bread, oatmeal, rice and grits was not the way she should be managing her diabetes. At one point in the past we had a face palm worthy conversation when she tried to convince me whole wheat toast was better for her than a hamburger patty.

Well today we were talking on the phone and she asked about my weight loss. We live on opposite sides of the US now, she knew I was dieting since December but hasn't seen me in over a year. When I told her I'd lost over 50lbs since she last saw me she asked how and I told her I started exercising and stopped eating carbs.  She was super impressed and was like ""I need to lose like 10-15lbs, maybe I should do that. What are carbs?"" So I explained what kind of carbs she should try to cut back on and that she should eat some more veggies and meat. Keto is way too complicated for my 70 year old diabetic grandma but I think she at least finally understands why cutting back on her carbs even a little would be a good thing for her. Like her breakfast for example, I told her to try making an egg and some bacon or sausage instead of oatmeal or a bagel. She was so surprised that it was actually better for her and said she would love eating that. She's really excited to feel like it's ok to eat some red meat again too.
She said her dr was wanting to get her diabetes under better control so she could lower her medications and I can't believe he didn't say anything to her at all about the amount of sugar/carbs she's been eating.
I did tell her to keep an eye on her blood sugars just in case. But I'm so proud of her for actually being willing to listen to what I have to say, and for trying to take better care of herself.

Between starting planning and now I have lost 48lbs, really changed my relationship with food (I was a diehard foodie, a writer with a standing offer from a small press for a book of food essays) changed my health (my doctor and I are pretty sure I was borderline diabetic when I started ketoing but he won't do an AC1 bloodtest because if the insurance company gets evidence that I was it could be used to hike my rates) and the Monday after Thanksgiving, the company I work for lost it's funding and shut down.  But we had paid for most of this beautiful party with friends already, and we discussed it and went ahead.

My doctor--who is an endocrinologist--fully supports my eating and in fact tells other patients that if they were like me they'd be healthier.  But he also 'prescribed' a day off for celebration.  So I did.  I can't eat like I used to, but I had things I haven't had in months.  I had some bread!  I had mashed potatoes!  I had cake and ice cream!  The next morning I had some french toast!  Now I'm back home three days later and stepping on the scale.

I was fully prepared for water weight gain and a little more.  I'm the same weight I was when I left!  It's my Delayed Wedding Reception Miracle!

I've been wanted to share for a while and figured that now was appropriate since I'm getting back on the wagon after the holidays proved too difficult for my weak willpower.

**Warnings:** 

1. Possible trigger: Eating disorders
2. The following is essentially my life story. If you're not into that here is a good place to stop.

Like all women, I have struggled a lot with my self image. Since I can remember I have considered myself fat, ugly, and unworthy. Around the age of 11 the physical self hate started. I liked absolutely nothing about myself. I went through the usual ""fix it with pills"" phase, but the pain never stopped.

Inevitably, puberty came and increased the self-consciousness and hate. Being the great example of sheeple that I am, I thought that losing weight would help me. At the age of 14 I became good friends with Ana and especially Mia, otherwise known as anorexia and bulimia. 

I was no TV example; I was not sickly thin or obviously sick. However, that's not the point of bulimia or anorexia. It's a mind set, it's a voice that says ""you're fat, don't eat that,"" ""you've eaten too much, throw up or you'll never be good enough."" Every second of every day. While I never became model thin, I shaved off 30 lbs in a couple months due to starvation and purging what I did eat. 

This habit stayed with me after that initial weight loss, sometimes better and sometimes worse. Every day I hated how I looked, despite what others told me, and despite my fiancé's clear distress over my issues. Then my man and I decided to give keto a try,

For the first time in 12 years the hate stopped. My view on food, hunger, and beauty changed. The foods that once broke me down now seem unappealing; when I am hungry I am genuinely hungry, and for the first time *ever* I looked in the mirror and thought ""hey, I'm not that bad!""

I haven't been very consistent with keto, as we picked the worst time of year to start (birthdays, thanksgiving, christmas, celebrations.... oh my!) but it has changed my life. My weight may not have made the amazing changes that others see, but my mental state is better than it has ever been. I don't hate myself anymore.

So, ladies.. Thank you. Not only has keto help me, but this community has been such a great support system. Every bit of advice and opinion I have received has been more than helpful. I appreciate your posts, your victories, accomplishments, and even the slip-ups. We're all human and I am no exception; you've helped me see this. Heck, at one point I even thought to myself ""I don't need keto, I'm not fat!"" Maybe I don't *need* keto for the weight, but considering how much it has changed my life there's no way I'm saying goodbye so soon!

Again, thank you all! I know this was a giant wall of text, but I still feel like I can't explain and thank you all enough. 

If you read this, thank you extra much, you're all amazing and beautiful people.

Just wanted to point out that you're all awesome and that we've hit (and surpassed) 1,000 readers! I've been super busy with getting married but now I'm back to be a more active moderator. I'd love to know what the xxketo community is looking for in this subreddit and if you have a fantastic idea, I'm looking for volunteers to implement new projects for this community!

As mentioned, I got into keto to lose weight for my wedding and to fit into a wedding dress that was likely mislabeled when shipped (according to my seamstress). I started this subreddit because I had tons of questions about how the female body reacts differently to the keto diet and all of you have done a wonderful job of answering my questions and the questions of other keto ladies! By the way, I went from 160 to 147 in a month and a half by doing keto and my once tight wedding dress? Had to be TAKEN IN by my last fitting. 

I did ""cheat"" on my wedding day and for a few weeks after and gained back a little bit (about 4 pounds). So if anyone would like any advice or information on going off keto/cheating/experiences, I'm happy to lend it! In any case, the wedding insanity has died off and I have the time to be a bit more devoted to both the keto diet and moderating this subreddit. My new goal is to lose the water weight I gained from going off keto and to be 135 pounds by my 1st wedding anniversary and I know I'll meet that goal with help from all you lovely ladies.

1373553415.0,29,self.xxketo,1i2yek,Motivation Tip,CymbalismofLife,34,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1i2yek/motivation_tip/,"Losing weight is great motivation towards wanting to eat better and stick to the diet.  But I know, as do many of you, that when it comes to the snack table at a party, it's very easy to lose that motivation.  Because it's just one night! It's just a few chips... I've been doing so well!

Motivation and, I think more importantly, stick-to-it-iveness, needs to be multi-faceted.  Eating well to lose weight is great, but weight loss is long term, and we can all ""justify"" eating those things we shouldn't because we aren't going to gain weight right then and there.  Find other reasons NOT to eat certain foods.  Things that are more immediate.  Other ways to distract yourself from the pull of the cupcake.

For me, I'm doing keto to lose weight.  I want to lose weight so I can wear better clothes to work.  I want to lose weight so I can be a role model to others.  I eat a keto diet because I prefer to eat a Paleo diet.  I eat a Paleo diet of as many organic foods as I can to save the planet, be more conscientious, and keep chemicals out of my body.  I buy and eat organic foods to increase their supply to others that still claim organic foods are not worth the (minimal) extra money.  I don't eat sugar because even though just one cupcake won't kill me, once I eat one cupcake, I'm eating cake, ice cream, cookies, and muffins for a week, and that much sugar and food puts me in a depressive state.  I don't eat wheat because of the negative effects it has on my body and my brain.  

That snack table at the party changes from something that might put me over my calorie limit (but not if I only eat a few), to something that I see as damaging to the environment, chemicals that will enter my body as soon as I eat them, to a week of bad decisions, to breaking me from my desire to eat a Paleo diet for the rest of my life, to dropping my promise to society that I won't perpetuate the demand of processed foods.

For me, all of these reasons help me to stay on track.  One may fail.  Even two may fail.  But by the time I'm getting to the third reason not to eat something, I've also triggered the realization that something else may be going on if I am trying this hard to reason my way into eating something I shouldn't. 

Granted, sometimes I still say, ""Fuck it.""  But it's much more difficult and happens way less often, and to a lesser detrimental degree.

Don't depend on just one thing.  Build a fortress of reasons to stay on track.  Read about your reasons, and remind yourself of them often.

As I have posted before, I feel awesome, etc etc. Thursday was a rough day though- I just felt so bloated and fat and gross. I initially lost about 7-8lbs, but that day I was back up a couple. I got super bummed out. I realize these things take time but I just felt like an utter and complete fat failure. I asked my boyfriend to hide my scale and give it back to me in a few days because I was obsessively weighing myself and it was just depressing me more. He obliged.

So Friday shark week started (now without getting too long and drawn out, I have an IUD so a ""period"" for me rarely happens, and if it does it's like a half day thing)- and I mean it was much more intense than usual. And guess what- I didn't feel bloated and gross anymore. And then yesterday I put on a pair of cotton pajama bottoms that were getting pretty tight across my butt and they are loose!!! And then later in the day, the bf commented that he could see some weight loss in my face.

So this morning I asked to please have my scale now because I feel like there is probably a lower number. This fool hid it WHILE INTOXICATED and has no idea where it could be. Is he trolling me? Possibly... but I have got to imagine he would've told me after I woke him up for like the tenth time asking for it.

So the scale victory I am hoping for today is just finding the damn thing. Just wanted to share, hopefully give everyone a chuckle. :)

What I would love to hear, from other really overweight ladies, is what they are eating, how they are controlling hunger, and portion size. I am not counting calories, but rather, focusing on the fat to protein ratio, and keeping carb intake under 20. I tend to get a little obsessive, so the calorie counting is out for me at this point. I am also only weighing once a week, at work. I can't keep a scale at home or I would weigh myself every 5 minutes.

I've been on and off with keto for about a month or so with being completely keto (no cheating) for the last two weeks and I feel great. Here is what I'm noticing. 

-I know I am losing weight but I don't know how much. I have promised not to weigh myself until Valentine's Day because I don't want to be obsessed with the number on the scale. But I have ordered smaller clothes as motivation and I fit them all. I notice other changes that leads me to believe I'm losing weight as well. :) 

-I used to get persistent headaches. When I get up in the morning, from a small nap, or when I stand up from sitting for a long period of time (working at my desk) my head would pound and I would feel dizzy. I even went to the doctor and got an MRI but she saw nothing wrong. No high BP and I got my eyes checked and everything is normal so I just dealt with it. My Dad used to get migranes so I thought it was just something that ran in the family. I noticed about a week or so ago that the headaches were gone. I keep checking everyday waiting for them to return and they haven't. I know it has to be because of keto. 

-I used to have breast tenderness and mild cramps before my period started. During my period I would pop midol like crazy the first two days. NOW..I don't have the breast tenderness at all and have taken maybe one midol and I'm fine. What kind of witch craft is this..LOL 

-I'm not trying to get pregnant BUT i've been seeing all the people that are getting prego around here and I'm getting scared. I'm putting my husband on notice that we need to be a little more careful unless we want an addition to the family.

Beware the flood gates that shall be opened.

Well, hi! I have PCOS and anyone with the disease knows that cycles are far and few between and it's been almost 4 months since I've had the dreaded thing but oh lord this is a blessing in disguise.

Usually it doesn't bother me to go long periods without it but since starting keto 11 weeks ago, I was under the assumption that shark week would regulate so I've been in constant hope. It's not just that though, my weight loss has been very very successful with a loss of 17kg so far but the last 2 weeks all I have seen is constant gain, loss, gain, loss. I knew something was wrong with my body because I have endured the worst most intense breast pain that I have ever experienced in my life. I still can't touch them right now because they are so sensitive. 

Naturally, I thought I was pregnant so I've taken about 6 pregnancy tests in the last 2 weeks (so obsessive I know). Nope, not pregnant! My ovaries have been killing me too and I have been a moody moody bitch to be honest.

The last thing was today, I had intense sugar cravings. I haven't cheated once since being on keto so I thought it odd that I would feel like this but I was strong and kept drinking water and coffee to surpass the sugar pangs. 

Now knowing that Aunt Flo is beginning her visit, the sugar cravings are gone and I feel SO happy that I just had to share with someone. I just feel amazing! I know that this wont last and as I type, I have a nagging ache in my abdomen, a warning if you will of the days to come, but right now this is bliss!

Sorry for the too much information, but thank you for letting me have my moment! You girls are wonderful and as a frequent lurker I want to wish you all good luck on your journeys and remember, ""Take care of your body. It's the only place you HAVE to live in.""

My boyfriend got me into it, he's been on for a few months now.

 Anyways, I have a friend who I go out for dinner with all the time to socialize, and while I feel I am confident enough to order acceptable food from a restaurant, she insists that she cooks this time. I mentioned to her that I was on a super low carb diet (and aslo added that it's surprising how many things have carbs so she might understand it's not just a matter of not making me pasta) so I might come off as picky, but she insisted it would be okay. I've made a few deserts that I'm quite pleased with so I offered to bring desert, because really how many non ketoers are familiar with super low carb/sugar baking. She responded saying she basically eats low carb anyways and we can just have some fresh fruit for desert. Fruit, while considered healthy by most, is super  carby and I havn't started incorporating it yet.

so here is my problem, I really don't want to break keto considering it's all or nothing, but I also don't want to be rude and shoot down everything she suggests. This also made me realise that I have no idea what kind of etiquette to use when eating meals made by other people. For example my boyfriend's mom normally goes shopping for tons of junk and does a ton of baking for when we stay at her place and I know he wont tell her not to (he's not so strict with his keto anymore) but I don't want her to waste all that money on junk no one will eat, or be offended I dont eat all her cooking, or try to force me to eat it.

It was a family event with my SO. And we stuck to keto the best that we could. (It's hard to make easier dining choices when there are seven people wanting different things). 

Things we did right: stuck to steamed or broiled seafood (NOM NOM NOM coast foods). Grilled chicken tenders, veggies and cole slaw (which has more carbs than you'd think, so be careful with that). We stuck to wines and liquors with diet sodas. We even avoided the temptation that is Lamberts 'the home of the throwed rolls'. 

Things we could have done better?
Water. Definitely did not have enough water this weekend. We also ended up with a meaty meal with gravy (which was an accident. It wasn't specified in the menu). Also, during this reception thing we had with his family, they didn't have any keto friendly foods. So we stuck to the veggie tray! However, after a couple of drinks, I found myself snacking on about six strawberries, five slices of kiwi and a handful or two of grapes.

No guilt. I'm shocked I nibbled on fruit instead of all the other delicious lookin' carby foods on that table. 

So we stuck with it, but didn't track anything. I'll report tomorrow with any 'damage'.

**I was out of town from Wednesday evening - Saturday evening for a work conference, my first time eating 100% away from home for multiple days.** 

I stayed at a Drury hotel, which offers free hot **breakfast**. The only keto friendly offerings were **scrambled eggs, shredded cheddar cheese, and sausage patties**, so I ate those all three mornings (with a tiny dash of salsa the last day because I was so bored of those eggs!).

Starbucks kept me caffeinated with **iced coffee**.

Met up with a good friend who hasn't seen me since before I started keto. **She said - and I quote!! - ""You lost, like, a ton of weight!""**

Yay!

I was wearing my black dress pants that haven't fit in a long time. And later that weekend, I kept having to hike up my jeans... these were the ones that used to barely zip up just a month ago!

**For lunches:**

Day 1 - Jimmy John's **Unwich**. (Go with what you know!) :-)

Day 2 - Chinese buffet, where I swear to you **I ate an entire plate of steamed broccoli** because I was so excited to see steamed broccoli. I also ate some of the meat that wasn't breaded... but still felt a little yucky afterwards, likely due to sugars in the sauce.

Day 3 - Local burger place, got a **grass-fed beef patty with sauteed onions and mushrooms, topped with peppered goat cheese**. Side Caesar with no croutons. Yum.

**For dinners:**

Day 1: Went to your average Americana-type restaurant, where I got a dozen **hot wings with ranch** and a side salad. Wasn't the most satisfying meal, but I was eating with friends so I had to go with what I could get. Just happy the wings weren't breaded!

Day 2: After the ""carbing"" at the Chinese buffet, my stomach wasn't very happy, so I went back to my hotel room around dinner time and ended up falling asleep really early, missing dinner.

Day 3: Munched on mixed nuts (always have those with me!) at the airport and then went out for dinner with my boyfriend when I got back home. We found a cool kebab place near the airport, so I had a **salad with big chunks of grilled chicken and feta cheese**. Yum.

I started Keto one week ago. My husband and I both need to lose weight and in the past we've done our own diets. This obviously didn't work since I think we mostly ate whatever we wanted. We tend to be food enablers and finally decided to was time to take control of our weight loss. 

I have tried low carb diets in the past and always had flu like symptoms, so I never stuck with it. I don't know what the difference is this time since I did feel ""yucky"" the first few days, but then something switched. I have more energy and my mood seems to be more even. I'm sleeping better, I'm not ""flying off the handle"", and in general I feel better about myself. 

So far, I've lost 3lbs (current weight is 196, goal weight is 165). 

I did have a NSV this week. I was taking care of my parents' cat this past weekend. Of course, they have candy (Rolos...one of my favorites) at their house. Anyway, I went into the pantry and saw the Rolos. I picked up the candy, smelled it, turned it over in my hands, smelled it again, started making deals with myself (you know....I'll only have a couple, it's just one package of candy, who's gonna know...). I stopped because I realized I was acting like an addict. I was so proud of myself because I put the Rolos away. It might sound silly, but that was my best moment so far. 

I look forward to learning more from this community. Any helpful hints for a newbie (or links) would be appreciated.

I wouldn't even know what one feels like. 

It's not shark week. It's not pre-shark week. No hormonal excuses. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm cranky and annoyed. I want to rant. Like seriously I can't read r/keto or r/paleo without being annoyed at people right now.

It came with fries, which I immediately transferred to the bf's plate and ate just one so I could feel like I was splurging a bit. *I* did that- me- miss no will power whatsoever!

I have an ice cream maker but I know there is a bag method you can use although I have never tried it.  It's very easy to make.  I need to watch calories unfortunately so the way I make it is: 

Recipe #1 

1 cup whipping/heavy cream 
2 or 3 cups unsweetened almond milk 
about 1/4 cup equal sucralose
vanilla 

I mix it all up and put it in my ice cream maker.  I don't know if it's the sweetener or the almond milk but it freezes really really hard.  I portion it out and freeze it in individual containers and then just put it in the microwave on defrost for a little bit when I want some.  I noticed it sticks to the side a lot because of how hard it freezes so you lose a bit.  Last time I put in under and ounce of vodka and it solved that problem.  (also didn't freeze as hard in my containers)  

The second one I made is egg based.  I just used this recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ice-cream-base/ but I swapped out sugar for equal sucralose and did almond milk for the half and half.  This one has a pudding like consistency and probably doesn't even need an ice cream maker.  You could put it in containers and straight to the freezer I think.  Last time I added cocoa and made chocolate.  It was awesome!  

The possibilities are endless.  I have added mint extract and grated in dark chocolate for mint chip.  I often make vanilla and then chop up a little bit of salted peanuts and dark chocolate for ""drumstick"" ice cream.  Also I just mix in a little natural peanut butter sometimes.  It's really good.  My next experiment is going to be mixing in a cut up sugar free popsicle and making creamsicle ice cream.  You can do anything.  I am thinking of getting a little cream cheese in there then sprinkling a little of the almond meal crust I use to make cheesecake on top to make cheesecake ice cream.  

This is what I love about this lifestyle.  You can find a good substitute for most things you want!

Now I'm breastfeeding and I lost 5kg of water weight in 3 days and now nearly 4 weeks later I've put on a kilo... I've been unsure of how to do this while breastfeeding... I did wait till she was also eating solids so as to minimise any effect on her. I'm not counting calories just eating Keto friendly, I figure it's important not to get too hungry while bfing. My milk has changed, the consistency... I no longer have the massive supply that was quite watery and used to spray out so I'd have to lean back while feeding so as not to choke the poor wee lass. Now it's a creamier consistency. Bubs used to be a hungry hungry baby too, she would eat alot of solids and milk, about a week after starting Keto she just didn't really want solids much... she would feed from me and then be full for ages, also her reflux has completely disappeared, I think that might be the change in consistency and not so much watery milk. She's gaining weight excellently though so no change there... except she's obsessed with my milk now... lol.

I did strict keto for about two months, and saw about a 15-20lb loss. It was great, I felt better inside and out and everyone noticed. I loved it, I loved myself, and I was excited to keep the ball rolling on my new lifestyle.

Then I got extremely stressed out with graduate school and just regular life shittiness. And on that same fateful night I was going to a grad school sponsored pizza party and you can put those two things together -- I told myself I could take some time off. I justified it because I was going to a conference in two weeks and it was going to be hard to stay keto there, then a wedding, then holidays etc etc etc. Since I considered keto a ""binary"" lifestyle, I just said I would take some time off rather than a few individual cheat days. I would come back to it, I mean, I was doing so great for so long. I had no sugar cravings, I was happy, I felt healthy, of course I'd start up again after the holidays. No problem.

Yeah right. I came back from the holidays more stressed out than ever. I was way more emotional and couldn't handle the stress of graduate school. I just found out my ex-boyfriend (who I'm still painfully in love with) is getting married this fall, and I have a big exam in April on top of my ridiculous workload. I didn't remember how I could handle all of this before! 

But then I had an epiphany last week -- it was because of keto. I was way more focused and could study without being distracted every five minutes. I woke up ready to start my day instead of hitting snooze five times. I had energy all day and didn't have to get afternoon coffee. And as lame as it sounds, seeing my stats on MFP was a little victory that I could celebrate every day, even if the clothes and scale remained the same. The little boost of confidence in myself that I could put my mind to something really added a gold star to the day.

So, I'm starting again, and I'm doing it for me. I need to get my shit together for school and regain some self-confidence that I lost during my ""break"". (And, I want to look fucking awesome at his wedding.)

So thanks, xxketo. It feels official to say this, and I know there's a lot of these types of posts out there, but just knowing that it's in writing helps me feel more accountable and motivated to do this right the second time around.

I was (am) still very active and enjoy running, spin classes, and CrossFit, but even with all that exercise I was still just maintaining. I ate well.

Jump to a few weeks ago, my wedding day is fast approaching (March 9th baby!!) and I desperately wanted to achieve my goal weight I set in 2010 when I weighed in at 220lbs. My fiancé has been doing keto since Sept/Oct and has made amazing progress!! He finally convinced me to give keto a try. I mean, hey what do I have to lose but the weight right?! :) well I am so glad I finally listened to him and got over the mentality that I NEED my carbs (bananas, yogurt, fro-yo, breads, cereals, oh and SWEETS!). I assumed that I would feel so deprived doing keto and it's the exact opposite. I am always satisfied and love the foods I get to eat! 

Bottom line: Keto is awesome. I've lost 12lbs in 20 days. 3lbs away from goal weight and finally BELIEVE I will achieve that by my wedding day! Anyone toying with the idea of trying keto just needs to TRY IT!!! :)

Pretty easy, 16 hours of fasting, 8 hours allowed to eat. The morning I was researching I wasn't hungry... until I mentally made the decision to start IF. Then my body was SCREAMING at me to put food in it. It just goes to show you how much of hunger can be mental and not truly physical.

One of my favorite late-night binge foods is straight-up cookie dough, shark week or not! I used to whip up some butter and sugar, throw in some flour, add some cocoa and vanilla extract and dig right in.

Well clearly, that isn't going to fly anymore. So I whipped up an alternative this afternoon, because my sweets craving from last night was lingering.

According to my MFP log, the whole she-bang has 327 calories. 11% carb, 74% fat, 15% protein. Changing the ratio of butter - coconut oil or substituting out the protein powder for something else will obviously tweak these stats.

It is a bit carb-heavy as it uses a scoop of protein powder, which contains sugar. This could be remedied by using another thickener such as almond or coconut powder, or perhaps even crushed chia seeds would gel it up nicely.

Here we go...

* 1/2 ounce crushed almonds (I don't have a food processor, so I put them in a baggie and smashed with a wooden cutting board)
* 1 tablespoon coconut oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 tablespoon dark cocoa powder 
* 1 scoop protein powder (I used TJ's Vanilla Whey)

Melt together the butter and oil. Add the cocoa powder and stir until smooth. Add almonds. Finally, add powder. 

Eat like a fiend. 

The graininess (and actual sugar content) of the protein powder reminds me of the old sugar-laden dough I used to scarf down, the almonds provide a satisfying mouth feel, and the chocolatiness from an entire tablespoon of cocoa powder is incredible.

I tried low fat, super high protein and moderate fat... No go. I tried a more balanced approach but always ended up binging on the carbs. It's frustrating when you work so hard and yet your body sits there looking back at you like ""What? I didn't do anything"". And my mind says ""Yes, that's right. You did nothing. HEATHEN!"". Sorry... I enjoy drama in my life.

I started keto last week and I expected the worst. But you know what I got instead? I instantly dropped 2 lbs (water weight, but I'll take it), my face is clear, my emotions are under control AND my body feels awesome. The strangest part? I don't even crave breads, pastas and the like. Maybe it's just too soon to miss them, but I'm surprised I haven't felt the urge yet to eat them.

I ate a strawberry yesterday as part of a prepared lunch (science meetings can really suck) and it tasted so amazing! I can finally appreciate the sweet perky flavor of a strawberry for what it should be. And after that? I didn't want another one. I was perfectly happy eating the cheese and meat off my sandwich and going on my merry way.

I thought I was going to suffer. But now I don't think I'll ever want to go back to that life. I eat so many vegetables, I get to have whole milk again (like when I was a kid), eat cheeses and meats without guilt.

I just feel the need to get some stuff off my chest and see if anyone can feel where I'm coming from. 

So, I'm a self-proclaimed sugar addict. I've never really had a problem with avoiding bread, pasta, or any other carby food since I started keto on January 28th. Sugar, on the other hand, has made me its bitch. 
For the month and a half I've been on keto, I've had all of 3 (4, if you count today) cheat days. All of them have been triggered by me making the mistake of eating a sugary food. I always tell myself *oh, just one won't hurt...* but that one food will turn me into a sugar-consuming shark that's been set on a frenzy. (Speaking of sharks, being on your period is a really easy way to justify pigging out on carbs, but it always *always* ends with you feeling 100000 times worse than before, siiighhhh). 

Those past occurrences aren't what's compelling me to rant to you lovely ketoing ladies. Let's talk about tonight. 

Tonight, I thought I would be a-okay with eating some ""low carb"" ice cream. Little did I know or expect, the pseudo-ice cream would trigger the same habits as any other real sugary snack, and now I'm sitting next to an empty box of girl scout cookies and a brownie. 

I try not to get mad at myself for cheating. Instead, I try to look at it as an opportunity to learn just how much of a grasp food has over me. It's becoming more and more apparent that I have absolutely zero self-control with sugar.

Just a brief background (sorry in advance for the wall of text)  
  

  I was the straight A student who wasn't popular because I was fat. When puberty hit, I ate alot everytime I was sad or everytime my period hit. I would just tell myself it's just PMS or I deserved it because I got an A in AP History. I would always find excuses on why I kept on eating.  
  

  In one of my checks with the OB, she told me that my period was irregular because I had PCOS. She prescribed BCs to regulate my period and my hormones. This made me eat more because I thought I was defective. (Crazy, I know)  
  


  I was kinda depressed as well because I was the fat-smart-funny girl who was always one-of-the-boys-but-never-the-girlfriend. This happened all through out college and law school too.  
  


  I never expected that I would get married to a wonderful redditor three years ago.  
  


  Anyway, my Husband and I have been trying to have a baby for quite awhile now, so I asked my OB if I could be taken off my BC. She said it was okay but since I had wonky hormones and irregular periods, it might take awhile (plus she said I needed to lose weight to make pregnancy easier)  
  


  Eversince I got off my BC about a year ago, I would only get my period almost every other month or every other third month or so. I also tried dieting but I was hungry ALL THE TIME.  
  


  Hubby discovered r/keto and decided to try it out around November of last year. He currently has lost around 45lbs. He encouraged me to be a keto-head too. 
  

  I started January of this year and have lost 17lbs so far and had my period for 2 months in a row. My OB was pretty surprised and happy about the weightloss and the my period. We're currently waiting for the results of my blood test to see if my hormones are ok :) PLUS this is the ONLY ""diet"" I have been in where I am never hungry. 
  

  I know most ladies hate having shark week (and I am one of them) but I'm just amazed that this is the first time ever that I have had my period in succeeding months. Looking forward to March to see if I have shark week too. Third times a charm!
  

TL;DR: changed eating lifestyle to keto. lost weight. had 'proper' period cycle 2 months in a row.

Their wedding is the reason I started keto--my boyfriend is going to be the best man, and since he's going to be looking very handsome and sharp in a tux and whatnot, I decided it was high time I lose a few pounds.

Anyway, I went to the shower today, which was a semi-casual brunch held at a very upscale lodge of some country club/golf course/whatever. Food EVERYWHERE. Tons of dessert--pies, cakes, everything. A beautiful pasta bar where they made it in front of you...

BUT, I stuck to keto. Had an omelette, a couple pieces of broccoli, a couple pieces of shrimp, and just one strawberry and two grapes. I drank water and diet Coke, and all was well.

The shower was fantastic, but I think one of my very favorite moments was when the bride came up to me afterward. Now, she and I see each other often, and we're all very good friends, but I know that last time I was dressed in a not-very-figure-flattering dress. Today, I was in one of my favorite dresses which shows off what shape I have. And she said, ""You have lost some major 'lb's!"" And gestured to my waist line.

I even posted and update recently on how I had lost 20 pounds in the last 6.5 weeks. Well shortly after that I quit losing, I even put on a few pounds of water weight. I had been eating for months only when I was hungry and was constantly coming in around 1000 cals or less. I was ok with that I wasn't hungry and I was avg. 3 pounds a week! Yay go me....until it stopped.  

Then I sat there for a week thinking different things- ""its because I got wasted and hungover at the wedding"" or ""its because I've been drinking too much diet soda"" (both of which could have been true.) So I waited and I cut out the artificial stuff...nothing happened. 

I was just continuing on each day getting less and less hungry. Then I realized I felt lazy...like I used to on carbs. I didn't want to do anything but sit around and cooking was even to much trouble.  I got me to thinking about some stuff that I read in some of taubes books about calories being reduced causes the body to reduce bmr etc. (something like that, don't quote me)

So if any of you are friends with me on MFP you might have seen me post about experimentation with my cals. Well I decided that I was going to increase my cals of a week and see how things went. I have been eating at my recommended cals or over for 8 days (well a couple of those days I didn't make it). I have lost the weight I had gained back (4 pounds) and 3 more pounds, for a loss of 7 pounds in 8 days.  But the best thing is I feel better and not lazy.  

I didn't change anything other than the amount of calories I'm eating. I had planned on messing around with IF after this, especially if this failed, but I'm gonna wait and see how my weight loss goes.  I wanted to share this with XXketo in case any of you were struggling or stalled.   It would seem that sometimes we need to eat more.

I've learned to ride through the emotional shitstorm (I invariably get super depressed one day a month. I can handle that.) I've learned to keep the pain in check. But the one thing I still cannot get under control is my stomach feeling like a bottomless pit a few days before my period is due.

In a moment of weakness last night I ripped into a bag of pretzel M&amp;Ms. It was deliciously satiating yet hollowly unsatisfying at the same time. It's taking all of my willpower right now not to walk into the breakroom and grab a packet of chocolate chip cookies or M&amp;Ms (we have free food at work - chips and cookies and candy galore. We even have bagels, a toaster oven and jam/PB/cream cheese, which means I get to smell everyone else's toasted carb-filled goodness.) Reminding myself of how disappointing the sugar was last night is all that's keeping that tiny thread of self-control from snapping.

This is why I can't lose weight consistently. I do well for 3 weeks, then I get an uncontrollable compulsion to eat everything in sight. I'm glad for keto - if not for keto I would've gone through so much sugar by now. It actually kind of disgusts me to think of how much sugar I could've consumed in the past 24 hours.

So, I pulled out my little spreadsheet that I keep. I have a scale that tells me my weight, % body fat, and % body water - all of which I log weekly. Here's what I did: 

* Multiply **starting weight** by **starting % body fat** to calculate total amount of fat (in pounds) on my body. (Actually, it wasn't my starting weight, but it was the first data point that I recorded a corresponding % body fat). I call this number **Absolute Fat**.

* Then, I did the same thing with my current weight. (weight x % body fat = Absolute Fat)

* Calculate net loss of pounds (total): starting weight - current weight = **26.4 pounds**

* Calculate net loss of FAT pounds: starting Absolute Fat - current Absolute Fat = **33.5 pounds**

Here's the rough go.  I had a moment where I thought, ""I don't think I'm fat anymore!"" and that was when I was still going from size 12 to 10.  And now I'm fairly sure that the sizes I'm wearing aren't ""fat"", but I've lost the ""I'm not fat any more"" feeling. I'm sitting on my couch wearing a size M t-shirt and size 6 pants that don't pinch or hurt and I feel completely unrealistically about my belly.  I'm doing logical gymnastics trying to sort it out, but I can't help wondering if my belly is still size 12/18/22 but I just lucked into these pants.   (or that skirt or dress or those other pants etc.)  

What made you realize you were done with being big?  Is there a trick?  I thought I had cleared this hurdle, but I'm flummoxed.

So there's probably more zeal and certitude than this truly warrants, but here it comes all the same:

I have an addiction to food. I've had an issue with binges and overeating for the last 4 years at least. Hiding my eating habits from others- I remember when I came up with some dumb reason to go to walgreens so that I could take a moment in the parking lot to wolf down a taco bell burrito. It probably reaches further back than that- I remember being a tween and coping with my mom's hospitalization by eating a pound of muenster cheese with my sister. 

I have been overweight for a very long time. It has been an issue in my relationship and in my own self-perception for even longer. When I would try to diet, it was painful-emotionally and physically. I would be powered along by little more than my self loathing, and then I'd give it up because fullness was a begrudging but reliable happiness. 

Keto has brought sanity back to my meals. It brings me back to those points when I was a kid, where I was so happy to go experience life that stopping for meals was a (sometimes unwanted) pause, not a relief. I can finally be reminded that its time for dinner, instead of slavishly waiting in anticipation.

I can eat and feel happy without hating myself afterward. And it has been embarrassingly too long since I've been able to say that. I have keto to thank, because I can finally eat a reasonable portion and actually feel satisfied. 

Fuck fruit, fuck sugar, fuck muffins and noodles and tortillas and beer. I want to feel full before I feel disgusted with myself. 

Keto has given that to me, and I am deeply thankful.",,False,,t5_2u80h,False,,,True,t3_18zla2,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/18zla2/nsv_understanding_my_hunger_and_gaining_control/,

I have been on and off low carb / paleo / keto diets since October of last year.  Starting in January after we returned from vacation to Costa Rica, I decided to get serious.  I couldn't stand the look of myself in our photos - I looked so sloppy and out of shape.

A few days ago, I finally hit my first 10 pound loss!  And today, I'm at 10.5.  The weight loss isn't super fast for me, probably because of my height and because I'm not as low on carbs as I could be (I'm below 50 per day), but  am also watching my caloric intake and staying under 1200 per day.  

I am usually pretty good about tracking my food on MFP, so you can follow me there if you want to see what I am eating.  Things that a lot of keto followers eat that I really don't - dairy, anything processed (think paleo more than keto), hot dogs. 

Thank you , xxketo, for all your inspiration.  I am so so excited to get to my GW!

If any one has advice it'd be appreciated (warning: longer than i anticipated),ThrowAway134184,30,4,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/xmhxd/rantadvice_boyfriend_is_driving_me_insane_and/,"Hey ladies, f/30/5'6"" SW: 199 CW: 171 GW: 140 

I hope this is appropriate for this sub but my boyfriend has started browsing r/keto and i don't ant him to find this there.  

So, I've been on keto since mid-may.  I've seen some drastic results with it too.  My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year, and since then he's put on 50 lbs! He moved in 4 months ago.  

This diet, as I'm sure you all know takes discipline and dedication, motivation and self-control, especially in the early stages.  You have to become good at listening to your own body, reading labels and taking responsibility for what you put it it.

Not only has he been bringing boxes of sugary cereal in the house (fine, i understand I've changed my lifestyle and he hasn't).  He horfs his food like he hasn't eaten for weeks.  His food choices are appalling.  Sugar, sugar, sugar, bread, more sugar, bread, pasta....etc.

So here is where we are at a crossroads.  I've told him he can eat what he wants, i realize he hasn't changed his lifestyle just because i have.  Makes it more difficult for me, but I can deal with it.  What i cannot deal with however, is the whining.  the constant whining that there's 'nothing to eat'.  Whining that there's not 'enough' with dinner.  There is plenty of food in the house he just doesn't want to eat it.  And also, when i go to the store, buy him his loaf of bread, and myself some flaxseed low-carb wraps, he'll eat my damn wraps and his fucking bread! wtf?! He's even compained to me, ""those wraps taste like cardboard"" then why the f****  are you eating them?! 

Now it turns out he 'wants help getting on this diet of mine' So last night i sat him down and explained it to him. Explained he'd have to look at labels, pay attention to his calories, eat more regularly, etc.  He lost interest about 2 minutes into the conversation and walked away.  This morning I woke up and half the damn cottage chese (3 servings worth!) was gone. He'd eaten it for breakfast.

I'm angry, upset, irritated, and feel he is undermining my lifestyle choice but wants me to lose his weight for him.  He  wants me to hold his hand through a diet, well i'm sorry, i'm not going to.

Am i being a 'diet snob'? I kind of feel like i may be.  But I've had it.  I've struggled through this diet trying to change my self, I feel like a diet ultimately needs to be the desire of the dieter or it won't work.

TLDR:  Boyfriend has been relatively unsupportive of my keto'ing, sees my results, now wants in.  Whines about the diet, how its too hard.  Wants me to read labels for him and tell him what he can and cannot eat and when to eat and why....etc.  I'm losing my damn mind.

Here's the deal -- Things have taken a turn for the worst in my marriage. I've been cut off financially. I'm now living on $600 a month for both my son and myself. And, well, let's face it, healthy food isn't cheap AT ALL. I'm being forced to live off of WIC, freezing my bread and milk to make it last longer and having to buy cheaper alternatives to the food I eat. As a result, I've had to give up on doing Keto strictly. I've added bread back into my diet, as well as a little pasta. For the most part, I'm still restricting as many carbs as I can, but it's really hard to do at this point.

To make a long story short, I have no support from my family because I'm white and my husband/child is Hispanic and I found out the hard way how racist my family really is. His family all lives in Puerto Rico, so the cost for them to come out here to help is not feasible. I've begun the process of looking for a job, and getting paperwork together for a divorce. 

Ladies, if you've gone through anything similar, can you offer me any advice? I'm still losing weight, I'm down 25 lbs, and I've lost 8 since the last time I posted here. I'm still working out at home as much as I can (I'm not allowed to go to the gym anymore because ""it costs too much in gas"" for me to go) and I'm just all around really stressed out and overwhelmed. Any advice for life, keto, anything is greatly appreciated. 

OH! Before I forget, I had my PT test for the Air National Guard last weekend. I've lost 4 inches in my waist so I now have a 35"" waist, I did 25 push ups (minimum was 18), failed the sit ups (miserably), and got a 16:36 on my mile and a half run (minimum is 16:22). This is a HUGE improvement from my last PT test, and even though it was my 3rd failure, my commander told me she was able to salvage my enlistment bonus for 6 more months, and I have 6 more months of the Fit-To-Fight program. This is my last chance, and I won't let myself down again.

Of course, I've dieted off and on for years prior to finally getting serious about it upon learning I was diabetic on 8/20/2012.

My insurance requires a 6 month doctor supervised diet, along with many other requirements. So, upon my first appointment, which at the time I was also seeing the doctor for the pain problems I was having due to Fibromyalgia, the doctor decided to run a full blood work panel. My A1C was within diabetic range at 7.3. This news was enough to kick me in the butt and I began that very moment with deciding I was going to take control of my life and kick some butt. For a couple days, I tried the typical diabetes diet- in which I quickly came to learn was NOT conducive to good blood sugar control. So I went to low carb, then gradually to completely eliminating grains, and then increasing my intake of fat. I researched hours upon hours each day and came to realize what I had done was essentially Keto! Since then, I've found many other Diabetics who have turned to Keto for excellent blood sugar control and weight loss! My highest weight was 358lbs. When I was diagnosed in August, my weight was 310. Today, I weighed in at 233lbs. I still have about 53-73 pounds I would like to lose and I'm confident that Keto is the way I will do it!

I love this subreddit and I find it really inspiring and helpful to come here every now and then :) I wanted to share my progress pics. 

I'm 5'7 and right now I weigh 180, the before pictures are at 190-195ish (somewhere in there) 

The before pics were taken at the end of January and the afters just last week. (end of February)

Here is my story:

Last summer I weighed my heaviest at 212. Then, I decided to start Atkins in August. I continued that until November, dropping down to about 193. Then now, after beginning again, I've come down to 180, dropping 32 pounds total since August. 

Here are some picture of me at my heaviest:
[face picture at 212](http://i.imgur.com/RWxnlgZ.jpg)
[swimming suit pic at 212](http://i.imgur.com/87DH5Zj.jpg)

During November and December I left Atkins and went back to eating how I used to. I used the holidays and my sister's wedding as an excuse, but I had planned on coming back in January, but instead I decided to do a general Keto diet and not so much Atkins, although really, they're super similar in a lot of ways. 

So here I am, down to 180 and soon hopefully jumping into the 70s (I did see 179 two days ago, but it went back up to 180 &gt;&lt;)

Pictures: (NSFW......bra and panty pics)
[body and face before and inprogress](http://i.imgur.com/NCZ92g4.jpg)

Now that I've lost some weight, and I plan on ketoing on and losing more, I cannot believe how in denial I was about how big I had gotten. That picture of me in a bikini was amazing for me to see almost a year later because I remember that day and remember being really confident in that suit...although I was larger than I thought myself to be. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Tonight I met up with my group of friends from school, we haven't all been together since the middle of summer what with working and being at university all over the UK. I started keto when I went back to uni in September and have lost 21lbs this term, possibly more I haven't weighed while being at home.

So I tried to explain Keto , and thought I did a pretty good job,e.g. I get all my carbs from veggies, eat a moderate amount of protein and use full fat things because they keep you fuller for longer. This was when the barrage of unhelpful comments started. Two of my friends couldn't be more supportive, they can see it working and I'm happier than I ever have been on any other diet. The third, who did slimming world last year and now acts like the world authority on diets, could not have been more unhelpful. She spent 5 minutes telling me how bad fat is for me, that any diet which allows full fat mayonnaise is clearly madness, that I should do slimming world because I can eat unlimited white pasta (WTF!!!). Now I appreciate that this diet sounds like madness, but I was expecting my friend to give me some credit, I'm a fairly intelligent woman and I'm studying Chemistry, I can call bullshit on science papers fairly easily. I tried to bite my tongue and smile and say ""people lose weight different ways"" but at the point she started saying my diet food was boring I lost it a little bit. I spent my days finding new amazing tasting things to eat, I eat far more veggies than I did on any high carb, low fat diet, and I don't feel that desperate hunger for food anymore. I love that I can still cook with real food on this diet, and don't have to spend tonnes of money on food that makes me depressed.

1. I used to be a Diet Coke addict. Like 2 liters or more a day, every day. I stopped drinking it cold turkey the same time I started Keto in January. I was kind of missing it lately so I figured it had been long enough that I could try having a soda here or there in moderation. So I went and got a 20oz bottle today. I took a big gulp expecting the glorious Diet Coke-y goodness that I had been so addicted to a few short months ago, annnnnd IT. WAS. AWFUL!!! I poured the rest of it out, it was undrinkable. It tasted like gross sugarly syrup which is how I used to think regular Coke tasted. I guess it's safe to say my Diet Coke addiction is very thoroughly overcome. 

2. Maybe this is just me being full of fail, but I can't shave my legs for shit anymore. I've lost enough weight that my legs have gained a noticeable bit of definition compared to the rounded fatness they used to be. I'm not used to shaving around all that.

Woke up this morning, weighed in for the week, and found that I'd finally lost enough to be under that two-something-something number! Of course, it is just a number, but it's my first major health goal that I've successfully reached.

To top it off, after work I bought some new jeans since all my current ones are too large. What size finally fit? A 16! I've honestly never worn that before...went from girl sizes to a tomboy phase and then straight into 18+ sizes. This not-quite-a-'plus-size' category is a whole new world for me.

I'm now well past the joy of ""oh, cool, my older jeans fit again,"" and to the happy annoyance of ""shit, NONE of my clothes remotely fit anymore!"" Not complaining, though these wardrobe changes are going to get expensive...

As for my personal plan, I started with the 60/35/5 ratio of fat to protein to carbs and have not increased exercise at all; just my usual, casual, day-to-day walking. After losing over 20 lbs, I reevaluated my numbers and switched to a 70/25/5 ratio. Personally, the extra fat seems to work better for me so far to keep hunger at bay. I get the extra fat by having coconut oil &amp; heavy cream coffee with cinnamon &amp; chile powder almost every morning and by putting homemade cheese sauces on hearty veggies (like Brussels sprouts and broccoli) as a side dish.

One of my favorite, quick go-to meals is to take 3-4 slices of bacon, cut them up into a pan using kitchen shears and then, when almost done cooking, add a couple handfuls of spinach or kale. Stir occasionally, salt &amp; pepper to taste and done! It also helps that I already loved bacon, fat, gristle and such on meat, so the fat part of the diet is easy for me.

When it's not feeling easy (PMS, stress, depression, etc.), those Emerald brand cocoa almonds are amazing (within limits). Also, raspberries were already my favorite berry, besides being relatively high-fiber for a fruit, so that always cheers me up as well. And I adore dark chocolate too, the darker the better, both for my taste and my diet.

It hasn’t always been easy and I haven’t always been good. I refused to calorie count Christmas, Valentine’s Day or my Birthday out of my principles of indulgence, but I noticed that even with that freedom I still ate less carbs that I would’ve have pre-keto; they just weren’t as attractive to me anymore. Anytime I stray from the path, I do my best to reassure myself that it was a one-time thing and (the real key) not beat myself up too much about it. It does pull me out of keto, and I feel so blah, that’s enough of a punishment for me without the additional mental torture. I trust that if I just get back on track, everything will start working again. And, it does.

Sticking to it 99% of the time over the past 6 months has absolutely paid off, and I feel better mentally too. I’m not completely where I want to be yet, but I’m closer than I’ve ever been before. I never before thought before that I was really capable of losing the weight I wanted to lose without being miserably starving all the time in return, or exercising like a linebacker. Keto may not be for everyone, but it seems to be for me, and I’m pretty happy about that.

Next up, with summer nearing, I’m looking forward to working in an exercise routine and thinking about the long-term. I’m committed to this plan, I don’t ever want to go back to eating how I used to, but once my weight is where I want it to be I’ll probably have to drink beer again occasionally to keep from getting too skinny :)

(warning: graphs)",Jennynot,30,7,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1cxmsv/update_two_month_stall_and_some_semiconclusive/,"Firstly this is an update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1ceav3/its_been_two_months_no_weightmeasurement_loss/), which I posted last week.

---

Essentially after two months on keto my weight loss graph [looked like this](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#5).

The advice I was given was to **drink more water**. So this I did. 

[This is my log](http://media.tumblr.com/82179fde73690c54400727d3d96cf867/tumblr_inline_mlpljxQHwb1qz4rgp.png) of my attempt to quit my stall by drinking at *least* 3 litres of water - with the added requirement that I drink half a litre of water for each cup of coffee because it’s a diuretic.

**note**: *I wasn't very good in the beginning, mainly because of the negative influence of coffee (ie if I drink 1 litre of water but two cups of coffee that cancels each other out).*

---

So *did it work?*

Well I choose to show you this in the form of a graph… because me. 

So the top line is water intake (in litres) for that day, and the weight I lost at the beginning of that day ie I’d weigh myself and compare it to the weight the previous morning.

[This graph](http://media.tumblr.com/fa7d374f747ac8f8fce80bddf5110c23/tumblr_inline_mlplkzsnZT1qz4rgp.png)

So, first thing to say… spot a pattern? It surprised me I can tell you, that the relationship was that clear… But I’ve been looking at this graph for like 10 minutes trying to figure out whether I’ve plotted it wrong, and whether it shows anything at all. 

I mean, surely if there was a causal relationship water would increase then weight loss would increase… not increase simultaneously. But then I plotted body fat % loss on there too ([new table](http://media.tumblr.com/4975003b7bbd63fe2d07b1a4ef781373/tumblr_inline_mlpm3din4o1qz4rgp.png)).

[This graph.](http://media.tumblr.com/4d5eb6572499a4894f97f7a655a90767/tumblr_inline_mlpm4dN7Sa1qz4rgp.png)

And body fat DOES follow. Water intake goes down, body fat % loss goes down, water intake goes up, body fat % loss goes up. It’s not actually that clear on the above graph - but it’s clearer if I plot the bodyfat % loss a day behind...

[This graph](http://media.tumblr.com/e5eae550587253963928e53725b9b4da/tumblr_inline_mlpmcb1TNA1qz4rgp.png).

I know it’s a pretty short time-series, so not exactly conclusive, but it seems pretty intriguing.

**TL;DR** Drink water!!!

**3 month UPDATE**: As time has passed [so has the correlation](http://imgur.com/z1eKGuY). I multiplied by BF change by 5, since that made it it easier to relate to the amount of water value. The water is the value I drank the day before. Stupidly ridiculous correlation ^_^

i started keto on 2/17, after my birthday shenanigans were completed, and i've been happy as a clam on this.  sated, fulfilled, energetic, more confident, and seeing slow but steady losses (down 12 lbs from my highest recorded weight, and i suspect closer to 15 since there came a point where i was too heartbroken to keep weighing myself).  

my husband joined me a few weeks ago and we've been quite happy and doing well with everything; he, too, is seeing steady losses and feeling better.

enter last weekend.  it was birthday-crazy; we had celebrations to go to Saturday and Sunday.  the long and short of it was that hubby and i conferred and ultimately decided to take off from the diet for these events only.  i did this with eyes wide open, knowing it would take me out of keto and that i'd be set back a couple of days - and since this is a lifestyle, not a quick fix, i was okay with that.

well, the NSV is that **i am no longer okay with that and won't be doing it again.**

""a couple of days"" my ever-shrinking ass.  this *entire week* was a total fucking nightmare while i re-adapted.  headaches, stomach upset, brain-fog like you wouldn't believe, COMPLETELY exhausted, skin started breaking out again...the first time around i had an awful cold that also had me exhausted and foggy so I had no idea what was keto and what was the cold, but believe me - I felt *everything* this time around.

and for some dirt cake, a few bready-goodies and dinner at a mexican restaurant, it absolutely wasn't worth it.  

so this morning, the fog finally lifted and i feel like myself again - that is, my better, keto-awesome self.  bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, in the mood to run or punch or do SOMETHING, and looking back at the last week saying: ""nah.  not again.""

and that, for me, is a huge victory.

**tl;dr - the cake wasn't worth it and keto flu is a bitch.**

I am 5'6"" and weigh 252 lbs as of today. I am using a throwaway because I am a little afraid to post this and a lot ashamed of it.  
  
I've been on keto for about 90 days total. For 60 of those days, I logged everything religiously on MFP. I tracked every carb and calorie and weighed myself every week. However, I had only lost about 6 lbs 30 days into my MFP tracking, and I started playing this little game where I tried to make my deficit as big as possible. When I started eating 700 calories or below just to ""win,"" I decided to stop tracking. Now I'm eating when I'm hungry, keeping tabs on my calories and carbs mentally. I stopped weighing myself until yesterday, when I saw I'd lost another 4 lbs or so.  
  
The problem? I've lost only 12 lbs according to my bathroom scale. I visited the doctor today and learned that I had actually only lost 5. I came home and cried. I have been fat since I got my period at age 11. I have tried every fad diet, every miracle pill, every exercise plan. I have tried a conventional weight loss plan. I picked up keto because it seems to work well for PCOS patients, and because I need something that can be effective while my chronic pain is unmanageable and prevents me from exercising regularly. Now that even keto has not worked for me, I feel like I am going to be fat forever. I can hardly even look in the mirror without just seething with self-hatred.  
  
The other problem I've run into is that for about a month now, eating any fiber gives me diarrhea 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating. I can eat it before my fats/protein, with the rest of my meal, after the rest of my meal...it doesn't matter. I had my macros pretty well balanced, but now I am afraid to eat fiber or even take a supplement because I know I will be miserable afterwards. Sometimes I rush to the bathroom 4 or 5 times in an evening. Raw or cooked doesn't matter (raw is usually worse). Cauliflower and green beans are safer than anything else, but I have run into trouble with them too. Now I am miserable if I try to follow my macros, and I can't enjoy my food or going out to eat with my boyfriend without knowing the horrible discomfort that will follow.  
  
Please help me. What is wrong with my body? I feel horribly betrayed and stuck in this stupid, broken body with no way to fix it. Why can't I lose weight? What is up with my sudden and strange aversion to fiber?

1375891496.0,24,self.xxketo,1jw27h,"Week 5 Update! I’m a happy, happy ketoid!",kimboosan,26,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1jw27h/week_5_update_im_a_happy_happy_ketoid/,"**Recap:** I started living ketogenically on July 2nd, went into ketosis on July 5th. Experienced lingering and depressing keto-flu for *three weeks* (dayum, girl!) and then during the weekend of July 20-21, my life utterly changed for the magnificent. I’ve also gone down about two dress sizes. 

**tl;dr version:**

So this marks the fifth completed week of living la vida keto. I’m an utterly changed human being, and people are really noticing the improvement in my energy levels and attitude. I know, most of us try out keto for the weight loss but that has truly become secondary to me. My life has improved dramatically because I am sleeping better and sleeping less, feeling positive and upbeat, experiencing an upsurge in energy and stamina that I have dreamed about my whole life, and enjoying the food I eat while never going hungry. 

This is my perfect life. Right here, right now. I’m the kind of person I’ve spent 40 years wishing I could be: full of energy, positive attitude, and happiness. Whatever keto has done to my brain is nothing less than a miracle. I’m literally crying from joy while I type this. Words fail to convey how life-changing this is for me. 

But okay, yes, weight loss isn’t bad either! I posted about actually getting into my size 16 jeans this past weekend (they are still tight, but they *do* fit!), and this week I think I’ve lost even more as my size 18 pants are now getting to the “very very loose” stage. Not “drop off my butt” but close! Five weeks ago, I could barely button my size 18 pants (which have a little stretch to them, and I was miserable sitting down but I was damned if I was going to buy size 20 pants. Nope. So, you know, I just suffered instead. As you do).

What am I doing? Well, what I’m *not* doing is tracking macros, counting calories OR carbs, or getting on the scale. My (mild) ED issues were a factor in that decision, but also, I’ve always believed that healthy living is supposed to be simple and easy (outside of dealing with things like illnesses, cancer, etc. of course). I knew from experience that I was never, ever going to get healthy or lose weight on a regimen that required militant tracking. Some people do well at that, and all power to them, but I left that behind a long time ago. When I started keto, I knew it was make or break for me: it had to work “naturally” w/out counting carbs or calories or it wasn’t going to work. FYI: IT WORKS.

I’ve been in nutritional ketosis for nearly a full month (checked by ketostix and corroborating evidence such as metal mouth and oily urine EWWWW) . During that time I’ve had a couple of beers, some wine, and even a half of a small potato one night a dinner party at my brother’s house, so clearly I have a little leeway with the carb count. I start my mornings with a high-protein shake made with full-fat coconut milk, followed by bulletproof coffee. Lunch is always my biggest meal, usually some form of meat/veggies scramble or meatballs with cream sauce and/or avocado. I follow that with a fat bomb. Dinner is more like a snack of “some form of protein” with cheese. I might have a few nuts for “dessert” or another fat bomb. I’m trying to shove more dark greens in, usually via homemade creamed spinach a few nights a week. But really, I’m SO FULL all the time that “shoving more in” is quite the chore. {insert expression of amazement here}

All my portion sizes have shrunk, and along with that so has my grocery bill. It’s amazing how little food you have to buy if you’re not feeding the ravenous carb slug in your stomach. :/ 

I have started “free form” dancing almost every night for at least 30 minutes; it’s my version of “play time” without structure or rules, when I can just play my club mix and let loose. Prior to keto, doing this was just a dream, because I was always *exhausted* when I came home from work. Now I’m looking for ways to burn energy! 

(I suspect the weekly updates from here on out are going to be pretty repetitive (and a lot shorter) but I’ll keep doing it anyway, for the sake of consistency. And who knows what might change, eh?)

I was *drenched*. I was *in pain*. But I was *not* finished off.

It relates to keto and I feel more comfortable asking a female-only community for help.

I'm 19, and I've struggled with various forms of disordered eating for most of my life. As a child I binged often and was overweight(and saw my sister being treated for the earlier stages of anorexia as my parents went on various diets); in my early teens I began seeing a nutritionist and got to a healthy weight at which point I began restricting and overexercising for years, my weight always fluctuating but never getting to where I wanted it. At the very end of high school I started having binge episodes again, which turned into bulimia over the summer. My first year of college, I tried to ""start fresh"" but the bulimia continued and was eventually tamped down to just binging again. 

So that brings us to May, where I decided to try keto. I tried. I didn't count calories at first because I knew it would probably set me off somehow. I didn't lose anything. I feel like I've gained (I don't track my weight religiously because it would be bad for me mentally). I counted calories for a few days and felt extremely uncomfortable about it, so I stopped. 

Since then, I've been on vacation (and went off keto for three days) and had several episodes of non-keto binging. I started counting again four days ago, binged in the evening and ended up with about 100 carbs total for the day. I've done well the past few days, then came my period today and so I just accidentally bounced the carb count up to 50 for tonight because I couldn't control myself to stop eating peanut butter.

Reading this all I think I see my fucking problem: obviously binging is my issue. But I feel like it isn't that simple. I've bounced between therapists since I was 13 (so about six years now) and none of them has been able to guide me anywhere near recovery - mostly just make me feel guilty or refuse to see my eating disorder as a real ""thing."" I don't really trust therapy as a way to help me. I think if I just learn to control myself I can heal, or at least keep my behavior in check. 

I thought keto could help, and I still think it can if I just try harder. But I don't think I can count calories unless I want to start the binge cycle over again. Is there still merit in trying without counting? Even for someone with my issues? I want there to be; I'm so afraid of carbs I might as well use it to my advantage. I eat carby foods only when I binge, which is when they scare me the most. But I love the foods that keto is based on, and I think it could help my depression and shitty broken metabolism that came with my eating issues.

I have about 30 pounds to lose, and it seems like I'm out of other options (particularly because I can't picture myself eating carbs in normal, non-binge because of the emotional distress they give me). I haven't even begun talking about my exercise ""habits."" What can I do to make this easier for myself?

I implore you, do not just tell me to seek therapy. I am not considering it right now.

TL;DR: I have disordered eating and I think keto might help if I could stop binging and I don't count calories. Is this plausible?

After stumbling on a recipe for Oopsie bread yesterday and finding out how easy it was to make it – only 3 ingredients, you really can’t go wrong – and driven by a desire to make something I can snack on, I ventured ahead and wa la, success! It’s delicious and tastes like angel food cake. It also tastes and has the exact texture of the sponge cakes you get at Chinese bakery stores! I’m inspired to bake them in muffin tins so then they will be even MORE like the sponge cake.  then I’m going to try to add cheese and jalapeños to it and make it a little bit more savoury. Mmmmmmmm. Lastly, I did the bf test and he couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that it taste so much like angel food cake but doesn’t have sugar or flour. WIN!

So to conclude, those who are thinking about making it need not be afraid; just do it, it is so easy, so good. Simple recipe here:

3 eggs
3-4 oz of cream cheese (I used half an 8 oz block)
1/8 tsp cream of tartar

-	separate egg whites and egg yolk
-	whip egg white with cream of tartar in a metal bowl until stiff. If it looks done, continue whipping… Do the upside down bowl test.
-	Whip egg yolk and cream cheese until smooth-ish. Mine was still a little lumpy to be honest.
-	Fold egg white into egg yolk. Gently.
-	Spoon onto parchment papered cookie sheet. I made 6.
-	Bake in preheated oven at 300 degrees and check after 20 minutes. Should be golden brown.

I counted calories, stopped counting calories, started again, started working out regularly, stopped working out every other day, consumed way too many forms of sugar substitutes, stopped eating so much low-carb ice cream (kind of)... and now I'm 8 pounds away from my original goal weight and 13 pounds away from my new one.

I know everyone's body works differently, but I wanted to share some stuff I've realized for those of you who are near my height/weight. 

Counting calories doesn't seem to be working for me. MFP (and my boyfriend) kept saying I was putting my body into starvation mode. I thought consuming less calories than my day's goal wasn't a big deal, especially if I was working out. I stayed at 168 for what it seemed like a whole month. I started to realize that maybe limiting myself *so much* was the problem. I stopped logging my food into MFP for the calories, upped my fat intake (all while on shark week) and went down to 163 in a little over a week. I was amazed considering I usually go up a couple of pounds during shark week. I also started drinking tons of water and am limiting myself to Stevia, only. 

I don't have love handles anymore, barely any cellulite, my face is slim, my ring doesn't fit on my finger anymore without constantly turning, I can walk around the house with only underwear and a sports bra and feel wonderful, and I'm almost to the point where I'm not ashamed to wear shorts. 

I hope this helps someone out. I barely knew anything when I started this diet, but reading all of your posts really helps me learn something new every day.

**TL;DR: Counting calories may not be necessary for you, but lots of water and fat is! And... don't put your body into starvation mode, and only use Stevia instead of other sugar substitutes!**

For me, the Diet To Go low-carb meals are a lifesaver. It's making the process very no-brainer, which is what I need right now. I'm hoping that once I get down 20 or so pounds and my body gets accustomed to keto, it'll be easier to maintain the diet once I go back to cooking for myself more often.

Hi ladies,

I wanted to post a quick update - and to say THANK YOU again for all your kind responses to my OP. :) I just got back from my obgyn - it's official, we're pregnant! Unfortunately my bloodwork came back with a fairly vague range so they were unable to pinpoint how far along I am (the range indicated anywhere from 3-7 weeks, or 18+ weeks but she could not detect a heartbeat yet so probably the early end of the scale) but I am going for an ultrasound at the end of the month. My morning sickness has abated quite a bit but is still godawful... I am seriously walking around feeling like there is bile at the back of my throat every step of the way. And yes, so far, bread and saltines have been the only things staying down. :(

The doc was pretty agreeable to me staying low carb throughout my first trimester, and said we would discuss adding good carbs as the pregnancy progresses, so I'm thinking I will have to look into a bit more of a paleo lifestyle for the next few months as opposed to straight keto since meat still doesn't sound REMOTELY appetitizing right now. Other than that, I'm just supposed to keep doing what I'm doing.

This doesn't bother me personally in as much as Anonymous Haters 1-20 could have something against my look or they could be irritated that I am fully clothed in both pictures and so am a lot less entertaining than the naked chicks, they could just have had a crappy day and now they hate everything, I don't care.

If I go slam someone on their weight or appearance and they feel badly about themselves because of it, it is certainly at PARTIALLY my fault! Why don't people get this?

I'd have just skipped it, but I've seen a few comments in the last couple of days where people are fat shaming in the keto subs. Fat shaming. That makes me sick and that's what pushed the snowball downhill.

Last year, I started a low carb diet by eliminating wheat/grains/starches and staying below 50g of carbs per day. I lost 36 pounds in about 5 months.

I gradually started introducing wheats/grains/starches back into my diet earlier this year and slowly gained all but 10 pounds of it back.

So, in late June of this year, I got back on the wagon and started trying to keep my carbs at or around 20g per day. I've been doing that without too much effort, although I've noticed that my calories have been in the 1900 to 2000 range quite a bit. Lots of fats are contributing to that number for sure.

So, even though I've kept the carbs low, my weight loss has been really, really slow. I looked back at what I was doing last year, how I ate etc (I was writing a blog and luckily wrote down everything I was eating daily for a few weeks.) I put all the info into MFP and noticed that even though my carbs were higher than they are now, my calories were lower.  Much lower, and I lost weight.

So, I'm going to try to stay low carb but also stay in the 1400 - 1500 calorie range from now on and see if that helps.  I hope it does.

I was really into the idea of eating lots of fats, meats, cheeses etc. They helped keep me satisfied, for sure. But, I think all those calories may be the problem, and I hate the idea of counting calories again, but I can't think of any other reason why my weight loss is so slow this time around. ;/

ADDED: Thanks everyone for all the comments and support! I guess I had just heard so often that it's about carbs and not calories that I was a little bummed to realize that it's really about both.

For example, does 1 cup of coffee with 1tbsp coconut oil + 1 tbsp cream substitute equally for a serving of cream cheese? Also, is it a perfect science?

Here's how my day started:


* Breakfast: 2 sausage patties and coffee
* Lunch: taco salad (~300 cal with measured portions). 

I was still feeling peckish, so I decided to treat myself with a few strawberries and cream (heavy whipping cream + truvia + vanilla extract, whipped). I succeeded in limiting myself to only a few (4) strawberries, but then I proceeded to eat ALL the rest of the whipped cream. I used 1/2 c. of heavy whipping cream, so that's a TON of calories - around 400 according to MFP. Ugh. Insta-regret. 

Later that afternoon, I made some egg salad (which I had been craving) with the intention of having it tomorrow and eating grilled chicken and veggies for dinner tonight. I used 6 hard boiled eggs, 1/3 c mayo, mustard powder, and S&amp;P. I ""tasted"" it to ensure that it was salted properly, but had a few too many bites. Probably 1.5 eggs worth. 


* Dinner: I hate the ENTIRE REST of the egg salad. All of it. Now I feel miserable. I wasn't even hungry to begin with.

I logged everything into MFP and ended up with a caloric intake of almost 2,000 calories (goal: 1300), 177g of fat(!!!!!!!!!), 70g of protein, and 11g net carbs. This is all according to MFP, so I'm not 100% confident in the numbers.



I've been on keto with virtually no cheats since January, and until today I had never had the urge to overeat. I thought keto had cured my ""must have more food"" drive, but maybe not. I guess it's better than binging on fries and sugar, but just the fact that I binged at all is concerning to me.



Anyway...I just wanted to see if other people ever have low-carb binges? How has it affected your weight loss?  What words of consolation or advice do you have?

Thanks!!

[Edit]: Thanks for all the support! I've always been so strict, and the weight loss has just been so slow lately that I was concerned that this would be some kind of ""falling off the wagon"" moment - but this morning I was down a pound, and shark week is due in just a few days, so I'm calling it a huge win. I tend to be very ""if it's not 100% perfect it's terrible"" about things, so I need to relax and let myself have a little breathing room. It's just weird to think that deviating from the ""ideal"" can be beneficial. It's also weird to think that I had 177g of fat yesterday and am not dying of a massive heart attack. If keto has taught me anything, it's how much I (and the rest of the world) don't know about nutrition. Thanks for calming me down!

The body goes into shock and death from liver failure.

If intake of iron is during a prolonged period of time, symptoms are likely similar to other causes of iron overload.""

I was in iron overload. Poisoning is only likely if you overdose on elemental iron in a short amount of time.

So I'm five and a half weeks in now. A little backstory:

About four years ago, I lost about 50 lbs. At my heaviest during my junior year of high school, I weighed 186 lbs, a weight at which I was totally embarrassed of my body. Somehow during my senior year, I began to drop weight as a result of being more active at a physical job and my hectic schedule. By my freshman year of college, I hovered between 130 and 135. I was thrilled, and for the first time in my life I was at a comfortable weight.

Well, as the next couple years went by, I began fluctuating between 130 and 140 depending on the time of year (I get fluffy in the winter). I was still fine with this, but I tried to be aware of my weight and keep it under control. Then I met my fiance. 

We've been together for three and a half years now. It has wrecked havoc on both our waistlines. I started eating junk like he was eating, and we ate out a lot instead of cooking because of my college and work schedule. My new normal became 145. I was becoming worried, but I was still ""ok"". I kind of still fit in my size 6 clothes... kind of.

Fast-forward to this winter. Christmas 2012. I stepped on the scale and I about died. 150. No freaking way. Not happening. I had been looking in to keto for the past month or so, so I was aware of how well it worked for so many people. On January 1, 2013, all the carbs in the house went in the trash, and I started my journey. That was five weeks ago.

I'm 5'5"". My weight is currently 138, though I have only stepped on a scale twice since I started. I know that I am losing some inches, as jeans I have been unable to wear without a horrifying muffin top emerging are now fitting me just right. I am back to my size 6 again! The pictures start on week two because I was too embarrassed to take a picture before that. I think I am starting to see a difference, but its hard for me to say. I see myself everyday. What do you think? Is it getting any better? I know that I still have a ways to go. I am not so interested in the number on the scale. It means less to me than how my body looks and how I feel. Which, incidentally, I feel so much better now that I have rid myself of the nasty carbs.

Okay...so onto the keto rage issue.

My children go to a small country school that only has hot lunch through parent participation.  I went in today to help serve, and bam: got stuck serving hot warm tater tots. Tater tots are so awful, yet smell so amazing when fresh and hot out of the oven.  I served like 500 tots, and stood next to the woman who served chicken nuggets.  
I managed to make it through lunch without breaking; while the other mom's went and ate their tater tots and nuggets, I chewed on carrot sticks and ranch dressing.   

Earlier in the month, a mom had also called me and ""told"" me I was bringing two pies to the school's pie auction tonight during my child's play performance.  They go on an extensive 8th grade history trip, which is funded through the pie auction and other fundraisers, so it's a really good thing.  

Last year a huckleberry pie went for $250, so of course I wanted to make one of those.  I have a huge amount of awesome frozen huckleberries stored in the freezer from our hiking adventure last summer.  I also chose to make a huckleberry cheesecake (think blueberry but better).  

I haven't baked for years, mostly because I know my family will consume it within minutes.  Still, I wasn't prepared for the level of self control required to embark on today.  

HOLY CRAP MAN.  I am never baking again.  Smelling the sweet aroma of nice baked good wafting out of my kitchen is hell.  Standing over a bubbling sweet mixture of huckleberry syrupy sauce to top a cheesecake feels like some form of terrestrial torture. I was literally trying to not breathe.  And I thought I was over sweet foods.  

Anyways, that's my rant about being a mom today.  Any similar stories or ways of dealing with this crap?  I have not wanted for anything sweet until today.  ",,False,,t5_2u80h,False,,,True,t3_16eri3,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/16eri3/oh_keto_rage_maybe_some_moms_might_be_able_to/,

I've been doing yoga for 30 minutes a day as a warm up then I jog for 30 minutes. I haven't gone longer in my jogs since I feel that I'm still pretty heavy and I do not want to damage my knees.

I've learned to manage it mostly by being aware of when shark week is coming. I can remind myself that it's my insane hormones, that it will pass. Keto has totally thrown me off.  Its about 8 days late now, with no signs of showing. 
 I woke up this morning, and had a full melt down because my partner did laundry and somehow not a single piece of my clothing ended up getting washed.  It wasn't intentional, he and I wear the same work uniform... but I just lost it, and started bawling. Then I got angry, about everything. About the shower not being sealed, about the house being a disaster, about my job, EVERYTHING.  It took me about 15 minutes of putting myself on time-out to get calm again.  

I'm getting really frustrated at this point, I don't know what is going on with my body or hormones.  I've been sticking to strict keto, despite wanting to eat all the cookies, and drink all the wine... and yet, my weight hasn't moved in about a week and a half (or longer).  I keep telling myself it's water weight, but shark week never arrives.  I am trying to tell myself my urge to strangle everyone is because it's coming, but I have no idea.  

Meh, there isn't a point to this rant... just needed to vent.

In Nov of 2010, I watched FOOD INC and was freaked out by what I was watching. As a child born in the 60's, I did not have to suffer as much *scientific frankenfood* as say someone born in the 80's had.  .HFCS, I did not understand the commercials or any of it until I watched the movie.  That weekend, I tore through my kitchen and put anything with HFCS outside, new bottles, packages, ALL OF IT, put it out. It was going to be NATURAL food and REAL SUGAR for me all the way!!!!  And, I was mad for Mexican Coca Cola in a bottle, made with the real sugar, I told my better half THIS was ok because it was REAL SUGAR......so here I thought that just cutting out HFCS and moderating the sweets was the way to go....until one day in Jan 2011, my better half sent me a text letting me know that carbs AND SUGAR were bad!!!  SUGAR, is obvious, but CARBS break down and turn INTO sugar.  Sugar is what feeds cancer and tumors, if you have no *carbs*, than you have no sugar, in essence, you starve the cancer that arrives and tries to make itself at home in a CLEAN and TIDY body with nothing in the proverbial fridge for the unwanted guest to munch/grow on. It made sense after we talked 
about it that Friday night, I woke the next AM, the last Sat in Jan 2011, eyes wide open and announced to him, I would be giving up carbs and sugar. And like that, the journey started! MY SYMPTOMS: For the first 5 days, I had constant nausea and a low level headache. Neither would stop, it was misery, than on the 6th day, I woke up and things were CLEAR, my sight was better, I FELT better!  No headache, no nausea......I look back now and know I would HATE to have to go through that KETO flu again, but my better half says his was at least a month long, not the same as mine, but all of us are different! I listened to Gary Taubes Why We Get Fat, and it made sense!  I went through Junk Food detox and my body is too happy to be rid of the trash! So the next step was the diet, low/no  carb, high fat....well, to cut a long story short ( TOO LATE! ) Before long, I was swimming in my clothes but not paying real attention, til I tried on a ridiculous pair of pants and I will be god DAMNED if I did not look good!  Holy Crap, what size is this?  A 6?  are you for fucking real?  Yes, a 6 and I have maintained it every since, I have not gained it back, my body weighs 140, but I wear a 6 and I am 5'3.  Eating Keto is not just a diet for me, it is a lifestyle, I love to cook so I get very creative with ANYTHING animal or FROM animal, Cheezy bacon with jalapenos, chopped hot dogs in a bowl with catsup and mebbe some onion, so MANY things you can eat.,  I love me some EZ SWEETS, it has kept me sane.  Now and again, a square of GODIVA chocolate is had, I am a woman, after all, lol, but soon I will be making my own confections. Heavy whipping cream with vanilla and ez sweets and it is cool whip with berries, Cocoa, whipping cream or half and half and ez sweets makes a safe and clean hot chocolate! 

Cheating now  and again is OK, but usually the next day in the toilet reminds you why you don't do it very often. My cheat would be Sushi ;) 
Every person is different. I am now back to what me and my better half refer to as KETO FREEFALL, we are both fasting and eating one meal a day.  The body LOVES when you do that, because you are essentially giving it time to repair itself, your stomach shrinks, and your digestion has a chance to straighten out and balance, and you lose more weight.  The last 20 lbs are always the hardest!

I want to share one more thing, I want to share a dream I had which still moves me to tears.  I dreamt I was at a nice banquet hall, and I was walking beside a table with the most DECADENT things you can imagine!  The most BEAUTIFUL creations that you would want to dibble and dabble with, but as I walked, my eyes were seeking out something I could have, at one point, at the end of the table, I saw some unfrosted poptarts, for a second my heart skipped a beat because here was something not coated, as soon as I was elated, I was just as deflated because in my head I was like *this is garbage*, I turned to look at the 4 other women, whose faces I do not recall, and I told them *I can't eat this, I can't eat ANY of this.....* I woke that morning remembering the dream and realized that I REALLY was making a huge change in my life, in my dream, I did NOT want any of the sugary things, I FELT it, and I knew, this was it! So that is why I do KETO, keeps my body clean, keeps my weight down, keeps me healthy, and keeps me from aging, sorta! And I am becoming an AMAZING cook!  I'd rather cook for myself! 

EDIT: When I decided to post this, I just wanted to share how my transformation took and give an inside idea, I got a lot of positive feedback and some cool PM's, but I get downvoted and I can't understand why, no one posts their criticisms, they are following me around and downvoting me for breathing, lol, sorry to have a voice and want to encourage or try to help someone, I am new to even posting on this site, so unless they have something to say, than they just must be jealous haters... *shrug*",,False,,t5_2u80h,1350750421.0,,,True,t3_11m9l0,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/11m9l0/my_keto_journey_since_jan_2011_what_i_do_and_why/,

Not giving up.,CakedPaletteKnife,26,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/z3ckc/nsvsv_my_story_not_giving_up/,"I haven't seen a current NSV thread, so I hope I'm not posting out of place here. I just wanted to share my venture so far. 

My weight loss hasn't been as rapid or substantial as some others' here, but it has been coming off. For my NSVs, I've had to adjust my watch band twice, and now only have one hole left! The ""fat"" pants I started in (which were loose but comfy), I now have to fold the waist band over just to keep them up, and even so they're too loose to comfortably wear. The jeans that used to be too tight fresh out of the dryer now fit like a dream, and are even loose after being worn and stretched for a couple of hours (does anyone else experience this??). On my birthday last week my mom made the amazing lemon bundt cake she always makes, and I had part of one piece. It just didn't taste good to me. But perhaps my biggest NSV is that my obsession with the scale and the number it shows has dwindled significantly. At this point, a lower number is simply a bonus. 

I am down 10 lbs. as of today, after about 1 1/2 months. Like I said, it hasn't been rapid, but I have less than 15 lbs. to go before meeting my goal. Dare I say... I can do this!?

Beating my obsession with the scale came with frustration. My life is in a constant state of turmoil, and has been for a few months. To be brief, I'm separated from my husband whom I've spent more than half my life with after discovering a string of his affairs. I sunk deep into self pity and anger for quite a while, and didn't give a rat's ass about what I put into my body. Since starting keto I've had a couple of mis-steps, a couple of nights that I allowed myself to have 2-3 beers. And I stalled my progress for those beers. It took a week and a half for me to get back on track (scale wise). But somewhere during that time, I realized that's the point that I would normally give up and I didn't. I trudged on and got right back to good habits. I realized this change is actually sticking for me, and the number on the scale hardly matters, as I know it will balance out in the end. 

Thanks for reading, and for all the support /xxketo and /keto have provided. I know for a fact I wouldn't have made this lasting change without.

edit: I nearly forgot a biggie: Last night I met my (estranged) husband at the mall to pick up my kids after work. Walking towards him I passed two attractive young men who actually turned around to blatantly check me out! You bet your ass he noticed, and the look on his face was priceless.

Yesterday, I was with friends and indulged in a bite of cookie, some wine (under 6 ounces), a couple crackers, and a mini crepe. Probably in the 75g-100g carbs range not including the wine.

I was prepared for a slight gain when I woke up. The weird thing is, I woke up lighter this morning after a couple days of stalling or even gaining. Wouldn't carbs, at the very least, increase weight via increased water retention? 

I also haven't experienced the keto flu re-do that some people do when they cheat and introduce carbs. Could part of this be because I've tried semi keto before and maybe am accustomed to going in and out of keto?

Can anyone explain why, physiologically, a cheat day seems to give me an immediate, albeit small, weight loss boost?

Maybe I'm just reading into the scale too much? I like to weigh myself every morning before coffee or water to try to get standard results.

After all that was said and done, I'd gained back about 10lbs. Keto commenced again and I got down to 141, but then in April it was my husband's birthday annnddd we indulged. Again. Since then I feel like it's been really hard for me to strictly stick to keto. I can do well during the week when I'm working and working our regularly, but then the weekend hits and there's usually something going on and I get that ""fuck it"" mentality and eat at least a little of something I shouldn't. I feel like my cravings have snowballed lately and gotten just insanely out of control and I HATE that feeling!!! That's what I LOVED about keto when I was on strictly... I felt like for the first time ever, I was in control of food and not the other way around. Sweets are my weakness. It absolutely embarrasses me to reveal this, but I'm just gonna put it out there and get it off my chest... Wednesday during my lunch hour (after I'd already eaten my keto-friendly lunch at work) I go to a nearby fro-yo joint and LOAD UP on yogurt and toppings. I sit in my car and devour that shit. Then... I drive a couple blocks to this amazing cookie bakery and buy not one, but THREE cookies. Now these are BIG, thick cookies. Devoured all three of those. Shamefully went back to work and finished my day. A few hours later I'm driving to spin class and need to stop to get a bottle of water... well I also pick up some fucking Reese's minis. What. The. Fuck?!? Needless to say spin was brutal and I felt like puking. I thought that was it... that I'd gotten my FILL of sweets for awhile. I tried to just put that shit behind me and get committed. Did really well Thursday and most of the day Friday, but then my husband (who also does keto) and I went to get fro-yo after dinner :( I've got to stop this. I never wanna be back at 220lbs and I'm afraid if I allow this pattern and behavior to continue that's exactly what will happen. Ughhhhh!!! I'm sorry to bitch and that this post is pretty pointless... I was mostly wanting to just put this out there in the universe and get it off my chest. Thanks for reading, ladies!

I'm starting day 3 this morning and I've hit 85% fat intake both days. I lost 5 pounds which is incredible since my goal is only 25.

So far my favorite part has been the bullet proof coffee - it gave me tons of energy yesterday and I wasn't even hungry when meal time rolled around.

I was afraid I would be grumpy and tired but I've found the opposite to be true. I even went for a brief run yesterday and took a yoga class. I ate 1400 cals instead of the recommended 1000 to make up for the activity.

If you're stuck in a plateau or are having trouble with sugar cravings like I did I'd highly recommend trying a fat fast for a few days.

I've struggled with my weight my whole life and have just gotten fatter and fatter and fatter.  I currently weigh 348 lbs, though I topped out at 407 the day I gave birth to my first son. 

After 2 pregnancies with GD and a lot of Reese's Peanut Butter holiday shapes, I'm full-fledged T2 with an A1C of 9 and regular readings in the low 200s. I'm a carb addict--I treat them like a drug. (Getting a fix, getting high, passing out, waking up for more.)

When I did regulated carb diets (by no means low carb, but diabetic diets), I was hungry all the time and felt miserable. I tried WW and experienced great success until I hit 10% loss, at which point the weight came screaming back. I tell you all of this as a way to introduce myself, but also to show you that I *KNOW* that keto is the lifestyle I need. But I'm scared. I'm terrified to try this.

I guess my biggest concerns are that I'll somehow make my situation worse, or wreck my health (even more?). I keep picturing myself somehow screwing this up and ending up in a hospital bed (which is where I'll be if I keep eating poorly, I know).  I feel as though I'm standing on the ledge of a burning building. Jumping is the only way I can survive, but fear of the unknown, you know?

I've read all the FAQs, but I was hoping for some personal insight. Were you scared when you started? What did you say to reassure yourself in the beginning that this was the right thing to do? Any advice from a psychological standpoint? TIA

this lead to some disordered eating in my late teens (anorexia) and then spent my twenties struggling with exercise bulemia and binge eating.  i also abused birth control and emergency controceptives and had always thought that was the major reason my period never came back when i stopped all that mess at 25.  

i started eating a cleaner diet, no gluten, no sugar, no soy(not that i ever ate much), but still struggled with binge eating and then wearing myself out exercising.  i put myself through gallstones and kidney stones with binging, going up and down in weight 40 pounds (im 5'4"" small frame i have weighed 100, i have weighted 150) burnt out my adrenals to the point my dr told me i had the hormone level of an 80 year old, had super bad depression, burnt myself out doing farm jobs etcetcetc...but i never realized that my binging on everything and super bad hypoglycemia and blood sugar issues could be due to being extremely carb sensitive.  it kind of makes sense because in my teens i was definitely an alcoholic and have that in my family(as well as eating disorders:(!) 


anyway finally, FINALLY last month, after a huuge honey and butter binge(like week long winnie the pooh style) i said enough is enough and stopped eating all carb ridden things, i had pretty much only been eating root veggies and winter squash for a few years in terms of carbs at this point but even that had become too much for my poor abused system and i would binge on carrots! seriously its possible! a few weeks after cutting carbs down to a good 50 g i am feeling like my blood sugar is super stable, although i am not super energetic.  and one afternoon after a HIIT class i start getting cramps like my bladder was going to fall out and then bang.....my period!!!!!!!!!! i was super excited because i really really want to have children, have always worried about my bones due to lack of hormones and just havent felt like a girl for a while. seriously i had only had two periods in five years before this!

i have to admit it was a pretty henious period, i was soso bloated the week before i though i was going to die or my boobs were going to pop.  i chocked it up to induction adjustment and exhaustion, moving to a new town, starting a new job, starting HIIT and yoga, a total recipe for burn out.  i was so happy when my period actually came, it definitely explained the bloating and i honored it and kept doing my best to keep low carb and continue exercising.  a little more then a month later, in time with the full moon, another period!!!!!! this one wasnt as bad as the last and now that its winding down i feel a bit more comfortable in my skin for the first time in a long time. i am way less bloated and can feel a difference in my yoga poses, lol....they are a lot easier to get into and out of, much more space in the postures!

i have about 10 pounds to lose.  even if i take my sweet ass time to lose it, i already feel so much better.  feeling more full and in control of appetite(although i am still working through a lot of the mental issues around this) great stamina during the day at work(my job is very physical) no blood sugar hangry or faintness at meal time andandand i get to feel like a woman again.  really now i am seeing my moon time as a super detoxifying time :)  anyone else who has dealt with possible amenorrhea due to carb sensitivity/insulin issues

Well, this past weekend, we were up in Scotland. I was taking a break from keto because, not to be rude, but it is pretty much impossible to get veggies in Scotland when you are eating out. Hell, it's practically impossible to get food that isn't fried. 

Out to dinner with the in laws the night before we were due to come back. This is really the first time we were together all weekend, as they were doing their thing, and we were doing ours, and prior to that meal the other children in the family were with us. This time it was just her, myself, her husband, and son.

I order an curry, as besides the fact that it's the most keto friendly if I don't eat the rice, it is what my body was wanting right then. 

Shark week is finally showing up, and my body also hasn't been happy with the carb binge that has been happening this past weekend. (Feeling bloated for two reasons now)

No sooner than the food arrived than she announced again, that ""You should join weight watchers. I think it will be really good for you!""

Oh, so the 10lbs I lost in October were nothing? You want me to go pay money to stand on a scale once a week? - It's more than the cost of weight watchers, as there isn't a group anywhere near my work or where I live, which means I'd have to pay money to take the bus to go to a meeting. I already have a long enough work day as it is (I leave the house before 7:30, I'm at work at 7:45 (due to having to get a ride from my husband who has to drive an hour the other direction to get to work himself), I don't actually start work until 8:30! Then when I'm done for the day at 5, I have to wait until 6:30 until my husband picks me up! We don't get home until 7, at which point I don't want to do anything. I sure as hell am not going to get on a bus (as he always has meetings in the evening and so wouldn't be able to give me a ride) and go to a meeting! - Not to mention, I've lived with someone who was doing weight watchers, I read through her books, I've downloaded the apps (even back in the day on my Palm Pilot PDA!!!)... and it never clicked for me.

Keto clicks. For the first month I planned out every scrap of food in MFP. Now, I roughly know what I need to eat without having to check it in MFP first. I still log in MFP, as I love seeing the macros. If I need support, I come here. I don't have to spend more money to hear other women whinging about not seeing the scale move, or example, my friend I was mentioning earlier just posted on FB, about not having gone to meetings in a while now because she was too embarrassed to get on the scale! My husband is starting to support me in the diet, and he's starting to 'get it' as he has noticed the good things beyond just weight loss (less stomach upset, heightened libido, among other things) 

I simply responded with ""I'm very happy with doing keto, and whilst doing it, all of my stomach issues have gone away.""

It's sooo frustrating!
Right now I'm off the keto wagon, as I knew with everything going on this past month there was no way to keto on. I made the conscious choice not to beat myself up for having carbs. Guess what? I've felt like crap the entire time! This entire month has been the best aversion therapy I could get as almost every day I've turned to my husband going ""I can't wait to get back on keto!

I hadn't seen much on here about how it can affect those with iuds, so I thought I'd share. 

Edit: so it seems like if you have the copper iud (which tends to make periods worse), being on keto may make it lighter and more 'normal'. For those with a mirena iud (which tends to make you not have a period), keto may make you have a period again but it tends to be light.

[Ramble],Lydi-uh,28,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1icind/a_year_and_a_half_on_keto_ramble/,"Keto is really frustrating at times. People have periods where they do well, very strictly for a while then just careen off of a cliff into a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry's, but we get back on when we come to our senses. 

These last few days I've been eating VERY few calories, like 500 or so, and noticed it is because I eat like, half a cup of brown rice for a meal or a few bites of my kids noodles for a meal and drink just tons of water. A handful of peanuts or just a diet coke.... I haven't been obsessive about what I eat or how much and when I'm not focusing EVERYTHING on what goes into my mouth, I don't obsess about food and the temptation just isn't there for the junk. 

I'll probably go back to very low carb soon, but I have GOT to chill out about the food thing. This diet has taken me from one end of the ED spectrum to the other, then back again. I'm trying to stifle the frustrated, reckless urge to punish my body by gorging myself and sabotaging my efforts but days of fasting give me a lot of power that I just trip over. 

Also, I have a slab of fat/destroyed skin around my middle that is keeping my in a size 10 pant when my legs easily fit an 8, a problem I've never had. If the skin were tighter I'd be at least kind of proportionate. At least I'm not squeezing into 22s. And there is no X on any of my clothing tags. 

Very much loose skin on and around my breasts and upper thighs have me looking like a purple and pearl zebra. There are even stretch marks from the back of my knees to my mid-calf and from my armpit to my elbow. Lovely. I want to be at my goal weight for a few months before I consult with a plastic surgeon. When I do I'll post pics of what my body looks like, but as a precursor, when people post, ""Time will fix it, your skin just needs to catch up"" I laugh at my computer. Gaining a hundred and forty pounds in a year and having three kids back to back means my skin ain't catching up enough to matter. 

Anyway, I'm excited about my fitness level and can run for ridiculous lengths of time. I get pretty grumpy when I get a chance to go for a run and it's been an hour and a half and my husband calls me to tell me the kids are up and asking for me. I take the long way home. &gt;=] But I don't hit any kind of a wall while I run and OH MY DICKENS does it make running different. There's no reason to stop running except that I run out of time. 

I have run so much since I had my baby last August. I tore the meniscus in my knee last late fall/early winter but I still run on it anyway. I run my butt off then limp around for a few weeks, then don't need to limp so much, then wait a couple more weeks before I run til it hurts so bad I want to puke, rinse, repeat. Losing over a hundred pounds... Freedom, man. 

I'm so so so so so so sick of butter, coffee, mayo, ranch, chicken and all that. I love salad, thank goodness that has limitless varieties. 

I'm not nervous about discussing keto anymore. I've been over the info so many times I think I come off as arrogant. It's really just boredom from having to present the material over and over and over to people who listen for five minutes then say, ""Well everything in moderation"" then I imagine giving their face a good old fashioned slap and that's that. 

Umm, what else. I don't know. The keto forums have been pretty frustrating so I stay away. /r/keto is just PACKED with people who obstinately refuse to read the info in the sidebar, so if I'm on a keto page, it's probably /r/ketocirclejerk. Laughs to be had there, but sorrowful ones, because its realistic humor. This sub isn't bad. 

I'd be willing to field questions. I hope that doesn't come off as hoity-toity. I want more to succeed and MOST of the usernames I saw constantly at the beginning of my keto trip are no longer around. I'm assuming most didn't make it bc they still reddit. 

Anyhoo I'm here, still losing, more of a recomp mission now, though. Liking that functional fitness. Liking getting checked out and catcalled occasionally. Liking being just as fit as my hubby. The man is military and has a schnazzy, high speed job so is fitter than most. Now we challenge each other instead of me just bitterly remembering how fit I used to be before depression and babies. 

Keto has been definitely a great tool. I recommend it. Hope you're all doing well and finding inspiration.

My keto buddy and I both set a goal to drop into the 130’s by the end of May. We were at 145 around that time and seemed like a possible feat. Especially so when I had a great 4-5 days where I was losing .8lb a day! But then I went into PISS, the dreaded 3rd or 4th week stall. And I was bouncing between 140-142 for 12 days or so and the end of the month was coming fast. So frustrating not to be able to reach a goal when it was SO close. And before you ask, yes, I was ketoing hard. I don’t cheat, I counted my carbs, net carbs were usually 15-18g a day. I drank my water, usually 12-16 cups a day. I drank stock now and there, not as regularly as I could but I got some salt intake in other places. I don’t drink caffeine. I had my macros at 70-80% fat, ~15-20% protein, and less than 5% carbs at all times. No there were no hidden carbs. I barely drank, one glass on May holiday and one at mother’s day. The only vice was I allowed myself dark dark chocolate, and really it was max 1 square a day! I was practically a saint. This was A STALL.

I was so happy my keto buddy reached her goal with a week to spare!!! I wanted to be on the same boat as her, but I was on the bumpy stalling boat. So here’s what I did:

- **introduced HIIT**, 3 times a week, 20 mins each time. I used to do insanity, but got injured in my 3rd round so I stopped to heal a bit and just worked out lightly at the gym or by playing outside. I wanted to try Keto without exercise to see how far it would go.
- **IF for 3 days**. First day was hard, but got progressively easier. 

By the end of the 3rd day of IF, it was the end of the month and … **VIOLA!!! I MADE IT! 139.4** :D *sighhhhhh* 

This process didn’t come without its challenges, but xxketo really helped me stay on track and keep ketoing on. I read about stalls, PISS, IF and so many stories that kept me focused and not feeling alone. So I want to share with you my little success too and hopefully someone in a similar situation somewhere, sometime, would read it and feel like they aren’t alone either. :) Thanks for listening!

Before, whenever I'd feel this way, I'd self-medicate with carbs and sugar. Now that it's not available anymore, I'm feeling stressed. 

It's a good thing in a way, because these are the EXACT issues I need to be dealing with. If I can get over this hump, I can free myself from food as a means of self-medicating, just a little more.

1/2 tsp nutmeg

1 tbsp vanilla

1 cup grated carrots

Soften butter and coconut oil and beat together, add sweetener then eggs until fully mixed.  In a separate bowl combine almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  Add the dry ingredients about a cup at a time letting each fully incorporate in before adding more, then add the sour cream and vanilla.  Add the carrots.
Bake at 350 for 30-40 min (till toothpick comes clean)



Frosting

8 oz cream cheese

1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

1/2 cup Truvia 

tsp vanilla

1/8 tsp salt


Beat whipping cream to soft peaks and set aside, beat the rest of the ingredients until smooth, fold in the cream (may have to beat on low to fully incorporate).

This is high calorie but also is high in fat.  The frosting is so yummy and made more than I actually need for the cake so we used it to dunk some berries in.  I combined a few recipes that I found and then incorporated some stuff from my old recipe.  Its a really dense cake, it makes enough to fit into a 9x13 dish which is what I made it in, but next time I may use a 9x9 for a thicker cake.

Then I got really, really sick. In the interest of my health, I broke keto so that I could eat traditional ""sick"" foods (chicken noodle soup, bananas, etc.). I was sick for two weeks, and have now been better for about the same amount of time. 

And I just can't bring myself to get back on the keto wagon. I had started to get back on it this past weekend, but then got hit pretty hard with keto flu and basically just said eff this, and returned to carbs.

Noob, kind of.",Linneaaa,23,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1aq1nl/hi_ladies_i_need_some_help_my_calorie_limit_and/,"**Warning: wall of text**. But I'd be really glad if you read it anyway..! Here it goes: 

   I configured MFP to keto settings last night. Didn't know it was possible until then. According to the macro calculator on /r/keto as well as my own understanding of my body, I don't really burn a lot of calories a day. My maintenance level is somewhere around 1500-1600 kcal a day. I'm a short, couch-potato type gal, 160 cm (5'2"" i think that is). So I set my calorie limit on MFP to 1200 a day, to get some kind of deficit. That's all well, I suppose. I haven't had any trouble keeping that limit. 
   
Up till now, I've had maximum 20 g of carbs a day as my goal (really only beacause everybody else seemed to have that limit, so it seemed a good place to start). With my new settings on MFP though, I realized that 5 energy% of a 1200 kcal diet is only 15 g of carbs a day. (I usually land somewhere around 18-22 g a day). This is the first day with the new settings and I dread putting anything in my mouth because I'm afraid It'll put me over 15g right away. 
   
What should i do? I can't really up my calorie limit, then I won't have a deficit. I know I should work out more, to allow more calories, but even when I do, I can't really eat more than I'm hungry for, right? Should I ignore the ""Maximum 5 energy% from carbs-limit"", and stick to 20g a day (which is roughly 7-8%)? Or should I omit even more dairy, nuts and leafy greens (my biggest carb sources) to get the macros right? Which is more important?
    
...Also, a question that might make things easier, or a lot harder. Since I started keto I've been keeping track of the Total Carb count on MFP. Am I supposed to subtract the dietary fiber from that number to get Net carbs, and count them instead? Is it Net carbs that is supposed to stay below 20(or in my case15 g) a day? If so, when looking at the Calorie breakdown in MFP, does the carb percentage in the pie chart reflect Total carbs or net carbs? Is the pie chart any help to me at all?
    
Again, sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for reading anyway! I hope someone can help me sort this out, because right now, I'm kind of confused. 

**EDIT:** I had a look through my food log, and subtracted the fiber from my total carbs for the past weeks... It turns out I'm well below 15 net carbs almost every day!

Can't stop cleaning!,MaddieCakes,23,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/17m2o4/nsv_so_much_energy_cant_stop_cleaning/,"So rather than re-typing everything I posted on my blog earlier, I'll just copypasta the fun bits. I started keto Jan 1, and here's how it's going for me now:

""**A Little Backstory (aka, “The Little Engine That (Up Until Now) Couldn’t”)**

Let’s look over my entire life thus far; bear with me, it won’t take long. Ask my mom, my grandma, Patt, ex-boyfriends, ask anyone who’s known me long enough and they’ll tell you that despite my awesome brain, charming wit, and my wonderful personality, I’m disorganized, messy, and downright lazy. (Hey, if I can’t be honest on the Internet, where can I, eh?) From my own point of view, part of my problem before was that it was mentally overwhelming. I’d start thinking about cleaning and thinking of all the things I had to do, and my brain would say, “okay, I have to do this, but if I want to do that I have to do this other thing first, but if I do this other thing I won’t have time for the rest of it…” and that train would keep rolling and rolling through the fog. It was easier to just sit down and zone out, my mind couldn’t fight through the clutter. I couldn’t fight through the clutter.

So, when I suddenly had the urge to get up and move around and clean (clean clean clean clean motherfucking clean all the things), you can imagine how I felt. “You will suddenly feel fine” is the understatement of the year. Sure, it’s only January, but I’m not sure how many more understatements will beat this one.

I can’t believe how awesome I feel. I want to clean, I know exactly what I want to do and in what order, and my mind is able to sort out things by priority; or if something comes up, I can take care of it right away and move onto the next thing. I can feel the fog lifting, I don’t ‘space out’ or get stuck in the middle of something like I used to. This is pretty huge for me, bigger than you know.

**So What Happened?**

Monday night is when I started to feel the change. I spent an hour or two scrubbing the shower and replacing the nasty plastic shelves I had set up in there, scrubbing some more, putting together/installing a new shower caddy, I swept, I mopped, scrubbed some more, but when it was over, I still wasn’t satisfied (but goddamn was I tired). Tonight, I spent another two hours cleaning and rearranging the bathroom; I cleared off and moved an antique wooden cabinet out to the kitchen, I swept under it, I got back behind the toilet and scrubbed the fuck out of everything, I got elbows deep in the motherfucking toilet to get rid of some stains. I’m slightly terrified of germs. Not like Howie Mandel levels of terrified, but I cringe and gag at the thought of even touching a toilet with my hands. Tonight, I didn’t even hesitate. Strapped myself into some elbow-high rubber gloves, grabbed a pumice stone and some bleach, and I rocked that goddamned toilet bowl. I’m still not done. There’s still so much I want to do in that bathroom, and in the kitchen. I have all this energy, and I don’t want to waste it.

**So...**

In conclusion, I’d like to apologize to anyone if I get a little picky about what I’m eating, but I won’t apologize for refusing to argue about it if you try to tell me I’m not being healthy. Look at me. I’m cleaning my house. I’m actually excited to go to work so I have something to do with my time. I’m going to the gym and lifting weights, I’m happy. I’m stronger than I’ve ever been in my entire life, I’m actually starting to see some muscle definition, I sleep through the night (which was a constant problem when I was eating shitty before), and I’m not hungry. I’m not fucking hungry.

All I know is that I’ve been eating this way for a month, and it’s done some amazing things to me so far. That’s evidence enough for me that I’m on the right path.""

* all-you-can eat Chinese buffet with my folks (I kept it low carb, but not keto--yum!)
* mom's homemade garlic bread, 2 slices
* about 14 pieces of mom's homemade fudge
* 3 magic cookie bars, from sis
* half a bag of Barbara's cheddar puffs

I'm on day 8 of Keto, and finally starting to feel great, so I wanted to post my first week's experience for those starting out - if you start feeling this, too, let it motivate you to keep going. 

**Any advice from the veterans out there is greatly appreciated!**

My stats: 5'3"" 170lbs
(I have not weighed myself since this summer, and do not have a scale, so that is my best guess and I'm going for a non-scale victory here - pics to come at day 30. I was at 189 summer of 2011, and got down to 160 summer of 2012. This is my first time trying Keto)

**Days 1-2** were fine, just realized that carbs are everywhere and in everything (and when I order something without the carb portion of the meal I get the strangest reactions!). 

**Days 3-4** nearly killed it for me. I felt like I had a terrible hangover. I had trouble controlling my body temperature, had a constant headache, and felt overall light-headed and dizzy. The awesome part (and how I knew it was starting to work) was that after a meal I felt drunk/high - the good, giggly, energetic feeling - for about an hour.

**Day 5** I started my period, and was a total mess. With the Keto Flu on top of bloating and grumpiness, I'm surprised I didn't just stay in bed all day. (FYI, I don't normally have bad periods - no cramps, not much bloating, etc., but this one was bad for me.)

**Days 6-7** were spent reading recipes on here and /r/ketorecipes, and planning work outs and runs for when I would start to feel better. 

**Today** I feel more energetic than I have in a long time. I completed my first workout (since starting Keto), and it feels good. It's truly motivating to stay on course and not cheat, because I don't want to go through the ""Flu"" again, haha. 

I've been aiming for about 20 carbs/day, and keeping a calorie deficit. My first sweets craving did not come until day 6 (which brought me here to check out low carb yum yums!), and my first non-black coffee craving (I used to have a latte nearly every day, but have been sticking to black coffee) came today. If you're having this craving too, try a sugarfree caramel latte with heavy whipping cream instead of milk. My coffee snob self would have turned my nose up at it before, but my Keto self was grateful for the low carb espresso taste in my mouth!

I have wondered how in the world anyone could be hungry on keto and I now have a theory:

Women are experienced dieters as as such we are conditioned to eat small meals pretty frequently and to treat calories as precious resources that need to be carefully doled out through the day. This doesn't work for keto! The benefit of keto is that it eliminates hunger, but you have to eat big meals to really get this benefit. I wonder if a lot of women on keto are not eating big meals and are still stuck in that mindset of constantly thinking about what you can eat next that's only 300 calories and how long you can wait to eat it. 

I routinely eat meals that are 700-900 calories. My daily routine is like this:

[Bulletproof coffee](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/) at 6AM( I use 1-2 tsp coconut oil and 1 tbs Kerrygold unsalted butter in my magic bullet)

big meal late usually between 10-2 (could be breakfast food or lunch food)

mid-afternoon snack (heavy cream and 1/2 peach is typical)

small dinner, if any

Not hungry, not thinking about food, not worrying about calories. So, I am curious: Are you hungry on keto? If so, do you eat small meals throughout the day or 1-3 large meals?

Store in the fridge if you won’t use it all within a month.
Makes 12 1/2 cup servings.

To make 1 serving mix 1/2 cup mix with a small amount of boiling water and stir

We also add a few walnuts, pecans, or almonds to add extra crunch and a 1/2 teaspoon of coconut oil or 1 tablespoon heavy cream. I think it goes best with black coffee.

I started in April with my boyfriend doing the keto thing together. Its been amazing so far - we're not super crazy strict on calories, as long as what we're eating is keto friendly we're pretty happy, and we usually do IF (18/6) and fat fasts occasionally to break plateaus. 

I'm 175cm (so i think 5'8?) and started at 80kgs (176lbs). I'm down to 67kg(147lbs) and feeling amazing. 
I've gone from an Australian size 14 to a fairly standard size 10 across the board and my shoes even fit better! 
I find i can wear heels for longer, and feel way more confident in them. 
I was going to the gym at the start but life got in the way (uni, work, family drama). I'm hoping to get back into some weights to tone up a bit before summer gets going down here. 

My goal weight is 60kg (about 130lbs) but I think that might change a bit once I get back into the gym. 

I know my loss isn't as amazing as some, but for me I am so happy with what i'm seeing, and so excited to see where I can end up. 



My relationship with my amazing boyfriend has improved - we do things like go for walks together, and cook amazing keto dinners and make our friends jealous of what we eat. A few of them are seriously considering coming over to the dark side of bacon haha!

More importantly, my relationship with myself has changed. I used to hate myself, and feel so gross and bloated and ugly. I would be upset so i'd eat, and then i'd be more upset. Emotional eating was my downfall for sure, as was boredom eating. These days there's none of that. 

I just want to say thank you so much, xxketo, for being a massive, massive source in inspiration for me to just keep going and push through the cravings and keto flu and judgement from people who just don't get it. 
I'm happy, healthy and well on my way to my goal and it's all thanks to Keto!

I just wanted to post here as an introduction, I guess. Not sure how active I'll be long term but this place has been very inspirational to me for the past two weeks, and is the reason I finally knuckled down and registered with reddit. :)

I'm on my second week of keto, I started offically on July 2nd and went into ketosis pretty (surprisingly) quickly by the 5th. That was accompanied by severe, awful headaches -- I was already on magnesium and potassium, but I upped my sodium and that made the headaches go away although I was still dealing with the lethargy and brain fog.

And I still am, a little. Not as badly as a week ago, but it seems to come and go. Kind of weird but that's okay. I'm aiming for 30 days and then re-evaluating. I will say that when I discovered and started adding ""fat bombs"" to my routine, that really seemed to help dial down the brain fog, so maybe that was due to not eating enough fat to start with (old habits die hard!).

So, anyway, part of my ""deal"" is that I don't count anything, nope I sure don't. Not calories, not carbs, not macros, not weight. Nope. For me, it's part of a big burrito of ED issues; I can't really ""moderate"" that kind of behavior, it turns unhealthy and destructive pretty quickly (I'm 43, these issues have been around since I was a girl and my mother put me on strict calorie-restrictive diets starting when I was about 12. Ugh.) Honestly, my history with diets means I can eyeball things pretty damn accurately, so I'm not too worried about going far off the ranch. I know this method will probably mean slower weight loss, but it's a mental health issue for me so that's okay!

I ""watch"" my carbs, keeping between 30-50 approximately. I came to keto from paleo, where I lost about 40 pounds when I started it in 2010. I put about 20 back on last year due to health issues (injury, illnesses...2012 was suckage). Other health issues made me take a hard look at keto and I think it might work for me long term in ways paleo didn't. I'm kind of doing the ""paleo-lite keto"", honestly, as it's a comfort zone. 

I use ketostix to gauge whether I'm in ketosis, and while I've heard arguments against their effectiveness I figure it's a good, affordable why to keep on the ball. As I said, I've been in ketosis since about the 5th (according to the ketostix) and have remained there (even despite one night out with the girls that included some wine!). Two weeks in, my clothes feel a smidge looser, but nothing drastic. 

What I HAVE noticed is an uptick in energy. I've started dancing when I get home every night, something I really enjoy and is a great stress release for me, but prior to keto I never even DREAMED I had the energy for. I work full time and am also a professional writer, and I need all the energy I can get, so having enough to come home, crank the music and boogy out for 30 minutes is pretty damn astounding to me! *pumps fist*

And that's where I'm at. I'll post updates based on my clothes size, as that's all I am allowed to make note of. Maybe someday a photo of progress?!??!? :D Here's to hoping.

My goal hasn't necessarily been a weight (although I do have 145 listed here) but it's been a size. Started with MFP in February, lost a few more pounds, then found Keto in ay &amp; have been consistently loosing even since.

In 2009 I lost about 20+ pounds just by watching how many calories I ate &amp; interval training 3 days a week.  When I hit close to my goal weight I went shopping &amp; my mom bought me this gorgeous Kenneth Cole pea coat. I got to wear it exactly twice, as I changed jobs during the winter and went from a 20 minute commute to a 2 hour commute &amp; my time at the gym became nonexistent. I put the weight back on and over the last 4 years even more.

Sunday night I decided I was going to go ""shopping in the basement"".  I have a ton of clothes that I just couldn't part with, which has been pretty useful as I've been dropping weight this time around.  I came across the pea coat.  When I looked at the tags I was really confused because I swore it was a size 8 - it's been my hopes to get back into my size 8 Kenneth Cole pea coat FOR MONTHS!  

It's a 12. Ugh. It fits just barely - my arms are still a little too big. But now I'm sort of pissed that I won't be able to wear it this winter because I am hoping to be a size or 2 less by November. First world problems, I know, but now I have this expensive coat that I still won't be wearing this winter but because of the opposite problem from last winter!

**tl;dr - I bought a coat 4 years ago that was apparently a size 12, but I thought it was an 8.

Photo on left is from August 2011 (I'm about 200ish there). Photo on right is from a couple days ago.

I didn't start my journey with keto, but once I found it, like many others, it was a huge light bulb moment for me. I've had the most stable and consistent weight loss ever since starting keto, and that's with eating all the cheese until my heart's content!

I spent most of 2011-2012 doing the more traditional better food, stop eating processed shit, and doing exercise. I lost about 20-25lbs, but over the course of the full year. I would lose very, very slowly (even with intense exercise), and my weight would fluctuate often, especially when I'd get frustrated and cheat. And because my job can suddenly turn into 70+ hour work weeks, getting to the gym gets difficult. 

Come January 2013, stumbled upon /r/keto and thought, ""Eh, let's give it a shot.""

30lbs+ and 6 months later, here I am! This makes it even sweeter because the 190s for me have always been the wall. It had previously been where I had always had the most trouble, and never seemed to be able to get past it. Now I'm 2 pounds away from the 150s and feeling pretty great! I also have not been to the gym (I do tend to at least do some heavy duty walking whenever I can, once a week usually), though I'm planning on going back shortly.

I've also dropped 2+ sizes! XL/L -&gt; M shirts, 14-16 and now wearing 8-10s pants. Never ever thought I'd ever get below 10s! Shopping recently was so much fun.

Anyways, wanted to share with you lovely ladies. Keep calm and keto on! Thanks for all the inspiration.

I started keto 3/8 and I started running 3/1ish.  Since then, I have lost 20-24lbs. Woohoo!  My heaviest was 185, my lowest this week was 159 and I'd like to be around 150.

I promised my mother -who I've been staying with temporarily for the last month and has been watching me eat a TON of meat - that I would start eating fruits and cut back on meat (aka go into maintenance mode) when I was 10 lbs away from my goal. (I've had some eating disorder issues and can get obsessive on diets, hence the promise.)

So, I'm here!  10 lbs away!  2 days ago I ""switched"" into maintence mode.  I figured some will power and cardio will see me through the transition into a more paleo diet. 

But then...I started eating carbs.  One MnM led to one chocolate malt.  One beer led to a sugar filled martini.  Sigh. 

Now I'm 3lbs heavier in 2 days (shark week also) and I feel HORRIBLE.  Gross.  Bloated, fat, cranky, etc.

So, that was the rant.  Now the questions:

How the hell do we transition out of this? 

I'm in full swing keto again because fuck it I want to loose the last 10lbs and the loss has been so quick why not.  But, I'll have to stop sometime. Eating meat and veggies isn't going to work forever.  I like the low carb lifestyle and can see passing on pasta without a problem, but I have a sweet tooth and a dislike for meat.  

Almost feeling trapped in keto if that makes sense.

I feel most comfortable posting this in xxketo rather than on the other boards. I have been doing keto since October and have had great success. I'm down 50 pounds and I've been thrilled with my results. This past weekend, I thought I'd give myself a break for Easter and allow myself to indulge in all my old favorites. Long story short, it's now Tuesday and I've been in the midst of a 4 day binge. I feel so disappointed and low and I feel like I'm spiraling out of control. I know that I'm just one binge away from going back to 256 pounds. I'm too ashamed to talk to anyone in real life. I just finished eating a huge plate of French toast drowned in maple syrup and my spirit is crushed. I just needed to put this out there...can anyone relate? How do I pull myself out of this tailspin?

Tonight, he requested we make a batch of these brownies to satisfy his sweet tooth. I made a full batch, served him one, and then proceeded to pack the rest up. I didn't crave them or have that little voice in the back of my head telling me I need to eat them.

In fact, I've had multiple keto friendly chocolate bars in the house for the past 2 weeks and they rarely cross my mind unless I'm looking to fill my calorie intake.

I'm really, really frustrated right now.  I keto'ed for a month and a half and dropped 14 lbs in the process.  Not bad!  I looked so much better, felt so much better, and genuinely felt like this is something I could stick to long-term to lose the rather substantial amount of weight I really need to drop.

Great, I'm down 14 lbs.  Everyone seems to have amazing progress when they start adding in lifting/exercise with keto, and I finally grew the balls to get my large ass into the gym.  I bought a month membership at the local rec center, and 8 personal training sessions.  I went to the first session yesterday.  She worked me really hard, and my muscles are really feeling it today.  I'm pumped though - I want to keep going, and training, and seeing these amazing results.

I'm frustrated because my trainer is not willing to entertain keto.  First thing she said when I told her I'm ketoing with great success was ""Carbs are what your body uses for energy, so eat more carbs.  You're eating way too much fat, and we need to cut that down right away.""

Literally, in 2 days of upping carbs to 15%, I've gained 5 lbs, and no this isn't TOM/water weight.  My body feels different.  My old fat rolls are right back and kicking.  IN TWO DAYS.  WTF.   She's very staunch in her position that very few people ever have reason to eat low carb.  Everyone should eat tons of fucking carbs.  

Sorry for the rant, I just am at a crossroads.  Do I eat keto and keep seeing results, or get the exercise I know I need from a person who will train me to do it properly, at the expense of not seeing any progress and feeling otherwise terrible?  

Tl;dr: Down 14 lbs on keto.  Saw a personal trainer who insisted on more carbs and less fat.  Gained 5 lbs in 2 days as a result.  Lost all visible progress.  FFFFFUUUUUU

Then the hubs tells me we are going to his parents for the weekend. Not just the weekend, but a long weekend. So, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and the bulk of Monday.

Queue me groaning. It's not that I don't like my in laws. I'm very fortunate with them in fact. But when it comes to my mother in law, she just doesn't get dieting. She's a nurse. She's also a post war child from Southern England. She will never get it.

I knew that my father in law is now on a diet, so I was thinking 'okay, maybe it won't be so bad.' (As the sister in law (who still lives at home), and her boyfriend also are on a diet, and doing low carb/slightly primal. So this means that 3 out of 4 people who eat regularly at the house are on a diet.)

Friday night's dinner. A Thai Curry.  Saw the recipe... Not horrible other than the fact that there was a tiny amount of sugar in it, but otherwise more keto friendly than I normally would have gotten at this hosue. I opted to have a 'riced' zucchini instead of rice. But the entire time, the MIL kept saying 'But you can have 50 grams of rice! It's healthy!!'
I'm almost to the home stretch for the first day. But then, out came the chocolate cake left over from the MIL's birthday. I know no one can force you to eat something, but trust me when I say.. they forced me to have some. It was easier to take a bite of the cake than to start WW3 with the inlaws. (First year of marriage... so still walking on eggshells at it were)

I could feel the sugar instantly hitting me. I went to bed feeling bloated and my tummy gurgling.

I don't remember if I woke up the next morning with keto mouth like I normally do or not.

Had a cup of tea with my usual cream in it. Found myself STARVING. I mean I was starving. Finally around Noon, they decide it's time for us to eat breakfast. What are my options? A scotch egg and beans. -.- ""But beans are full of protein!"" says the mother in law.
I politely eat what is offered to me knowing that my dream about staying in keto over this weekend is officially gone.

A few hours later it's time for 'lunch.' I'm starving. I know that this is because of the carby food. What's for lunch? My absolute weakness. Crumpets. Seriously they are a weakness of mine. I was able to hold out until I smelled the first one toasting, then I was gone.

Dinner a few hours later, again... I am practically gnawing my arm off. This was the most keto friendly meal I'd gotten in over 24 hours now, steak and salad, I passed on the grilled tomato and instead had the grilled mushroom.

Today... I woke up and instantly knew I was no longer in keto. Made me sad. Had my cup of tea with cream resolving to get back in as quickly as possible. Eggs with Salmon for breakfast, but what do they pull out to have with it? Crumpets again. I could have held off had they done their usual bread rolls, but not those blasted crumpets.

And now, just 2 hours later... I'm hungry! Damnit. I don't like this. I know it's my own fault. I could have been more resolved, but the amount of guilt this woman piles on... oy... it's horrible.

The reason I didn't do my own meals (I'm sure you were all wondering) was that they hadn't done the weekly shopping yet, so the only options in the house were quite literally just the pantry carb loaded stuff that I'm avoiding. I did bring my own bacon, and a box full of almonds that I munch on whenever I get a craving for the sweets... but sadly those didn't last long.

At least tonight will be the sunday roast, which means I can just eat the meat and ignore the potatoes. I CAN AND WILL IGNORE THE POTATOES! (Okay, that was really just me trying to convince myself that I will ignore them.)

Sigh. It's just that comment she always makes of 'Oh you can have just a little bit of ________!'
No, I can't. Because if I have a little, I'll want more. 

I tell you though.. if my sister in law comes in carrying a bag of m&amp;ms... (she's not as fastidious about clean eating as her boyfriend.. but then she's tall and leggy and works at a gym and is one of those women who you just... hate) I will most likely actually kill her... or myself. lol.

Oh, and thanks to the chocolate cake... my skin blew up. So yeah, now i feel like a bloated teenager again. Lovely. (And I had just started getting my skin under control.)

And on top of it.. I'm pretty sure that me falling off the keto wagon is the direct reason that I've been dreaming about cannibalism last night. 
Yeah.. that was fun. MEAAAAAAT. MEAAAAAAAT ANY MEAAAT WILL DOOOOOOO.  (Sorry, I have a twisted sense of humor, and if I don't laugh at the dream, I'll get really wigged out by it because it was a really dark and disturbing nightmare. Though I don't think I'm going to be able to eat chicken legs for a while.. which is funny since you'd think it was pork that I'd have an aversion to right now due to the dream.)

Makes me not want to have a cheat day because I feel like it takes away from the little bit of progress that I've made on the scale.  I have made decent NSV progress, wearing jeans that are several sizes smaller than I started (started in a 20, down to a 14).

And I'm starting to get really stingy with cream for coffee and salad dressings to keep under my calorie goal.  That's the part that sucks the most.  Yesterday I started to weigh milk vs. cream and calories vs. carbs and consciously switched to tea because it tastes ok with less cream.  Almond milk does not do it for me in coffee though with cocoa makes a decent hot chocolate.

I've had way too many sugar free gelatin cups today.  Not satisfying at all but I couldn't tell you what exactly it is that I want.

I don't think I am alone. I could post my whole sorry story but where would I start?! 

tldr: Binge eating on and off for YEARS (age 35 now), went keto earlier in this year went 6 weeks binge free! Had a serious carb binge relapse. 

So I need to clear the decks and re establish keto. Carbs are like drugs to me but I start and then the first 2-3 days are so tough my whiny little sugar b+tch wont let me push on through. I suppose I need to push through. Drink water, sleep, not expect too much till my energy comes back. That could be 3 or 4 weeks down the line. 

Why do I keep screwing this up? Argh. Carbs are so toxic to me, especially wheat/gluten. I also need to get back to supplementing with chromium, magnesium and 5htp to see me though the carb storm. My poor body, I am sorry I am coming to get you back. 

UPDATE: 25/8/12 Thank you for all the responses, very thoughtful and helpful. Today I have recommitted to keto and I have started a journal and stepped on the scales. A metophorical line in the sand. I know I have to go through the storm of sugar withdrawal but I know it will be worth it. I estimate this will take 3 weeks or so to truly feel like I have turned to corner.

I live in Texas it was bound to happen. I don’t want to talk about it. 

What I do want to talk about is halfway through my meal I felt awful like it just wasn’t worth it, and the fajitas tasted like crap. I love me some fajitas, so I don’t know if it was my bodies reaction to the carbs or a mental thing,  But I was sooo not interested in cheating anymore. I used to dream of warm yeasty rolls, Now I feel like I can survive without them.

Another positive is I am now more certain Keto works. I work up hungry this morning. Legitimately hungry. I haven’t been hungry like this in the morning since I started Keto. Which means Keto is working with my body, and making changes for the better and the positives aren’t just that I am losing weight. 

I also tracked what I ate in my fitnesspal. That is a big change for me. Cheat days used to just show up as 0 calorie days, But I am being honest because I know this was just falling off the bandwagon and I will get back on. I guess I’ve never been honest because cheat days on other diets felt like reversions to my previous self. I like Keto as a diet so I don’t want to quit it, I just sucked it up for a day, So I was honest in my sucking so new to me. 

So that’s it, My mental status on dieting has changed. This is not a fad, it’s a “way of life” . And I have finally realized that about it “diet” that it is not a way to lose weight but a change in my approach to food. I know it’s not a crazy awesome victory for most people but I am historically a quitter so failing and getting up and trying again this is a victory for me  

The picture may not be much to look at, but it is delicious. I based the recipe off the Cake Batter Shake recipe (http://dashingdish.com/recipe/cake-batter-protein-shake/)  that someone posted here recently (or on /r/keto - I can't remember).

I tried that one, but I tend to be turned off by the taste of protein powder if I'm going for a dessert-type shake, so I changed it up. Not to mention, my protein powder has carbs in it, which is always a negative. Also, I decreased the amount of cottage cheese and pudding mix to tone down the carbs, and I replaced water with coconut milk to add fat. I completely eyeballed the measurements, but here's a rough breakdown:


* ~1/3 c. full fat cottage cheese
* ~1/2 can of coconut milk (or a little less)
* ~10 ice cubes (or more, depending on desired consistency)
* 1-2 tsp of vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp butter, melted
* 1 tsp of sugar-free vanilla jello instant pudding mix

Background: I've put my body through the wringer the last 6 years. Lost 20 lbs through calorie restriction and running (which i HATED) - got down to 190 lbs. Stayed that way for a year. Was in a 12 step program for Overeaters - which helped with some emotional food issues and made me face some demons.

Got engaged and decided to lose weight. Lost an unhealthy amount of weight in a short time (From 190 - 160 lbs in 2 months). Yo-yo'ed from 165 - 175 for a year until the wedding. Meanwhile mentally torturing myself about any weight gain (.2 pounds - OMG END OF THE WORLD). Crying if I gained more than 2 pounds. Compulsively weighing myself day and night. My entire mood was determined by the scale #. I was miserable - thinner and still miserable. When I lost weight - i was on top of the world, when I gained - I was miserable.

After the wedding - I was back at 185-190 within 6 months. I just enjoyed myself...just ate whatever I wanted in whatever quality I wanted.

Been this way for 2 years now. Losing 10 pounds then putting it back on. Losing 15 pounds then putting it back on. Losing inches while I lifted and then gaining them back when I stopped. I am the definition of yo-yo. I can't even count the number of times these cycles have happened.

It's been 3 weeks on keto and here has been my experience:

Starting weight: 190.

Day 1 - 5: lost 6 pounds (water weight)

Day 7-8: gained 4 pounds (my fault - there was bday cake)

Day 9 -10: lost 2.5 of the gained pounds

Day 10 - 17: consistently @ 185.6 lb
(Getting frustrated b/c I was eating around 1,000 - 1,200 cal a day - combo of not being hungry and calorie restriction)

Day 18 - ""Forced"" myself to eat 1,700 calories

Day 19 - lost 2 pounds! Currently today at 183.4

It has been slow (3 week - 6.5 pounds) but I'm ok. I've done the fast route and it obviously didn't work so I've decided to go the slow and steady route.

Things I noticed: I don't need as much food as I always thought. I don't need as much sleep as I always thought. As I write this - I'm thinking the hunger and sleep was probably because of the carb/sugar/insulin crashes i was doing to myself...wow. what a revelation.

1) normally when i duck my chin down to blow-dry the back of my hair, i can feel my double chin cutting off air - not today!!!

2) did not realize until i started keto that i was not in the habit of chewing well. in my prior life, i could cram down crackers and sweets without really chewing. however on keto i have to chew, chew, chew, and chew some more because now i'm eating steak and spinach. those things do not go down easy with three chews. so now i'm chewing! that's awesome.

3) realized the importance of water. had my bulletproof coffee this morning, then a cup of beef boullion, but neglected to drink any water until about 10:30. was feeling really sick, then drank a few cups, and feel much better now! water, for the win!

i'm taking on keto as a lifestyle change, so i don't have a goal weight, but i'll definitely post progress pictures in a few months. anyway, thanks to all of you guys for being such a supportive community.

I'm a long-time lurker, first-time poster. I'm 21 years old, and for as long as I can remember, I've felt inferior to others because of my weight. My best girl friends are all slender and lovely, and in every social situation, I feel like the 'fat friend'. This self-hate has carried over to both relationships and career: I've never felt good enough to pursue a relationship or believed that anyone could possibly be attracted to me because of my weight, and because I am training to be an opera singer, the importance of appearance is constantly stressed to me, leaving me feeling hopeless and inadequate when think about how big I am. 


It's time for a change. 


I'm currently studying abroad, away from the normal stresses of friends, family, and study. I have a great deal of time just for myself that I've never had before, and I am determined to use it well. 

I go back to the United States on August 1 and will graduate from college the following week. I want to take beautiful pictures with my family. I want to feel like myself when I walk across the stage, not like I'm stuck inside a fat shell. 

The next 7 months are just for me. I'll be Keto-ing like crazy, trying to hit my macros every day, walking a lot, doing some Pilates and Yoga,  and hopefully a bit of jogging when the weather is warmer. I have already lost 45 lbs on Keto, and I want to go back to America 50 more lbs lighter.

So I guess in any way you guys think you can help me, please feel free too. You women are so encouraging and supportive and I hope I can receive the same response.

I'm getting rid of all the stuff that is a full size too big for me. Gonna keep holding on to some stuff that's a half size or so too big and some things that are over 10 years old and read a size 14, but fit like today's 12 (i.e. pretty much perfect for me at the moment).

I'm solidly a size 12 on bottom and Large for tops (except at Old Navy and some other places with poor sizing or cheap fabric, where I'm a Medium). Sometimes my 12's stretch out and are too big at the end of the day, but 10's are definitely too small 99% of the time (depends on brand, cut, and amount of stretch).

Anyways, I had a small stack of my favorite size 14 jeans that are way too big now in a drawer, ""just in case."" I'd already cleared out the 20's &amp; XXL's, then the 18's, then 16's and most of the XL's (again, kept some as lounge-wear, if not swimmingly big, but loose and comfy). And I recently tossed all the underwear that is WAY too big and most of what I'm currently wearing is bordering on too big as well *sigh*. Limited income, so this isn't as exciting as it should be! I just finally got *back in to* my favorite, cutest stuff from back in the day, and now it's baggy on me (baggy, lacy boyshort undies are silly, not sexy!)

Getting rid of stuff and clearing space makes me GIDDY! So, I'm trying to be reasonable and not just get rid of things because in the midst of the act I'm **high as a kite!** (anyone else like this?). 

But it's time. I'm never going back to the carb-life. I've yo-yo'd so much in the past (240 to 180 to 240 to 195 to 225 to 178 pre-pregnancy to 250 one year post partum), learned so much, read so much, and hacked my own weigh loss to this point, and have gotten thinner than I've been since I was 21. **I'm NEVER going back!** I start worrying about ""end of the world scenarios"" where I'll *have to* eat carbs, get fat, and not have anything to wear (which will just add insult to injury as I fight to survive on two spoons of rice a day or whatever; yeah it's nuts, but how my mind works when trying to figure out why I feel insecure and panicky when contemplating getting rid of jeans I'll never wear if I stay my current weight, or lose more as planned). Again, anyone else this nuts? : )

I'm expecting that, too--the one time in my life when I was thin(ish), I was a 36B. That was in high school. Currently, I am 20 years old and a 40G (thanks, /r/abrathatfits!), but I can make a 42DD fit if I need to.

I did my first fat fast to bust up a two week stall at 155/156. I focused on 1000 cals/day at 85%+ fat. At day 3 shark week came, very unexpectedly. I was prepared to do battle with PB fat bombs, bacon and (essentially) chocolate pudding/vanilla icing (1pt sour cream, 3pt mascarpone cheese and either a tsp of unsweetened cocoa powder or 1 tsp vanilla extract). Got a little off track at the end of day four. Was feeling like total shit and ended up eating about 200 cal of chicken breast and 150 cal of cheese which perked me right up. Got on the scale this morning and dropped 5 muthafuggin pounds! There was much dancing in the bathroom this morning.

""I should give up on life.""  etc.  This last time he was losing things like his wallet, phone, car keys due to lack of even caring about his most important items (thankfully I found them all safe in the house or his car).  He wasn't able to get out of bed and even go to work due to the depression, so I got him into a psych hospital for dual diagnosis alcohol abuse/depression

my story: interestingly enough, I am a crisis therapist, and pretty much deal with these types of situations for my work.

I just don't get it. I thought I made it past the hard parts for someone who just started. What is it about today? I wish it would go away. I don't want to try and use a replacement like keto cheesecake because the fake sugar makes me feel hungrier later. It would just make it worse in the end.

1358885276.0,16,self.xxketo,172obw,Keto versus low(er) carb?,enilcycyxodk,21,5,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/172obw/keto_versus_lower_carb/,"Hi ladies of xxketo,

I'm about halfway into an effort to lose around 45 pounds, using regular old calorie counting, and am intrigued by keto, but have some questions (some lady-specific, others not). 

I've noticed through the natural course of counting calories that I have shifted towards eating fewer carbs, simply because they are less filling and higher calorie than I ever realized before I started. I give keto and other low carb communities huge credit for continually advocating that people be more thoughtful about carb intake. I really do believe our society eats an insane amount of carbs. But, it seems like going full-keto results in real sacrifices, so I'm wondering what the extra benefits of keto are, versus someone who eats, say, 100-150 net carbs. My initial gut reaction to keto is that it makes intuitive sense to tell people to cut down or eliminate bread, rice, pasta, and processed carbs, but it is weirder to me to say to heavily restrict fruit and some vegetables, and maybe even high quality carbs in moderation (like oat bran for pooping). Thus, it seems that it all boils down to benefits (and drawbacks?) of being in ketosis itself, as you can essentially eat all the fruit and veggies you like on a 100-150 carb diet, but will likely lose the benefit of being in ketosis.

Some random observations:

1) Ketosis is famed for being amazing at burning fat. However, just observing the keto subreddits versus the other losing-weight subreddits, I don't actually notice a big difference in loss rate, especially for ladies. It seems like there are wide varieties of results in both communities, and both communities have big successes as well as plenty of people having trouble. 

2) Some people say the benefit of keto is not having to count calories, but you still have to count carbs. It also seems to be the growing consensus that, especially for women, counting calories is also usually recommended, and unlimited amounts of keto friendly food will probably make you gain weight. 

3) Even though you should probably count calories, keto is supposed to be great for satiation and feeling full - no deprivation, so it's easier! But, in that case, it seems like a 100-150 net carb diet would be nearly as good, or even better(?). 

4) Keto is also famed for being delicious. But, while I like bacon as much as the next gal, I also love fresh fruits and keto-unfriendly vegetables. Most keto food porn actually turns me off to the diet :/.

So, from my perspective, it seems like you get many of the benefits of the keto diet, and fewer drawbacks, with lower-carb plus calorie counting. The question then is ketosis itself, which is the only real difference between the two. 

From what I've seen, the benefits of ketosis can be (for some people): increased energy and improved mood, faster weight loss, clearer brain, improved sleep.

The drawbacks of ketosis can be (for some people): heart palpitations/lightheadedness, hair loss, keto flu (at the beginning), keto brain fog, messed up periods, constipation, smelly vaginal secretions/urine/breath, diminished athletic performance, problems sleeping.

(Sidenote: I know that low carb/keto seems to be often recommended for women with PCOS, which is awesome, but I don't have PCOS, so am wondering about the situation for others.)

TLDR: Keto versus lower carb (100-150 net carbs). Has anyone tried both? What am I missing here in thinking that keto seems to be a lot of sacrifice for something that can be achieved with a somewhat less restrictive approach? I must be missing something, as keto seems to be so incredibly popular.

Three months ago... I was around 220 lbs, wearing too-tight size 18W pants. Really I should've been wearing 20W but I couldn't bring myself to buy anything bigger. My XL tops were tight on me also. My size 6.5 engagement ring fit perfectly on my ring finger.

Now! I weighed in on Saturday &lt;200, at 198.6! I'm in a size 14 for pants (I have some 12s that I fit into but a little too tight!) and I'm in a medium for tops. My engagement ring now fits my middle finger! I'm pretty much back down to where I was 3 years ago after graduating college! Also at work, we recently ordered faculty t-shirts.. the person in charge recommended a medium for me, which completely surprised me! 

I saw my soon to be sister in law last weekend and she was amazed by how much I had changed since I last saw her (a couple weeks after I started). 

Other changes? I started out in a 38F bra (as measured by the guide provided by /r/abrathatfits) and now I'm in a 32GG!

We don't have a lot of it in the house since my fiance needs to be gluten free for dietary reasons. My only weakness has been rice, which is probably the ONLY thing I really miss. However, going to my mom's house is rough as she's vegan and all she has in her house is carbs. She keeps trying to force things down my mouth that I cannot eat, which is frustrating.

I jog 2-3 times a week for 7 km (always have for the past 5 years, I'm 22 now &amp; got quite the bit of muscle on my legs :D) but never lost weight so decided to look over my diet, lurked on reddit and found r/keto!

Been in ketosis for a week now. Don't have a scale so no clue if I've lost any. Will check in a few days though.

Also, I used ShapeUp app on android to track my calorie intake, past 2 weeks I noticed I tended to land around 1000 cals per day and I thought that was ok but [using the keto calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) it tells me I need around 1400 cals :S Is this something I should ignore (2800 cals per week than recommended) or should I stuff myself with some bacon and eggs before bedtime? :P

So, instead of doing the old and tired ""over-the-hill"" theme for the party, I thought it would be a great idea to do a ""still-haven't-lost-your-shine"" party with gold as a theme. 

Then, I had this great idea to get some of those little ferrero rocher hazlenut candies because they are wrapped in gold wrappers, and my mom loves them. Well, I did most of my shopping on Wednesday, but I didn't buy them on Wednesday because I thought to myself, ""icussr, you don't need all that candy sitting in your house temping you to mess up your diet."" 

So I bought them today-- first thing this morning. They're super cheap at Costco, and you know that my weak-willed, overly rationalizing mind  had just one pack at first. And then it was three. And then it was five. 

In all, I ate thirty of those little nuggets of glorious sugary goodness. I wish I could say that I didn't realize it, and that I lost my mind... but I knew what I was doing with each bite. I just couldn't stop myself. This is why I'm fat in the first place-- because there are some foods that I just can't stay out of. 

And a little tiny voice in my head said, ""man... for someone who has their life together, you really need professional help."" That made me angry, and I wanted someone to be angry at. It's hard to be angry at your own thoughts though. 

In 2005, I weighed over 300 pounds. I got down to 170 with a severely calorie-restricted diet (900 calories a day) and loads of exercise. I got hurt in a new Crossfit gym, though, and a lot of the activities I love cause extreme pain. I'm 213 now, where I've been for about a week due to various exercises in self-sabotage. Today was the worst, by far, though. I've never gone back up over 230, so I'm keeping 70+ pounds off... but that feels so small and insignificant compared to the fact that I keep ballooning up 50 pounds at a time.

I have a routine on work days: I pack breakfast &amp; lunch, drink my water (2 jugs in the morning, 3 in the afternoon and BAM there's 15 cups of water or almost 4 litres), I log. On weekends, nooooottt so great. I'm a little less strict on logging, and since my bf and I will eat out at least 2-3 times with friends or just us, I don't know how many carbs are in the meals even if they are 'keto friendly'. Needless to say, I usually would feel less than proud of myself come Monday morning... **but not this Monday, baby!** 

I was SO GOOD. Let's realize that it wasn't just any other weekend but Mother's day weekend. I survived two family meals. **Here are some NSV:**

- logged every meal this weekend
- drank enough water to drown myself
- made over 2+ dozens of chocolate covered strawberries for the my mom and my bf's mom on Saturday AND Sunday = did not eat even one! Instead I ate one low carb cheesecake, spoon of whipped cream, and cut up one strawberry as a treat. I even drizzled a little bit of chocolate in. The. Best. All while bf was licking his fingers, spoons, and pretty much drinking the left over chocolate.
- brought an egg salad to dim sum because mom wanted dimsum and I know it's near IMPOSSIBLE to get low carb things there. No one cared that I'm eating my own food and everyone had a great time.
- watched bf's family eat the mountains of sweets they have at their house while we were playing games. Just said 'no thanks'. (ps. they are all in great shape! like muscular and cut for the guys, thin for the ladies. argh genetics!?)
- made oopsie bread and packed it to dinner, used it to dip the lobster oil while everyone else used bread
- I'm usually a 2 glass of red kinda gal at dinners, but had only a few sips of the sweet, sweet Zinfandel (bottle of choice for the table) - everyone insists that it wasn't sweet at all. I wonder if it's because I haven't eaten sweet things for awhile that it's just like flavour explosion.
- chose steak twice while out for dinner. Sunday night's was an 18oz t-bone rib eye steak. the waiter was looking at me like 'are you for real?!'. keto = luxury. Left over will be my dinner today and possibly tomorrow too...

**Now to the SV: lost 2.2lb!! only 1lb from first goal of breaking into the 130's** 
I've only lost about 5lb in 3 weeks so this was a big drop for me! I think it's because I was always quite low carb anyway, probably about 100g a day or less, so the change wasn't too dramatic. And I'm just getting out of shark week which was slowwwww scale wise but at least I didn't gain during it. It feels SO good to see the scale nudge down a little faster.

I am really thankful that I have great support from everyone around me. My brother is also on keto so we talk about it quite a bit when we hang out. Getting my mom to understand what is carb was challenging but now she totally gets it too. My bf's family not once looked at me like a crazy person when i took out my own 'bread' at dinner. Hung out with my bf's brother and his gf and they would pick a place to eat dinner where I can order steak, without me prompting. No one around me would tell me 'just have one! you gotta try this! what's the harm?! that's not healthy!'. And my loving, adorable boyfriend... not only does he not question how our grocery bill is all egg, bacon, cream cheese, &amp; whipping cream, and puts up with the fact that our dinners are getting more expensive, but he has also handled the shamefully regular parade of ""i think I'm thinner, do you think I'm thinner? I need more water/I need a bathroom, I don't think I can eat here, I HATE the scale!!"" with such patience, humour, and good grace. I'm one happy and lucky gal. 

Thanks for listening guys!!! I hope the 130's come real soon :)

Hi there,


I've read the FAQ, used the calculator on the sidebar to calculate my macros and calorie intakes, I expected a post-induction stall. But since my first week (and 7lb loss) I've cycled through the same 3lbs, with no change in measurements.


My [side silhouette](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#0) is the only 'progress pic' I'm brave enough to show you - and the one which most clearly shows 'change'. Here the light blue is my original, the darker blue my profile at the end of month one, the pink my profile at the end of month 2. As you can see there's been almost no change in the last month.

There is also this [summary](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#4) of weight loss and measurements &gt;_&gt;

I can only conclude I've been doing something wrong...

*Because I'm not sure how big these images will display, feel free to download the album by clicking on the blue link on the mid right of the imgur album page - I was going to paste you a link but I can't get the address unfortunately sorry!!*

-----


I know you can't really help me unless you know what I've been eating - so as a visual summary (each axis equal with time):

* [Average Macros](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#3)

* [Weight with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#5) - (with the bump in the middle being shark week ofcourse)

* [Calories with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#6) - I altered my goals (dotted lines) for these when when I lost the weight and at the end of the first week and again at the first month to try and aid some weight loss. 

I know that my calorie intake has varied, though I think I've always managed to keep it below my goals. 

* [Macros with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#7) - also changed these at the end of the first week and month - no help though

* [Fat/Water/Muscle % with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#8)

And for those of you who actually prefer figures...

* [Table of daily measurements](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#2)

* [Table of daily macro/calorie values/percentages](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#1). I know these vary - but I sorta assumed the higher the fat the better. 

With the macros I've been good with my carbs except for two moments where I ate out and thought I was being good but fell foul to the demon of salad dressing &gt;_&gt;But on those cases i've checked my keto state the day after and so I know I've never been out of ketosis.

-----

Also, for the sake of honesty I've been slack with the exercise - and so I expected *slower* weight loss - but not **no** weight loss. That's why I'm of the feeling I have been doing something *wrong*.

In a little over a month I have gone down to 267.5 lbs and 44.5 inches. I won't say that it has been easy, but it's definitely been rewarding. I was kind of skeptical at first, but I'm definitely a believer now. I honestly don't even look at my weight that much. I look at how my clothes fit. There's been a few shirts that I had purchased in the past that didn't fit as well as they could. After starting Keto though I have noticed a lot of things fitting better. I also feel more energized and have a will to actually continue this. I've tried so many diets before and I end up just quitting after a week because I get upset with myself. In the first week, I lost about 6lbs and could already notice small changes. I think the most rewarding thing is my family noticing. I've always been a bigger person, but in high school I was pretty active. I don't even want to think of how much weight I actually gained once I hit college. But you know, it doesn't matter anymore. I finally found something that I feel that I can stick to...It totally doesn't mean that I won't cheat sometimes...(I just love beer) but anyways, to anyone who is thinking about starting Keto, I suggest go for it. Don't do it for anyone else but yourself though. I mean, I personally can't wait to see a bunch of people that used to think I was lesser than them because I wasn't a stick and show them that I am worth something. Even though that sounds lame, but seriously. Also to anyone who's struggling, just keep your head up because everyone is different and you can't expect to lose weight as quick as the next person. Anyways, I wish you guys luck and keep going.

Ok, so this past Saturday, I had a huge national exam for my CDM certification. Thankfully, my two other classmates and myself all passed, so we went out afterwards for lunch and drinks. And then I went out for dinner with a bunch of my friends. So basically, this weekend has been one huge ""cheat day"". I did not feel bad about it though, cause I studied hard, and deserved to go out and not think about carbs and calories. It was nice being able to go out to a restaurant with everyone and not have to just order a side salad. 

But now, I have this overwhelming ick feeling, and I had it all weekend. It just amazes me how crappy I feel now, but this is how I ate and drank almost every day before I started keto. It was a real eye opener, my old lifestyle was so wrong! I am actually excited to get back on track, and get all my energy back.

Then some crap happened, I had to go back home to help my mom out for a couple weeks. I hadn't seen her in years, and knew I was going to eat ALL THE AMAZING THINGS she cooked, so I told myself ""okay, I'll go back on the diet afterward.""

Fast forward. I get home, barely gained any weight back (~236 or so, much of that likely water retention). Take a couple days to eat my favorite foods before going back on keto. Sort of halfheartedly try to go back to keto, but I miss all the things I won't tempt everyone with by talking about way too much. Give in to a different craving every day. Finally convince myself ""well, as long as I control my calories, I'll still lose weight.""

I do pretty well for a couple weeks, getting back down to 230 on a fully shit diet with a calorie deficit (we're talking, like, putting my fast food combo meals into MFP to make sure I didn't go overboard).

Then a pound creeps up. Then a half pound. Then another. And another. I didn't get it. I hadn't changed anything. I get up to 233 and flip my shit. FINE BODY I'M GOING BACK TO KETO STOP IT ALREADY OKAY JEEZ.

After two days, the ~5 pounds of water retention you always tend to lose when you start keto came off, **as well as the 3 pounds of water bloat that turned out to be unexpected PMS-bloat.** Seriously, one day the scale said 233, then next it said 225. I thought the thing was broken until, suddenly, shark week and sudden realization.

I was chugging water constantly and still dehydrated as hell that day. Ha!

I am also on birth control. I was off of it for about of month and recently, so I wasn't on it when I started Keto, however this past Sunday the 9th, I started it up again. I'm on NuvaRing. I'm also on a very low dosage of antidepressants.

Any advice? I'm thinking it may have something to do with NuvaRing. My boyfriend wants me to see a doctor about this and figure out what's going on. I am very, very frustrated right now, sitting in a pair of at home shorts that once were loose and back to being tight.

i've always felt embarrassed and self-conscious in strapless bras because of the rampant backfat/slicing that resulted. then last week i decided to try one of my strapless bras on for the hell of it, and it actually FIT. i feel better about myself every day.

some background.. at the end of 2009 i was super depressed and at my heaviest, about 199lbs which was SCARY to see at the doctor's office. i started atkins in january 2010 and got down to the low-mid 170s by the beginning of 2011 and have plateaued there ever since, i think i was just eating too much protein. keto has helped me bust through that, and i intend on keeping this lifestyle through the foreseeable future. i'd like to get down to the 130s-140s, but for now i'm just focusing on how i feel and how i look rather than the number.

Then came a week's vacation. My husband and I did a road trip with friends to Las Vegas, driving from the Seattle area (roughly 18 hours in the car). The first couple of days I did my best to stay strong, but people kept telling me, ""you're on vacation, screw the diet"". I wavered and caved in, and ate all the things I'd been denying myself for the past 10 months.

I kept babyweight from my last pregnancy for almost two years. I vowed I wouldn't wait that long this time. I've been eating 'healthy' previously, but stumbled onto r/Keto and decided I must try this. I was tired of working so hard and not getting anywhere. Plus it felt so easy to undo all my hard work with a binge day. The 'healthy' eating was bringing on the binges as well.

Keto: I wasn't too worried about dropping carbs, because most of my meals (when I was on track) were void of the most carby items. I was able to eat LCHF on Sunday on my own easily until I started my Monday with Caveman Keto's meal plan. I managed to make up the 'during the week' meals, but by the time the weekend came I was ready to make things up as I went along.

I did drink broth my first day - but didn't experience anything I would call the keto-flu. I did discover bullet-proof coffee/tea and fatbombs this week. These were neccesary when I found myself just HUNGRY about 2 hours after eating. During the week I was just not going to hack it with only the food that was laid out on the food plan. But it got better. By the end of the week I was much less hungry. 

My weekend has been a little odd because I have gotten a killer sore throat/sinus pain thing going on right now. I don't blame keto - I blame my husband for getting it first and giving it to me. I usually eat thru sore throat pain, but haven't felt the need to stuff my face. Lots of broth. A little worried about getting all my water in, because plain water kind of 'burns' my throat right now. 

I have lost almost 5 pounds this week. I'm dipping into numbers I haven't seen in awhile and it's very motivating. I can pull some of my pants off without unbuttoning them!

Pros: 
I am not at all tempted to 'cheat' and have easily passed up carby items and treats that are around the house for the kids/husband. 
Husband likes the diet as well - cuz he gets some yummy foods (He's sweet enough to live on whatever I make him, so he's had a lot of diet dinners.)
I'm pretty sure my hunger is zapped right now - but hard to tell with the sore throat/sinus pain.

I've been doing keto for about two months now and have lost 15 lbs. It's been hard, especially dealing with the random fluctuations. I'm 5' 4"",  My starting weight was 199- my current weight is 183.6. Well, that's a lie because I've gone up two or three lbs in a couple of days. It's really discouraging.

I guess I just want to get your opinion. I can follow Keto really strictly- less than 20g of carbs a day, but I feel like I lose faster if I'm eating less than 30. I can't decide, honestly.

my clothes are slightly tighter, the scale is slightly higher, I didn't lose as much, I ate half a gram too much of X, Y, Z, my inches are less, but the scale is higher, the scale is higher but the inches are less.  What do I do?

I am hoping someone can shed some light here for me.  

I have been doing keto for roughly 4 weeks straight.  Had done it before (about 3 weeks) and fell off the wagon, got back on, blah blah blah.  Anyways, I have a history of major depression as well as a general anxiety disorder.  I've been off of medication (under a doctor's supervision) for over 5 years and was feeling great.  I lost over 50 lbs after I found out I was gluten intolerant and by following Weight Watcher's points system.

Terribly depressed and anxious - not every day, but 2 or 3 days out of a week and it's not improving.  If anything, it's getting worse.  I am incredibly close to just going back to Weight Watcher's, adding back in carbs and seeing if that helps.  This is my last ditch effort to stay on Keto because, as I mentioned, it is what my husband is doing and I want to be supportive and frankly, it's easier.  However, I can't go on like this.  I should mention that I am perimenopausal and am hyperthyroid.  Just had my labs done and those numbers are all good, so it's not that but I wanted to see if other ladies are experiencing this same effects.  I'm reluctant to just start up with Weight Watcher's since I've put this time into Keto and am just hoping that things will level out.

BEST CHOCOLATE SNACKER EVER! 

Recipe as follows, 

3/4 cup coconut oil

4 squares of 80-90 percent chocolate, or 1 square bakers unsweetened chocolate 

1 stick of butter, unsalted(1/4 lb)

5 TBSP peanut butter, I used simply jif

5-6 tps sucralose(Splenda) or what ever 
you prefer

Melt everything together. Pour into a 12 muffin pan, I sprayed mine with pan spray first just incase it stuck. Freeze for about 30 minutes or until set. Pop out and put in a ziplock bag and keep in your freezer. I entered the recipe on myfitnesspal as one piece is two servings. So 24 per recipe, 

Per serving, half a disc
Calories: 122.8
Fat: 13.8
Carbs: 1.5
Protein: 1

Two things, 1. I never post recipes! Ever. They are that good. And 2. I don't  care for the fake sugar taste/aftertaste but these are so freaking good! 

If you need a sweet bite, do it!! It took me 5 minutes to make. The hardest part was waiting for them to freeze!!

I ended up eating ramen noodles, bad on so many levels, and then pound cake. I feel like garbage, in my tummy and in my head. I don't feel like I can do this, I feel like there is no point. I have been fat forever, been on so many diets...you see where I am going? This nasty talk is really getting to me and I'm not sure how to stop listening. I am pretty sure that there is a fit, healthy woman inside me who would really like to live her life but I don't know how to get her out. I don't know how to listen to her and not to this ramen eating shame monster.

While this *was* quite a compliment, I was a little thrown off. 

Background: I'll make this short and simple as possible. In high school, I was that skinny pretty blonde girl but never realized my own beauty. I thought I was ugly, so I always tried my best to look good and impress others. Apparently, it worked. Going to college, I met new people who had no judgements about me. Overtime I just stopped ""caring"" about myself. I gained 50 pounds, and suddenly no one treated me the same anymore. Fast forward two years later...

In March after a year of failed attempts to lose weight, I started Keto and have lost a significant amount of weight. yay! my size 7 jeans fit again, when five weeks ago an 11 was tight. It's a great feeling. I haven't weighed myself since April 1st (no weigh till may) so I'm not exactly sure how much I have lost (probably 15 pounds?). 

But I am no where near the 130 pound stick I once was. And I don't want to be *that girl* again.

What I'm trying to get at is that our weight shouldn't define us. Being *attractive* is a plus, but that won't change who we are. And I think a lot of us, and others, forget that. I was beautiful at 180 pounds, but no one ever thought to tell me. I was judged based on my weight by peers, family and employers, not who I was on the inside.

I started running when I moved down south but I have a lot of difficulty in my hips (either snap-hip or arthritis) and my body started shutting down. Recently I switched over to lifting, which I LOVE. I was feeling good and making gains, but I wasn't losing fat. I'm not really complaining, as that wasn't my goal, but now I feel like I need to start losing again because my clothes aren't fitting (not just in the thighs) and I'm too poor to replace them. So I've been doing some cardio (either running or elliptical) after lifting and reducing my calorie intake. I've seen no progress. No body comp changes, no weight changes but a slight loss in lifting.

When I was making breakfast this morning, I realized I really needed to change. I get down about myself because I feel like a failure. I want to have a body that I really love and take care of. After reading up on keto, I think I need to give it a go. I realize that the first few weeks are a bummer, so I'm mentally preparing for that.

* Do you cycle carbs? As in, some people take 1.5 days off/week.

When I graduated high school, I was a whopping 210lbs. It took me a few years to get sick of being fat and try to lose weight. But, that moment came when I got married and saw my wedding pictures. Good lord, I looked horrible. I hadn't realized how heavy I looked.

Anyway, I lost 50lbs over the course of a year by doing it the wrong way and basically starving myself, getting down to 160lbs. Then, over the next 2.5 years, I gained 15, putting me at 175 when I became pregnant with my lovely daughter.

Then, good god, I let myself go. My final weight 6 weeks postpartum was the heaviest I've ever been in my life, 215lbs.

I picked back up on my starvation diet I did before and got down to 195 before it stalled out so hard, and effected my milk supply to such an extent that I couldn't do it anymore if I wanted to breastfeed.

Well, months went by and I wanted to get back on track and lose weight. I knew I couldn't starve myself. It isn't healthy and it doesn't work in the long term, so I started looking around for different things to do.

That's when I found keto! I started, and it has been, by far, the easiest thing I've done to lose weight. I feel healthy, I feel full, and I'm getting results!

This morning, I weighed myself at 185.4! And while my ultimate goal is 130 (30 pounds less than I've ever weighed as an adult), my goals along the way are: 175 (pre-baby) by my daughter's first birthday, 160 (lowest adult weight so far), and finally 130!

My strategy to counter this is: 

* find a therapist for my eating disorder

* stay busy, going out with friends and such

* avoid alcohol if possible (I shouldn't be drinking anyway)

* sleep more

I suspected at the beginning that Keto might help me since it can drop estrogen levels and mine are too high which makes problems worse. Keto has improved my pain and I have had less blood loss this month. 

If I put bad periods on a number scale, mine are usually at a 7-8 with debilitating cramps, clotting, diarrhea, painful urination (the endometriosis is in a lot of places it shouldn't be) and heavy blood loss.  Right now my period is at a 4!  

I saw a study of young women on a Keto diet where 45% were documented as reporting changes to their menstrual cycle and I have a theory about what is going on.  Women who have low estrogen might see more problems on Keto while women with high estrogen might see improvement of symptoms.  This could be why our Shark Week experiences are all over the map.  

TL,DR:  I suspect estrogen levels at beginning of diet will determine how the diet will effect women with period problems.

Been on keto since mid December. Happy with progress although I do think I am in a little plateau (possibly menstrual related). I've always been in the overweight category but I only crossed over to obese after I fell seriously ill in 2008 (lyme disease not diagnosed until almost 2 years had passed.) I was able to loose some weight I 2010 and get back to just overweight, but the pounds came back immediately and brought some friends. 

I've been measuring progress via measurements (versus scale), mainly because I have known in my heart that I would not be able to handle the truth about how bad it's gotten. Seeing some recent candid shots made me realize how bad it's recently gotten (I am a 5'4"" female and looking at pictures I'm guessing I'm about 20 lbs over my previoud high of 195.

About 40-50 of that would have come on in last year. Last time I've had such rapid gain was when I first fell ill. I suppose a benefit of keto is that it's helped me realize how poorly I've been feeling during that time. My greatest fear has been that I would get sick again, and I think I have been in denial about how that might be what is going on.

I'm realizing that I am not only really fat (like a news crew might film me walking around from thw neck down to illustrate a story on the obesity epidemic kind of fat) but possibly really sick again. It's motivated me to make lots of doctor's appointments (had a basic blood draw results pending though I won't get results for at least a couple of weeks because I am out of country for 2 weeks starting tomorrow) but also I feel really afraid.

I guess I am just feeling truly overwhelmed right now: I have a lot to weight to lose, and I think I might be looking at some bigger problems. I know what I will do -- keep calm and kero on -- but I would love to hear some encouraging words right now.

I came here to say that my plateau finally broke! I took everyone's advice and stopped stressing, stopped checking my weight every day, and drank a ton more water. I'm only at 6-8 glasses a day currently, but sometimes that is all I can stand, so we'll see if I can get past that.

I have been on Keto for a month now. :) I have had two cheat days: one where I just really wanted a gosh darn cheesy calzone (and boy was it delicious) and the second was when I had GERD (I thought I was dying!!) and the doctor at the clinic told me to eat bread and stuff that I can't eat on this diet, so I went to McDonalds (good choice, right?...) had some fries, nuggets, and a burger. The fries, although cooked perfectly, tasted gross, and the bread on the burger? Soggy. The nuggets I barely got through. Ech. 

Anyway! I'm 148.2 as of this morning!! I am SO happy! Last year it took me MONTHS, MONTHS I TELL YOU, to get to this point. This year? One freakin' month! I hope to drop another ten pounds by December and to be able to dead lift 185lbs and squat 130lbs with other weight lifting goals in mind. 

I have officially cut out all fake sugar as well. I can have a coke zero every now and then, but Splenda? Nope. The doctor told me my GERD was probably a cause of the fake sugar (I thought I was having a heart attack, no joke!). And sure enough! If I have a low-carb ice cream, my stomach gets mad at me and starts hurting like hell. If I make my own frozen yogurt (SO GOOD), it hurts. So I'm cutting it out. I could try other fake sugars, but I figured it would be better for my stomach, and my pocket book, to not try. I will enjoy a coke zero every now and then, though, don't get me wrong.

Shark week is next week. We shall see what challenges lie ahead with that!

**Short version: appetite has dropped off a lot, shark week was a much calmer, my energy has increased 100 fold, weight loss has not-unexpectedly been minimal (reasons given), and I’m still fighting on forcing enough fat into my diet after years of fat-phobia indoctrination. Lovin’ life, keto on!**

I’ll do the bullet list here in a second, but I want to say first off that I feel like an entirely new person, now that the keto-flu has finally dissipated. All those stories are TRUE! It’s like a fog has lifted from body and mind. I feel mentally sharper, more awake, stronger, and more resilient. I’ve taken to dancing for about 30 minutes every day (my 43 year old white woman moves, they are blinding!!!) just because I have so much energy to burn in the evenings that I want to get up and do something. (It’s less a workout than playtime, but I still work up a sweat and I love it.) I’m waking up *awake* which is also highly unusual for me. Even if I never lose a pound I don’t think I would change back to my old eating habits. This is just too good. 

For all the nitty gritty details:

~ Most significantly, my appetite has dropped off, as in “dropped off a cliff.” My body is hungry in the mornings and I find I eat most of my calories during breakfast and lunch; when I get home, the most I have for “dinner” is a snack, because I’m just not hungry for a full meal. Still, when I say “eat most of my calories” I mean, basically, a low-carb protein shake made with coconut milk, bulletproof coffee, a fat bomb, and one small lunch of either a slice of egg casserole a bowl of hamburger scramble w/ cream cheese. I will sometimes stuff a boiled egg or a fat bomb in right before I leave work at 5pm for the walk to the bus station, but sometimes even that is just too much to contemplate. I get home, snack on a few slices of bacon or cheese, or my fave pepperoni slices with cream cheese, make a dessert out of a fat bomb, and that’s it. I’m full ALL THE TIME. One reason this is so crucial for me is that, after years of training (aka psychological torture) via low-calorie/starvation diets, I now panic when I get hungry. *Not being hungry* is absolutely a critical component of any food paradigm I choose to live by, and whoa, does keto do that beautifully! Thank you, keto! :D

~ My period was different. Mind you, I have a (non-hormone) IUD, which changed my period significantly when it was implanted four years ago, and not for the better. Ugh. So when I say “my period was different” what I’m really saying is that it was more like the periods I used to have before the IUD: short, medium flow, low-to-no cramps. It was a welcome change, believe you me!

~ My energy has increased, and my recovery time from physical exertion is shorter. I wrote about that in my post about helping a friend move, and I’ve seen it in other parts of my life. I just *feel* like being more active; for instance, I’ll walk to work from the downtown bus plaza, rather than wait 10 minutes for the connecting bus, just because I feel like walking instead of sitting (I get to work at the same time regardless).  And as I wrote above, I get the urge to dance when I get home after work, whereas before I could barely peel myself up from where ever I landed when I walked through the door. This is HUGE, I have to say. It also supports something that nearly knocked me flat when I read it in one of Taubes’ books (and I paraphrase): “Maybe marathon runners aren’t thin because they run, but run because they are thin.” I *get that* now. I really get it. Wow. Game changer for me!

~ Also as I referenced above, my mental acuity has suddenly up-ticked over the last couple of days. Dare I say the lingering keto-flu is finally lifting for good? The last week has been a case of off/on for keto-flu symptoms, as I wrote in my week 3 recap, but suddenly I’m feeling a lot sharper and more mentally energetic, to go along with the increased physical energy. 

~ Disappointingly but unsurprisingly, weight loss has been minimal. I’m still wearing my size 18 pants, and while they are looser (and I can, actually, get my size 16 jeans up over my hips where I couldn’t do that before) they fit. I say “unsurprisingly” for a couple of reasons: one, I’m not counting calories or carbs, and while I am good at “eyeballing” I’m sure I come over/under occasionally; two, I’m using splenda in my fat bombs, of which I have two or three a day – I’d rather use something else, but stevia has an aftertaste for me and aspartame tastes even nastier IMHO – so that might be affecting insulin, and **I’m open to suggestions that aren’t sucralose, stevia or aspartame**; three, my body is 43 years old and has been doing the low-calorie-diet tango for, literally, 30 years so I know my metabolism is just one hot mess and might take more than a month to really adapt to ketosis…I mean, my keto-flu lasted nearly a month, so yeah, slow going ahead. That said, I know I’ve been in ketosis every day, not just from what the ketostix say but other indicators such as (TMI alert) bad/metal breath and oily urine. So, while I wish the weight was melting off (I really, really want to be back into my size 16 jeans at least!), it’s not. 

~ My biggest hurdle has been upping my fat content, hence resorting to fat bombs and avocados. I’m SO indoctrinated with “fat is bad!” mentality that I find myself cutting back on butter &amp; cream cheese in recipes out of instinct. Yes, I know. I KNOW! But it’s weird, okay? It just is. :P 

Finally, an FYI: My version of keto is what I have come to learn is called the HFLC Protocol (or sumsuch): High Fat, Low Carb. This particular version cuts out grains, starches, and sugar while pushing a high (at least 60%) fat intake without calorie counting. Since counting/tracking *anything* is a mild ED for me, one that can get out of hand quickly, this is the best version for me mental-health wise, even if weight loss will take longer. Trade offs, I make them!

However, after trying a lot of good recipes, eating good food, I've just mentally burned out.

But this doesnt mean I want to quit keto. I want to continue, but I was wondering if anyone else has just gotten to a point where they feel very ""meh"" about the whole keto thing. Could just be my period talking (which never happens to me) too. I planned on going on a trip this weekend with no choice but to eat some non-keto stuff and I was mentally prepared to do it and then return (Ive broke keto once for 2 days and returned without a problem) but then the trip was cancelled and now Im feeling down about not being able to break keto. 



Any advice from the people who have been ketoing longer?


Update: Decided to break keto and had some things to mix it up. Was worth it to me. Im always afraid I'll end up being one of those people that cant control themselves and will eat everything in sight. But I ate a bit got full now I'm moving on with my life.

It's great for info but sucks for support. 

I put my horrifying stats in my flair for all to see. I've lost copious amounts of weight twice in the past. Once, from doing a super low fat diet, and once from eating 1200-1400 calories a day. The second time I lost weight was basically to get pregnant. I am without a Shark Week when I am this heavy, resulting in infertility. So I had a baby a little over 3 years ago and afterwards, packed the weight back on. In the 3 years after having my son, I managed to gain 72 lbs. And that doesn't include the weight I gained when I was pregnant... because I had lost all of that weight by about 6 weeks PP. So yeah, not my best 3 years weight-wise for sure. But I am back at it and my husband discovered keto and for the sake of convenience (not cooking multiple meals), I decided to try it with him. I am on day 6 and have lost 7 lbs. In the 2 or 3 months prior to starting keto, I was doing more calorie counting and juicing and that is where I lost the initial 12 lbs. 

The last 6 days have not been entirely easy. I'm always thirsty and my sugar cravings are rampant. Oh, what I would do for some chocolate or ice cream. And I am still trying to adjust to keep my calories within the range I need them to be. I know a lot of people who aren't familiar with this way of eating, think that it's all about unlimited bacon and butter but it's really not. So that's been challenging. I haven't experienced any keto flu symptoms, however I have been slightly irritable. I chalk it up to a lack of seratonin in my brain due to no carbs. And I think the BIGGEST struggle is having a 3 year old who loves carbs. I don't feel comfortable taking his carbs away since he's so young and healthy, but having things like cereal and crackers and fruit in the house is really tough. Any moms out there can probably relate, but there have been numerous times in the last 6 days where I have had to stop myself from not just tossing a piece of cereal or Goldfish cracker in my mouth, out of sheer habit. 

I will stop rambling now. I just wanted to introduce myself and say hi, since I plan to post here quite a bit from now on. :)

Sometimes my will power is the problem and I just cant control myself wanting the carbs that my family is eating, but a majority of the time it is that I am just too tired to make a separate meal for myself.

So he thinks that just doing his job is going to make him drop weight and that even I dont really need to diet, just need to be more active.

I have been considering just emptying my kitchen of all the massive carbs and forcing everyone in my home to eat the way I want to eat (in essence, eat healthier) but I dont know how good that will be for my 4 young (under the age of 7) children and my stubborn redheaded husband.

There seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether calories count or not when living low-carb (and when they might count), so I'm going to leave that one alone.

What I am going to ask is something I can't seem to find either by searching Reddit or the Internet in general. Let's assume that regardless of low-carbing, calories *do* count. If so, I see no incentive to low-carb at all, unless there are some specific benefits of lowering calorie count *and* carb count at the same time. To me, that would suggest that the low-carb naysayers are right: that all low-carbing accomplishes is lowering your caloric intake, so you might as well not give up carbs if they matter to you.

So, to the lovely ladies here who are pro counting both of the aforementioned macros, what makes lowering both better than just, say, counting calories and upping fat/protein intake without restricting carbs so heavily?

Today was day 3.  The first day I failed hardcore on the carbs number I was at 45 while really trying. Yesterday was better with 17 grams of carbs. Does Dietary fiber do anything for this number? (I had 6 grams)
today I had 18 grams of carbs and 7 dietary fiber. I find it really hard to get up to my calorie goal of 1200 without all the carbs I was eating.  
Is there any fruit we can eat, or is all pretty much off limits?
I picked up some keto sticks and I am the one right before the darkest color.  I don't really know what this means, but I think it is a good thing. 
Any tips from those that have been doing this a while would be great.

My goal weight is 135-140 and I'm 5'7. 

When I first started Keto I lost weight like crazy, which well, motivated me a lot. I want that motivation back. I wrote all my foods down, so I was tracking my calories and was really strict with my carb count. I was working out a lot more often too. This is what I want to do again. However, I'm really struggling getting back into it. 

So ladies, if you can please share some tricks of the trade and things that you find helpful that motivate you, I'd really appreciate it. Feel free to share anything that you think would be helpful. 

Things I've done so far:

I've kept a progress power-point presentation that is mainly for me and to track progress pictures and what not

I was keeping track of my weight and measurements using excel

I have this drawing, it looks like a thermometer that I'd color in when I'd reach another ten pounds lost. 

I plan on doing all that again and I have been using the Atkins.com site too, since it is free and helpful. However, I want more and new ideas to keep me going :)

So my hurdles aren't motivation or forgiving myself and ketoing on. 

They're pretty simple actually: money, skills, and time. 

I am already pretty close to the poverty line and I'm about to sink even closer to it as I take a cut in hours so I can continue my degree. I'm very short on money and the fact is that carbs are cheaper and easier than what's required of ketoing. Also, keto foods usually require more prep and as I've learned in trying to do keto on and off for a couple months is that I really suck at cooking. Not only that but it makes me so anxious there are meals I skip entirely because the thought of cooking just sends me into an anxiety attack. And even though I'm taking a cut in hours I'm about to be starting classes soon so I'll be low on time too. 

I've been trying to untangle all these factors for a while now and I'm having a lot of trouble. 

I have a few ideas:

I think making a bunch of meals ahead of time and freezing them would work really well so that way I only have to really cook once every week or every two weeks. Also that would help with time too. 

I'm thinking about using some of my birthday money to get a decent protein shake (one of those big bags). That would help for those times when I don't have anything on hand and the thought of cooking a full meal is too much. 

The biggest problem is money. I really don't want to spend more than 150 a month (cat food and cleaning stuff included) per month. Bonus points if I could get it under 100. 

So -- any thoughts, resources, or experiences?

I've also been doing week-long meals for lunch and dinner, because the worst part of dieting for me is having to cook every night.

I've been doing keto for just over a month to try to get back to my previous weight/size from a few years ago.  I have about 25 pounds I'd like to lose, but I've been struggling so hard and can't seem to find any way that works for me.  I haven't stepped on the scale yet this month, but at the boot camp I go to my weigh in is next week and I'm kind of nervous.  

A little background:
Over the last few years I gained 25-30 pounds that I just haven't been able to get rid of.  I had to donate all of my old clothes because none of them fit anymore, and I spend a lot of days off wearing sweatpants now. Since the end of December I've been on a typical low calorie/lots of exercise type diet, using MFP to track my food.(I try this every so often and don't seem to lose anything, so I decided to exercise more this time, thinking that might be the key.)  I didn't lose one single pound during that time.  In fact, I gained two, and hoped it was muscle, but the body fat analyzer at the gym I go to said I gained a percentage of body fat.  (How accurate are those hand held analyzers, anyway?)  Since I've been eating keto style, I've noticed all of my clothes are becoming MUCH baggier, I need belts to hold my pants up when I didn't need them before, and my husband even commented this morning that I was looking a little smaller.  I suppose I shouldn't be nervous to get weighed in next week, but I can't seem to help it! haha.

A few NSV's I've noticed....(besides the pants getting too big) are that my stomach has completely calmed down.  I have IBS-D, and I haven't had one single problem once I started feeling this way.  No bloating, no horrible urges to run to the restroom immediately, no problems whatsoever, it's been so nice.  Anyone else with IBS experienced this?  Another thing I've noticed is that my energy is literally through the roof!  The first few weeks of this diet I was tired, cranky, could barely climb the stairs at work, and once that passed now I feel like I have energy to spare.  It's made me obsessed with jogging for some reason, I feel great when I'm out in the fresh air jogging and it seems like such a great way to spend this extra energy.  My typical exercises before starting boot camp in January were using the elliptical and sometimes the stair master, and doing the weight machines, but this feels so much better! 

So that's my story! :)

I started Keto dieting 4 days ago, my carb intake is below 20, 1400 cals a day, and I have been eating a pretty low carb Paleo diet before this. According to my Ketosis sticks, I am still not in ketosis. Hmm. I guess this will come within a week or so? I do IF by the way, and have done that for circa a year.

However, I was wondering if any of you who have PCOS and eats Keto are doing carb ups to break plateaus or for other metabolic reasons?
As PCO'ers do not tolerate carbs that well, I am not sure if I should do this, thus I am very interested to hear back from some of you :)

Thank you for all the replies. It seems like carb ups are not as good for PCOS'er as others.

I started keto last Thursday evening and have already lost some weight (even if it is water weight, the scale still moved!). I have struggled with weight most of my life. I was 160lbs in fifth grade and have never managed to get back down to that. At my heaviest I was 285. My husband and I each lost about 100lbs over two or three years the ""right"" way, but then we have both gained a lot of it back (I got down to 175, but got back up to 220). My husband found keto on here and we decided to try it. We like structure, but still being able to enjoy our food (bacon!). I was pre-diabetic before losing weight, actually on medication for it, but then when I lost, I was fine. Getting back up to 220 put me back at risk and my doctor asked me if I wanted to go back on medication or control it with diet. Guess which I chose! 

Now that the life story is out of the way, I have a question. I have seen a few posts about shark week... I have been on birth control since I was twelve to control cycles and other various reasons. Now it's ALSO so I don't get pregnant (go figure, huh?). I have the arm implant Implanon. I have gone months without my shark week. I actually don't remember my last one, it has been so long. Two days into keto and I woke up in the middle of the night... sharky? No idea how to put it delicately. Did keto induce this? I was very happy without shark week. I will, of course, deal with it if it means being healthy, but I was just wondering if this is normal.

(xpost from r/keto)",thinnerthrowaway,14,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1kczf2/anecdotal_researched_and_secondhand_professional/,"Hello! **Pre-emptive TL; DR: Here's a non-comprehensive bunch of information about how keto does not affect a fetus, and the few instances where you would actually have to worry.**

After going back on keto early in my third trimester to begin to starve off a systemic yeast overgrowth, and freaking out at sudden weight loss/very quick glycogen depletion and posting here (then deleting the post), I have done a bunch of reading and spoken to multiple actual medical professionals about pregnant keto. In the interest of helping the next person with the same questions, here's what I've found.

First of all, ketones themselves are a non-issue. They're non-teratogenic, meaning they do not contribute to birth defects of any known type. Worries about the impact of ""extra acid"" on the amniotic fluid don't hold water (ha ha), as the content and PH of that soup changes constantly depending on your mood and what you eat. Kiddo will taste the flavor of your food within 5 minutes.

Secondly, you need to really watch your calories and nutrient macros closely - if you do not eat enough protein and calcium, your body will cannibalize itself to feed the fetus. Postnatal osteoporosis isn't fun, and suddenly having pipe-cleaner arms and no thigh muscles to speak of isn't a blast either.

Thirdly, even if you are eating and eating and eating, due to the nature of how keto impacts digestion and the body's use of fuel, you will either slow your gains or lose weight depending on your own insulin sensitivity and weight at the time you begin eating low-carb. This MAY be a concern. 

In RARE cases of weight loss, especially in the third trimester, the fetus slows or stops growing (it's a protective action by the human body. Some women are simply prone to it - thier bodies favor thier own survival in favor of the fetus'. This is the opposite case of the self-cannibalization mentioned above; variety of response in a species is a good thing.). The good news is, this is very easy to spot and correct. Normal uterine measurements, routinely done, will catch it right away.

I have been advised not to be concerned about fat-soluble toxins being released due to weight loss (actual use by the body); when the fat is actually used as opposed to the system being flushed in any other way (a la detox), the content of your blood plasma changes much less and thus is not considered to be a threat to fetal development.

Lastly, regarding my own freakout re: glycogen depletion, everything is going to happen a lot faster biochemically/digestively; glucose is used up faster, and insulin is used by the fetus as well as mother, so even if you eat more carbs you will rarely experience the unpleasant side-effects from carb-loading or blood sugar spiking. Insulin is actually a growth trigger in kids and infants, which was a TIL for me. Ketosis will stunt a child's growth. Thankfully, a fetus's needs are minimal and can be addressed by just not eating for induction phase.

This is by no means complete, but it does address my own worries from 3 weeks ago. Hopefully somebody else will see it and be reassured. If anybody else has useful info, let's add it to the comments and make this a FAQ for pregnant keto-ers with knowledge of the search tool. :)",,False,,t5_2u80h,1376512436.0,,,True,t3_1kczf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1kczf2/anecdotal_researched_and_secondhand_professional/,

Warning: Long Read Ahead! (Skip to TL;DR for pics @ Bottom)

Hello fellow xxketoers!

It's my first photo Friday and I thought I would share my progress with keto so far. I was introduced to keto/low carb and this subreddit by my ex-bf/now best friend who's dabbled in it.

On examining my diet shortly before starting, I found that most of my carb intake was consisting of sugar and refined grain foods. Being vegan/vegetarian, I was getting really tired of trying to plan my nutrition and menus extensively and having to eat every few hours and was eating a very carb centric diet of whole grains, low fat recipes with vegetables and salad and occasional vegan ""passables"" such as vegan candy bars and cupcakes. The politics/other vegans were getting under my skin too and co-workers were bringing treats to the office too many times after Xmas. And when I was a teen, I ate a lot of fast food and pizza, so my diet has been slowly improving over the past few years. 

At my heaviest, I weighed close to 200 pounds a few years ago; when I was on a vegan diet, I was close to 150 pounds and getting compliments on my looks and willpower.

Since starting this ""diet"", I've noticed that:

* I've had steady energy throughout the day and love how I don't need to be eating a lot to feel full.

* Some of my clothes stared to fit better and have even gotten too big for me to wear. It's getting to the point where I've bought an even smaller bra today (band size from 36 to a 34, so I know it's working), which will be the first time in my life doing so.

* I've noticed that I've lost a lot of weight in regards to fat rather than losing fat and muscle mass. I notice that my muscles have been defined in places like in my arms,  inner thighs, and even my ribs which are tough areas for me to lose fat and have been slimming down faster with exercise.

* I feel as if I can run, walk or burn off energy in productive ways without getting winded. In some ways, I feel like I do when I was a kid again and had energy (fat) to burn. Additionally, I have an old injury in my left knee cap (unstable due to a 12 year old basketball mishap) and I've noticed that I haven't had a lot of pain in the joint since eating naturally-occurring fats. It seems to have more elasticity (the good kind) and bounce back, as if I'm not even injured. I was afraid what would happen since re-injuries were common before I lost weight being a vegetarian, but I think eating fat helps immensely. 

* I've been really good at staving off carby temptations compared with trying to adhere to a vegan diet. This might be due to me eating some ""cheat"" meals and desserts and me waking up zonked the next morning from a huge insulin crash. I guess one harsh lesson is one too many and I've also noticed (as other people do here) that most carb-rich foods don't have a lot of flavor in and of themselves, so cutting out the ""cardboard"" (so-to-speak) and replacing it was more delicious options has been easier than I thought. 

A few goals for Summer/Fall include:

* Trying to get into eating more vegetarian friendly keto meals from /r/vegetarianketo. Just because I'm not vegetarian/vegan doesn't mean I despise vegetables. In fact, I'd rather eat them than fries and love getting salads as a meal and can't wait to try cooking them in fats/butter. I will improve my cooking skills since I'm not sure how long I can last on a diet of slim jims and diet pepsi :P

* Will also try some IF to see what works best with my metabolism and work schedule and see what succeeds.

* Should track my food more closely on MFP. I do have an account, but my Android's too old to DL the app (will fix this next month when I switch carriers/get a new phone). Tracking percentage macros is much easier than having to read all ingredients to see if they're animal derived.

* Probably going to include some fitness goals in with my weight loss goals. I don't think I'll ever be the kind of gal who'll fit into size 0 jeans since I'm pretty muscular, so I'll supplement the weight/fat loss with trying to get even more fit. I've done pilates and yoga for years and have done some cardio workouts including 30DS. I'm also looking forward to signing up for kickboxing classes and playing Australian football and rugby with a few groups in the Twin Cities soon.

As far as goals are concerned, I'm currently shooting for thanksgiving as a goal date, but that does seem to be a bit far off. So for now, I want to say that I want to fit comfortably into a size 10 pair of jeans (not a 12 for jeans and dress pants) and get down to 155 pounds by the end of August. Does that goal seem feasible? I do want to see if I can even get back to the way my body was when I was vegan last Thanksgiving at 150 pounds. Being that slim was a nice place to be...

Anyway here are pics from me in April and on the Fourth of July for comparison. I'm not sure if I can spot a difference, but let me know if you do!

TL;DR: ""Diet"" is going well for this former vegan. Losing weight and feeling good. Unsure about future goals, but will keep experimenting

Also, do you count calories?  I find that I have to.  I cannot just indiscriminately eat keto foods and lose without staying in a deficit.  Now, with keto that range is a lot higher then with calorie counting (1300 vs 1700) but still...there is a line and when crossed...no weight loss.

I've encountered several posts of posters recommending to stay away from ""carb-up"" days/meals in the ""introductory phase"" of keto. I'm not necessarily looking to do CKD, but more just wondering what are some common indications of when your ""introductory phase"" is finally over?  


Is the intro phase is officially ""over"" once you start losing weight? Once you're out of the keto-flu woods?  I ask because according to my Ketostix, I'm supposedly in ketosis, but aside from my initial water-weight loss, I've not lost a single pound (heavy sigh) in a month of keto'ing.  


I love the way I feel (once the keto flu subsided - that's one week I NEVER want to relive) and how AWESOME I sleep, and I'm not tempted to go back to eating habits; I'm just wondering how long before I start seeing results on the scale?  I've seen people say 3-4 weeks, some say 3 months, some say 1 week. Any feedback on how long the intro phase lasted for you?


I know that xxketo is a bit more forgiving that r/keto, but just to give you some more background:  I track all my food on MFP, have a 1500 cal/day target calc'd using the keto calculators (although I've experiemented +/- 100 calories to see if it would make a difference). I'm currently training for a sprint triathlon and sprinkling in weight training. I Lost about 20 lbs a couple years ago following womenshealthpersonaltrainer.com exercise &amp; meal plans (albeit starving the entire time) and have regained it all.   


If I'm simply being impatient, just say so (I can handle it!) or if you have any tips, I'm all ears!

I have been attributing (most of) the stall to starting a weightlifting routine that I love around the same time in January and muscle taking over fat.  I have lost inches, my clothes fit looser and I look better.  The rest of the stall was definitely because of lacking diet discipline.  I'm in the same boat with several other xxketo'ers and have a husband that has lost 25 lbs and 7% body fat with a whole lot less discipline than I have and it's hard to have him treating himself and not join in.

I started keto for the second time last Friday. I was a bit lazy with it the first 2 days, but had a stressful relationship situation happen on Monday and I couldn't eat. I forced myself to eat Monday and tuesday, but probably got less than 1000 cals those days. I also was battling the keto flu too, which was not fun. Wednesday I was feeling a bit better, was in ketosis for sure (finally purple - trace til then) and I just wasn't hungry. I made a smoothie, I ate a salad, and a couple Cheesesticks. Thursday and Friday were a little more normal except I just don't feel hungry. I eat because I know I need to, I felt lethargic bc of the calorie deficit I think.  Is it ok to just know that I'm obviously not starving, just my body is adapting? And I know water weight is involved, I just didn't think that much. Not to mention I started shark week 3 days ago.

Anyway, weighed myself this morning, and I was down 10 pounds from last Friday. Am I not taking care of myself properly or should I just smile and be happy about it? I just don't feel very hungry.

I have always drank water, definitely not as much as I do now but still more then the average person. But now that I drink twice as much I also have to pee three times as much. That being said I have a huge phobia of public bathrooms, no matter how clean they look or are. HAHA now I have to talk myself into using them, it sucks! But I do it cause my bladder is FULL.

Another thing that I noticed was that I used to hate how I felt in my clothes but now, when I pull on a pair of jeans, especially those that used to be tight, I feel beautiful in my own skin. I have a lot more to lose but I love this feeling. I see and feel my body changing and its great.

And last but certainly not least, that I am absolutely enjoying this lifestyle change. Some days I am a little unmotivated but I carry on. Each day brings me closer to my goal and that keeps me motivated. Every time I step into that horribly hot yoga room I know that I am there to change me for me alone.

It could be because of my period which starts this weekend. Either way, I'm mostly wondering if I got the right amount of calories.

I'm 5', and around 202lbs (started Keto at 210). I try to do 20 minutes of zumba at least 3 times a week and lift 2-3 times a week (squats, lunges, deadlifts, benchpress). I've been sticking to around 1200 calories and stay under 30g of carbs with around 80-90g (60-70%) of fat and 75-85g (20-30%) of protein and drinking 3L of water.

Am I doing right? Should I add more fat? More calories?

This new lifestyle is incredible. We both have more energy, my husband says his back feels better every day (chronic back injury), and I am NEVER hungry! We've both also tried so many new foods that we now love... I'm looking at you Sugar snap peas and Brussels Sprouts!

As of this morning, I am 192lb down from 210lb one month ago, and my husband is down to 283lb from 303lb. I haven't been this thin in over two years and my husband hasn't seen this weight since 2007ish. We;ve never been happier with ourselves and cannot weight (get it, haha) to see what's to come!!!

So yes, like my title states I threw up just 5 min ago. I started trying to ease into keto yesterday (I didn't eat as many veggies as I would have liked). I noticed I started getting a slight headache but I didn't do anything for it and just went to bed. When I woke up I had a pounding migraine and did not feel good. I still prepared my bacon and hardboiled eggs but just looking at them made me feel nauseous. I took an advil migraine but could only manage to force down a slice of bacon with it. An hour later, all the water and that slice of bacon pretty much came up. I feel much better (even though the headache is still here) but now I'm unsure if keto is for me or if it was maybe taking the advil on an empty stomach (sidenote: I get headaches more than your average human and I pop advil like it's candy without consequences). Does anyone have a similar experience or any advice?

The first is more immediate, and it's been brought up so many times. The past few weeks or so I've been just ridiculously ravenous. I can't stop eating. Normally I don't even feel the need to eat until after 3pm, but now my stomach is painfully rumbling all day long. I'm gaining weight back. I have been trying do fat fasts, but the hunger is so intense that I haven't managed it yet. It's not a hormonal thing -- I wish it were, then I could just blame it on shark week! But I'm on BC that completely gets rid of my periods. I know it's probably temporary, but I feel like an abject failure because my willpower is completely gone.

The second is more philosophical. The more weight I lose, the fatter I feel. I think this has to do with my clothes not fitting me quite right anymore. I haven't lost enough for a new wardrobe or anything, but all of my favorite pieces of clothing just don't sit right anymore. I dont think they're quite too big, but things that used to flatter me perfectly now look weird. I can't afford to go tailor all of my clothes, and part of me thinks that I'll just gain everything back again anyway and shouldn't bother. I know I should start lifting weights on top of my usual ""exercise"" (which is just walking 3-5 miles/day), but I abhor working out and frankly it just makes me even more ravenous, which won't help my first problem.

I weigh 10 pounds less than I ever have in my adult life. I don't think I look any different, and most of me is excited to keep pushing on, but there is a pretty large part that is kind of terrified. I'm used to me. I'm not ""that fat."" And my confidence just keeps dropping the more I lose weight (but of course if I gain back even an ounce, it's cause for a panic attack).

For the past two years, I've been trying (mostly in vain) to lose weight that I put on when I moved to Louisiana. I have PCOS, but I've been uninsured, so I haven't been seeing a doctor regularly, and most of what I knew about PCOS came from a small amount of online research. Finally about two weeks ago, I stumbled on /r/PCOS, and /r/xxketo was mentioned there. I realized that, even though I knew PCOS caused insulin resistance, I hadn't been taking that into consideration when dieting. To give some context, I have tried everything from biking an hour a day, to eating a strict vegan diet (which was the most successful, and I realize now that probably had a lot to do with cutting out things like pasta since it contains eggs). 

I'm also going to be getting back on my dad's insurance when his policy renewal comes up in October, which means I can go back to a gynecologist, and possibly see an endocrinologist as well.

I bled heavily for 12 days straight, the worst kind heavy flow and hourly large clots.  

The first Dr. I went to did a full workup to make sure I wasn't have a miscarriage.  However, when all was clear she said I would have to either have the Implanon removed or wait for the bleeding to stop.  

The bleeding continued for 4 more days so I went to an OBGYN that performs Implanon removals and instead of removing it she gave me a pack of regular old birth control pills to take.  The bleeding stopped 2 hours after I took 1 pill.  She said the diet may have caused my hormones to go crazy, but didn't say I should stop!  She gave me more pills just in case it happens again and I got to keep my Implanon. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to share this in case any of you are on Implanon and experience the same thing.

7:00 - roast beef and avocado/salad veggies

Added all together with portion sizes, this coms to over 1600 calories and that is *OK* but really I want to eat 1500 or under and at this amount I don't know what I can cut or do different because I am still HUNGRY!

Any help?  Will I get used to it?  Should I drink more water?  Sometimes water can make me hungrier.

Despite my failure to stick with keto for very long I have lost 10 pounds and I'm ready to be held accountable so here I am announcing to the kind ladies at xxketo that I am beginning my journey and I know I can do this! It's really inspiring to read all your posts and see the support you provide each other. I know that getting past the cravings is really about staying strong and willpower and all that, but if you ladies have any advice for me I would greatly appreciate it. How many of you have had the same start and stop experience as I have? For those of you who powered through, how long did it take for the cravings to subside?

I've been threatening to start keto for months now and finally realizing that it's time to try it out. My birthday is in two weeks and I'd love to fit back into some old clothes for the big 2-5.

About two years ago, I got down to my all-time lowest weight of 128 in a really unhealthy way. I maintained at about 130 for a long time, but have recently started taking a medication that caused my weight to jump up to 150 within a couple of months. 

I work A LOT and legitimately don't have much time for the gym anymore...any home workouts you guys like on DVD or YouTube? I'm really into Pilates and Yoga incorporated into workouts. 

I'd love some friends on MFP and any helpful encouragement you might have for starting out. Any advice on setting macros for keto in MFP?

MFP: anp3g

I'm looking forward to going on this journey with you all!

1375889478.0,10,self.xxketo,1jvzkc,Has anybody had any negative effects with IF?,Jennynot,11,1,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1jvzkc/has_anybody_had_any_negative_effects_with_if/,"Hi there, I've heard good things on this subreddit (and /r/keto, /r/rfitness etc) about IF helping with weight loss. I was considering incorporating it into my routine but serendipitously an email arrived in my inbox today which linked to [these](http://www.paleoforwomen.com/shattering-the-myth-of-fasting-for-women-a-review-of-female-specific-responses-to-fasting-in-the-literature/) [two](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/women-and-intermittent-fasting/#axzz2aeEOMKxC) well-researched interesting articles which suggest that fasting (including 24 hour and IF) may not be very goof for women at all.

-------------------

For example

* Fasting has different endocrine effects on male and female rats.

*In male rats*:

No matter the duration or degree of nutritional stress, male rat brain chemistry responds with similar changes. Nocturnal activity and cognition stay fairly stable, regardless of the intensity of the fast. If you push the fast long enough, males will get a little wonky and frantic, but overall they maintain pretty well. It’s like they’re equipped with the ability to handle nutritional stressors.

*In female rats*:

Any degree of nutritional stress (fasting or mere caloric restriction) causes increased wakefulness (during the day, when they normally sleep), better cognition (for finding food), hyper alertness, and more energy. In short, female rats become better at finding and acquiring food when they fast, as if their bodies aren’t as well-equipped to deal with the stress of going without food. They also become less fertile, while the males actually become hornier and more fertile (probably to account for the females’ plummeting fertility). Ovary size drops (bad for fertility), adrenal gland size increases (which in rats indicates exposure to chronic stress), and menstrual cycles begin to dysregulate in proportion to the degree of caloric restriction.

* And the few human studies performed: One study, which I’ve cited before as evidence of a benefit to fasting, found that while IF improved insulin sensitivity in male subjects, female subjects saw no such improvement. In fact, the glucose tolerance of fasting women actually worsened.

* Later, both obese men and women dropped body fat, body weight, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyercides on a fasting regimen. These people were obese, however, and perimenopausal women were excluded from the study, so the results may not apply to leaner people or women of reproductive age.

* but Mark's Daily Apple article theorises: ""*In fact, I suspect that if an IF study was performed on sugar-burning women versus fat-adapted women, you’d see that the fat-burning beasts would perform better and suffer fewer (if any) maladaptations.*""

----------

So, this is pretty interesting and I was wondering what people did here, and whether they experienced any negative side-effects, how they felt it worked (or didn't) etc
