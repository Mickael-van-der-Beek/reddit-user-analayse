1366465095.0,887,self.Parenting,1cqncb,I read all the major books on baby sleep. Here is what I learned. (xpost beyondthebump),,1115,228,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1cqncb/i_read_all_the_major_books_on_baby_sleep_here_is/,"A friend of mine, Ava Neyer, who is a fellow twin mom, posted this to a facebook baby group and I had to share:

I went on amazon and bought all the top books on baby sleep and development. I read through them all, as well as several blogs and sleep websites. I gathered lots of advice. 

You shouldn’t sleep train at all, before a year, before 6 months, or before 4 months, but if you wait too late, your baby will never be able to sleep without you. College-aged children never need to be nursed, rocked, helped to sleep, so don’t worry about any bad habits. Nursing, rocking, singing, swaddling, etc to sleep are all bad habits and should be stopped immediately. White noise will help them fall asleep. White noise, heartbeart sounds, etc, don’t work. Naps should only be taken in the bed, never in a swing, carseat, stroller, or when worn. Letting them sleep in the carseat or swing will damage their skulls. If your baby has trouble falling asleep in the bed, put them in a swing, carseat, stroller, or wear them. 

Put the baby in a nursery, bed in your room, in your bed. Cosleeping is the best way to get sleep, except that it can kill your baby, so never, ever do it. If your baby doesn't die, you will need to bedshare until college.  

Use the same cues as night: cut lights, keep the house quiet and still. Differentiate naps from nightly sleep by leaving the lights on and making a regular amount of noise. Keep the room warm, but not too warm. Swaddle the baby tightly, but not too tightly. Put them on their back to sleep, but don't let them be on their backs too long or they will be developmentally delayed. Give them a pacifier to reduce SIDS. Be careful about pacifiers because they can cause nursing problems and stop your baby from sleeping soundly. If your baby sleeps too soundly, they’ll die of SIDS.  

Don’t let your baby sleep too long, except when they’ve been napping too much, then you should wake them. Never wake a sleeping baby. Any baby problem can be solved by putting them to bed earlier, even if they are waking up too early. If your baby wakes up too early, put them to bed later or cut out a nap. Don’t let them nap after 5 pm. Sleep begets sleep, so try to get your child to sleep as much as possible. Put the baby to bed awake but drowsy. Don't wake the baby if it fell asleep while nursing. 

You should start a routine and keep track of everything. Not just when they sleep and how long, but how long it has been between sleep, how many naps they’ve had per day, and what you were doing before they slept. Have a set time per day that you put them to bed. Don’t watch the clock. Put them on a schedule. Scheduling will make your life impossible because they will constantly be thrown off of it and you will become a prisoner in your home. 

Using CIO will make them think they’ve been abandoned and will be eaten by a lion shortly. It also causes brain damage. Not getting enough sleep will cause behavior and mental problems, so be sure to put them to sleep by any means necessary, especially CIO, which is the most effective form. Extinction CIO is cruel beyond belief and the only thing that truly works because parents are a distraction. The Sleep Lady Shuffle and Ferber method are really CIO in disguise or Controlled Crying and so much better than Extinction. All three of these will prevent your child from ever bonding with you in a healthy way. Bedsharing and gentler forms of settling will cause your child to become too dependent on you.

Topping the baby off before bed will help prevent night wakings. When babies wake at night, it isn’t because they are hungry. If the baby wants to nurse to sleep, press on the baby's chin to close its mouth. Don't stop the baby from nursing when asleep because that doesn't cause a bad habit. Be wary of night feeds. If you respond too quickly with food or comfort, your baby is manipulating you. Babies can’t manipulate. Babies older than six months can manipulate.

Sleep when the baby sleeps. Clean when the baby cleans. Don’t worry. Stress causes your baby stress and a stressed baby won't sleep.

My son has also been looking for a part time job to help with bills because he sees how stressed I am. He finally got hired! He's going to be working at McDonald's, but just one thing before he can start working - he has to get a haircut.

But, he went today and got it all cut off so that he can work at McDonald's an. d help his Mom pay the bills until things get better.

Daughter - ""Dad, I need to go to Build-A-Bear for the donation.""

Me - ""What donation?""

Daughter - ""At school, they are collecting bears for donation.""

Me - ""Okay, we'll drop by Target and get a cheap one.""

Daughter - ""No, it has to be a good one from Build-A-Bear.""

Me - ""Fine, we'll go and see if they have any sales, but I'm not spending a lot of money.""

We get to Build-A-Bear and pick out the smallest, cheapest teddy bear. I told her that we wouldn't get the bear an outfit.

Me - ""What is this donation anyways?""

Daughter - ""We are taking teddy bears to the kids who will spend Christmas in the hospital and who won't get to have Christmas toys. It's really important and I really, really want to get a teddy bear for them. You don't even have to spend money. I'll pay for it. You can take it out of my piggy bank.""

While trying my hardest not to cry, I turned around and exchanged the cheap bear for a normal sized/priced teddy bear. My daughter gleefully helped build the bear with the staffperson.

Daughter - ""Okay, we're ready. You said no outfit.""

Me - ""Sweetheart, grab any outfit you want. We'll get it.""

As we check out, my daughter took my credit card and paid.

Daughter - ""I need to swipe it because I'm going to give my dad money from my piggy bank for it. It's for the kids in the hospital.""

Again, daddy tears.

I told my daughter it was $10, but it was quite a bit more. She was really insistent on paying the $10, so I'll let her do it. It should give her a more tangible sense of accomplishment. I'll probably find a way to give/reward her the $10 back.

So here is what happened:
Before I confronted him about his behavior, we got into a really ""heated"" argument after he said something really fucked up to the kids once again. I basically blew my top. In the midst of the argument, I told him that I feel like he is a bully that uses his ""power"" against his own children because he would never talk to me or any other adult like that because he would get his ass kicked. Yes, I know. I am not proud of how I did it however, I meant what I said. He left the house for a couple of hours after that. Did not speak to me for another two days until I confronted him. He told me that he had nothing to say to me since I believe that he gets some kind of joy from discipling our children. I told him that he had it all wrong. It was not JUST the discipline but how he treats them in general. I asked him why does he feel the need to treat his children like shit? He of course disagreed. Then I finally resulted to showing him my reddit post. Before reading it, he told me that ""people on reddit will agree with him because they are just as awesome as he is."" Needless to say, he was very shocked when he read the responses. He did not speak for a while and sat with his head in his hands. 

The next day, he took the kids to the movies (something he would NEVER do). To see ""Happy Feet 2"" (again, something he would NEVER do). The kids were so happy. The first time be took them anywhere by himself. That night we talked and I told him how happy I was that he did that but he has to do more. He needed to change his attitude especially in parenting. He admitted that he had no idea that he was being a jerk. He thought he was just being funny and no harm was being done. While he is still reluctant to see a professional, he did agree to looking for a therapist that he would feel comfortable with.

**I honestly believe that showing him what I posted on reddit and the responses I got back, made an absolute difference in my husband. Your responses showed him that he was some fucked up shit, whether it was his intention or not, to his kids. He did not want to be that father. He is not close to his father and he did not want that for his kids. Thank you guys so much for your honesty and helpful advice. I wish I could give you all a hundred karma ;-)  But seriously, I am a reddit success story!**

tl;dr: After reading the reddit post, husband admitted he needed help and is trying to change. ",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,True,,,True,t3_n6fnz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/n6fnz/update_my_husband_is_awesome_but_not_to_our_kids/,

I made this account specifically because I just wanted to share an experience I had yesterday that really impressed me with the lengths a parent will go to for their child's happiness.

I'm currently in the Jersey City, NJ area (here on business from out of town), and decided to go into Manhattan this weekend to see some of the city as I had the day off. After a full day, I head back to the PATH train (or ""subway"" for any fellow out-of-towners haha) to begin the journey back to my hotel. 

As I'm awaiting the train's arrival, I notice the area is filling up very quickly with cyclists. Seriously, there was me and maybe two or three other people, then out of nowhere about 100 bicycles and their riders in full riding apparel. Curiosity getting the better of me, I approach a girl nearby and ask what was going on. She informed me there was a big charity race of some kind that had been going on all day and they were now all heading home.

Curiosity satiated, I board the train and begin the trip. Sitting across from me was a man and his son (the kid was sleeping leaned up against his dad). Both had bike helmets on, but neither was wearing any other biking gear, nor did I see either of them holding on to a bike. I strike up a conversation with the father and ask if they were part of the race and if they had enjoyed it. The man just grinned and said that while they had watched the race all day, they weren't participants. I sort of stumbled for words at this point saying something along the lines of, ""Ah okay, I just assumed you guys were participants because of the helmets.""

Thinking our conversation at an end, I started to turn away, but he continued. He told me,

*""My son has suffered from a form of seizures all his life that cause him to sometimes lose consciousness. It can happen literally at any time. So since he was old enough to walk he's had to wear a special helmet to protect his head when he falls. He was fine with it until he first started school and some of the other kids were mean to him and poked fun. So I bought a bike we can both ride and usually take him to and from school with it. When the other kids try to poke fun, he now just tells them 'I just want to stay ready in case my dad shows up to get me early!' Now he's really into the whole cycling scene and we go to as many events like this as we can. He sees all the other people wearing helmets and just can't get enough.""*

I really wanted to hear more, but their stop arrived and he got up and carried his son off the train. I'm not a parent myself, but I hope one day when I am that I've got even half the Dad skills of this random stranger on the train. Just thought I'd share.

**TL;DR - Awesome dad makes his son less self-conscious about having to constantly wear a helmet for medical reasons by taking him to biking events, picking him up from school on a bike, and wearing a helmet of his own.**",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_1dstlc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1dstlc/amazing_dad_goes_above_and_beyond_keep_up_his/,

Life sometimes rarely seems to make sense and the loss of my son will always haunt me if i try to question it.

Last Thursday i received a frantic call from the wife that my son Dax was not breathing, he was put down to sleep after a bottle at my mother in laws house. When she got back to him he was unresponsive and not breathing. Once the paramedics arrived they were able to get a airway and get him to the emergency room. While waiting at the emergency room the doctor let us know that our son was as sick as a body could possibly be and at best his chances were under 20%. They transported him to the OU childrens hospital here in oklahoma via Helicopter, when we arrived the doctor there gave us the news no parent ever dreams they would have to hear "" Your son is not going to make it, even if he pulled through he would never be able to function as even a baby does. ""  However they did everything in there power to verify the horrible words of the doctor, less then 24 hours from then my sons kidneys were failing, completely dependent on a ventilator and blood pressure medicine. They gave us time to get family in to say our goodbyes and one final chance to hold our son in our arms.

Devastation would be the best way to put how we felt even with the support of multiple family members and our pastor we were struggling to even answer any questions let alone make one last final decision in our sons life.

We chose to allow the hospital through a program called life share take our sons heart for the valves in order to possibly give life to another in our darkest hour.

I never thought in my wildest dreams anything like this could happen to us, don't wait to play with your kids, don't push off seeing family and friends, doing the things we cherish in life can never be quick enough but i promise you in a blink of a eye it can be too late.

Sometimes when people come to the vet they bring their kids, great no problem.  Alot of kids like to see their cat or dog being checked out by the vet and ask questions, again great no problem.  Sometimes kids want to get right up close to the table while we are examing their pet, this is a problem.   We always ask kids to step away from the table for their own safety in case thier pet gets scared or angry and lashs out.  Most parents have no problem keeping their kid at a safe distance, but for some reason their is a small percentage of you who fight us tooth and nail about this.  ""Fluffy is fine she would never scratch the kids""  ""Duke would never dream of biting anyone, your being ridiculous""  ""You just hate kids!""  
  Today a mother and her young daughter, maybe 3-4 yrs old came in with their cat who is know for being difficult.  I have to wear large leather gloves and use a towel just to get him out of the carrier.  We repeatedly told this mother to please keep her daughter away from the cat. She told us we were being dramatic and that the cat would never hurt her, it just didn't like us.   We finished the exam, put the cat back in the carrier and the owner walked out to the front desk to pay.  I told the little girl to not put her hands near the carrier because the cat was still angry.  Her mom looked at me and said, ""We're fine you can go now"" in a not so nice tone.  I walked out back and seconds later heard this girl scream.  She had opened the carrier to pet the cat and it bit her in the hand really badly.  She had to go to the hospital.
  Please, please parents trust use when we tell you to step back.  When animals are scared and in fight mode they do not care who's hand is in their face, they will bite you.  We don't hate your kids, we're not trying to ruin their learning experience, we're not saying you have a horrible pet. We just know the nature of animals, this is our job. We are just trying to help you and your pet have the happiest, safest visit you can.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_1adpcl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1adpcl/parents_with_pets_please_hear_me_out/,

Took us about 45 mins, a huge tupperware bowl, raisins, cranberries, and his favorite nuts..  and we had to put together a makeshift ""cage"" for the night. 

I stood at my son's door for a few mins after I'd tucked him in, listening to him telling charlie how proud he was of him, what a brave, strong hamster he was, how much he'd missed him, etc.

It was enough to bolt me out of bed! Keep in mind my husband moved out about a year ago so my 14yo son ( who is 5ft 11in and 180 lbs) is the oldest man in my home. His name is Nando, and his room is next to mine and he flew out of bed also. I grabbed a bat and walked towards my bedroom door to check on all of my 3 sons. Instead He ran into my room, took the bat from me, and told me to stay behind him.  I hesitated for only a second before i let him lead the way as the protector. And i felt safe! k
Instantly I knew he was mentally and physically strong enough and smart enough to take that role now.... as the man of my house. Not just in word but also in deed. And he had been stepping into that role all this time. It took a scary situation to make me see that. The crash was a box falling into a glass coffee table. But the event was quite an enlightening experience.    He is a redditor also so i wanted to write this post to say this to him.    Nando, I'm so proud of the awesome young man you have become. I hope i helped a little. I love you very much.     , Mom.    Edit: someone asked me for a picture. [This](http://imgur.com/5tBkB) is one of my favorites.

Don't read this if you can't be sad right now.,akrabu,621,119,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/swot1/my_7monthold_daughter_died_i_couldnt_figure_out/,"I have meant to share this with Reddit for a while. It is hard to type or think about even now but I feel like this is one of the things I have to do. It has been a month since we lost her. I can't explain how I feel about Reddit, but I feel like you anonymous friends of mine should know and be offered the opportunity to join us in our grief if you want to.

Her name was Bloddueth. It is the name of the Welsh goddess of springtime and fertility. We are non-religious but we like Welsh names and thought it sounded pretty. She was the happiest and healthiest baby that ever lived. Well she was my cranky baby, but she had gone full happy a couple of weeks before she died. Everyone fell in love with her. I couldn't take her anywhere because everyone wanted to fawn over her and any sort of shopping or activity took 10 times longer than it normally would have. Many times I would just take her to places just because I thought she would make the people there happy. I took her to the office of my physical therapist and it took me over an hour to recapture her and leave. So many people I barely even knew just loved her. She was so perfect. I felt bad for my 3-year-old because she used to get a lot of attention but not nearly as much as Blue (we called her blue for short.) At her age people would literally be all over Blue and not even say hello to my other girl. I know every parent thinks their kid is the most wonderful thing that ever existed, but don't take my word for it I will just post a few pics of her and you will see what I mean: http://imgur.com/a/YPtCh

I'm a stay-at-home-dad and Mommy was at work that day. She was really happy and really silly that evening. Blue, my other girl, and I spent the whole day goofing around. We had been trying to enforce a sleeping schedule of sleep whenever you want but we had to try and keep her awake from 5 to 9 so that mommy wouldn't be up all night with the fussbutt. She was happy, but kind of falling asleep while I had her on my lap playing with her. I texted my wife at work at 8ish to tell her that I felt bad keeping her awake because she is really sleepy, asking her if it would be cool if I put her to bed earlier than 9. Well I didn't wait for her response because I figured she would be okay with it. I had already put a lot of work into keeping her happy and awake so I just took her upstairs to her bed. We cosleep by default but Blue had a special toddler bed for naps because unlike my firstborn, she wouldn't sleep in my arms or in any room where people were doing things. So in a roundabout way she demanded her own sleep space. I took her up to her bed and she went to sleep the same way she always did when sleep was her decision. I set my phone alarm for 8:20 and when 8:20 came around I checked on her. She might have been dead at this point I am not sure. I just checked to make sure she was sleeping soundly and not squirming or fussing. She looked asleep at a glance so I set my phone for 8:40. I needed to set these alarms because she wouldn't necessarily cry out, but she had a fussy squirmy way of sleeping when she wasn't going to stay asleep that I needed to interrupt and fix so she could be sleeping when mommy came home from work. At 8:40 my other girl asked for a bath so I took her upstairs and started drawing a bath for her. I walked right by Blue to do this but when I came back to actually check on her something seemed off about the way she was sleeping. I took a step or two into the room and I knew before even touching her that she was dead. I tried and tried everything I could to bring her back. It took me I think 5 or 10 minutes to call 911 because time stopped and I just wanted my baby to be alive. I kept pumping on her chest and trying to get air into her lungs. I tried to make my phone work several times but I couldn't do it and I couldn't stop trying to keep blood going into my poor baby's brain. There was nothing wrong with her. She was just dead.

You never expect your child to just be dead for no damn good reason. But, I want to talk about the other things you don't expect when you lose a child unexpectedly. The police, much like the rest of life, don't talk to them. In fact, fuck those fucking scumbags! If your child unexpectedly dies I learned that the police will interrogate you and harass you. I'm not talking about the next day or anything. I'm talking about all fucking night long when you just want to be with your family. They won't let you in your house unless you sign their permission slip to investigate your house until 4 in the fucking morning. If you tell them to fuck off and go get a warrant, they will tape off your house as a crime scene until then and you are fucked even worse. They will try to convince you to pay out of your bleeding asshole for a polygraph test (interrogation) and they will generally turn your living hell into a waking nightmare. That's standard practice. We actually got off easy compared to some of the stories you can find. I just feel lucky that when CPS came, and they did, that they let my other baby stay with her parents, because we had a third-party supervisor (super-grandma came to stay with us.)

Anyways, she died because of fluid in her lungs. I think more specifically hypoxia. She had ever-worsening allergies leading her to be really really clogged up in her sinuses. Maybe, she inhaled a bunch of mucous in her sleep, IDK, maybe she inhaled some milk or some water at some previous time? We'll never know for sure. They tested the fluid and never really figured out what it was or what caused it.

The other thing you can never expect from losing a child is that everyone else wants to grieve too. They need you to be a part of it too. They can't be sad for the baby that they didn't lose, they need to be sad for the parents. I get it, and I did my best to help these people, so so many people, but it still sucks. I had to give the news to so many people and watch them just die inside because for them, my beautiful baby just died regardless of how long I have been living with it. Also, everyone wants to help somehow. The only thing that would actually help is if your baby wasn't dead, and they all recognize the futility of trying to help and so do you. So it doesn't matter how utterly helpless you are, you have to pretend that there are things they can help with. 

After people stop trying too hard to save a day that is long gone, they avoid you. Yeah, those people who suddenly would do anything for you expect that you are still a big bundle of bummer and they avoid you. They say they are there for anything, and then they abandon you. I get that too. Who the fuck wants to hang around people who are fucking sad to the extent that it wears off on you? Even if you pretend that you've moved on, it doesn't matter because they know you haven't. I can't handle my perpetual sadness so I avoid it as much as possible. But yeah no one else can handle the anxiety of hanging around with a person you expect to ball their eyes out any second either. I don't blame the plethora of people who care about us for avoiding us. I would be much more distant myself if this shit had never happened to us. 

Another thing life doesn't prepare you for is losing control of your emotions. Before losing my baby I was the master of my mood and my emotions were my bitch. Now I am either crazy fucking happy and desperate for human contact trying way too hard to pretend like nothing happened, wallowing in misery, or more irritable than I ever imagined I could get or just plain fucking mean (mostly on the internet.) I fucking argue with everyone about everything and what's worse is I can't even control it. I feel bad as it is happening and I can't turn it off. Look at my comment history. I have been horribly insulting and confrontational. That's one of the worst parts of it all is that now I am being a huge dick to people about shit I don't even really care about and I can't turn it off. I will regret what I am saying to people as I am saying it. 

There were some positive things. I don't want to talk about them because I hate the fuck out of those things because they never would have happened if my baby girl didn't die. 

I just want to hold her one more time, just for a second. Every day I try to remember what it was like to hold her and I can't. All I can remember is what she felt like dead. If this sort of thing ever happens to you. DO NOT FUCKING FEEL PRESSURED INTO GRIEVING THE WAY YOU THINK PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO. Get really really selfish, and don't fucking hold her dead body, and don't fucking smell her hair, and kiss her head, or pat her on her cute little tushy again. Don't even look at your child if it's dead. You will never be able to forget that shit and you need to be able to remember the good stuff without all of that horrible getting in the way. You never hear anyone say, ""I wish I could remember how cold and lifeless my loved-one was."" 

I mostly wanted to type this up because I wanted to share some of the things that caught me by surprise, but I wanted to share as much as I could bare with my anonymous internet family. 

I know at least one person will read through all of my crap here. I'm sorry. I don't want anyone to feel bad but I just feel so fucking fucked right now and I have to talk about it with someone. I can't handle looking at any more empty dead eyes when I tell them that our wonderful girl is dead. My pain isn't unbearable, but seeing how people react to it is. 

I lost track of what I was saying but one more awesome thing about Blue was that she was really strong. The day after she was born we figured out that she could hold on to my index fingers with her tiny hands and stand up. She was something to behold in a jumper.

I know that many of you do as well.


Posting a picture of your kids, no matter how cute you think they are (mine is cuter anyways) provides **no content whatsoever**. 


There's a notice in the sidebar, but no one seems to care.


Now, most of these posts manage to reach the front page with only 60-100 upvotes. That is ridiculously small, when you consider that there are 29 000 suscribers to r/parenting. It's been proven in countless other subreddits that ""letting the downvotes talk"" is not enough. To keep the quality of a subreddit like the one we have here, we need thorough moderation.

There's a reason r/cutekids is a completely dead subreddits, it's because : **no one cares about pictures of strangers' kids.** I'm not trying to be an asshole. I'm the first one to post pictures of my daughter on facebook, all the time. Because my friends and family on facebook know me and they care, at least a little.


The last thing we want, is this amazing subreddit to turn into the joke that is r/daddit, which is: nothing but pictures of some random kids.


Please can we open up a serious discussion on this, the rules of moderation need to be changed and I'd be happy to help out with it.

**[EDIT]** : 

Two great solutions have been put forward.


1- Create a bot that deletes every link pointing to imgur with a respectful suggestion to post them in /cutekids instead. Please see moderator /davidjayhawk's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/161q0s/meta_all_right_folks_can_we_outright_ban_cute/c7s0auq)


2- Create a special day like Imagefest Friday (credit to u/miparasito for the idea) where such content is allowed and even encouraged. This could probably be enforced by a Bot though I actually have no idea.


I actually think option 2 is the best. Like I said further up here, I don't want to be officer asshole. My main concern is to preserve the general quality of this subreddit and we need to prevent low-effort-low-content posts from suffocating the quality content and drive away users who contribute to this great subreddit. I can also undertand why people **do** want to look at cute pictures or share their own pictures.

The teenager has been suffering with Crohn's Disease now for eleven years. The youngest had severe jaundice at birth, spent a week (thank goodness only a week when so many others spend so much longer) in the NICU, and until around her third birthday was flat as a board. Wooden. Puppet-like. Diagnosed with autism and given speech, behavioral, and occupational therapy for around a year through our state's early intervention program. She now attends preschool through our town's special education program. Both are doing quite well right now, actually, but my oldest nearly died three years ago, receiving blood transfusions as doctors prepared to perform emergency surgery (that incidentally, was never performed. An infusion drug saved her life and then later nearly killed her as she reacted very badly to it and was re-hospitalized, but the danger had passed.) The youngest has ""recovered"" from her ""autism"" so completely that next year she'll be returning to her special education preschool class as a peer model and then entering mainstream kindergarten. She smiles and waves and giggles and hugs, plays imaginatively with her toys, cracks jokes, and is basically an utterly normal three year old girl. If I told  you she was autistic you'd think I'd been watching too many daytime talk shows and reading too many parenting magazines. She's fine. I don't mean she's doing very well for a kid with autism. I mean that I challenge anyone to find a shred of autistism anywhere about her. It's just not there.

The point of all this introduction? We've experienced, my wife and I, having a child nearly die. We've gotten to the point of panic, of anticipated grief, reached the moment where we've stopped sugar coating things for our eleven year old daughter and explained to her about death and what various people have to say about the afterlife. We've experienced the ""sure"" knowledge that our youngest will surely be disabled all her life and what the ramifications of that will be for her, for us, for her own children should she choose to have any.

In other words, we're experienced parents. This isn't our first rodeo. We've been scared shitless, been put at the mercy of ""experts"", mollified, terrified, and put through a wringer. And, sometimes in spectacular fashion, we've come out of the other end of the wringer and noticed that experts that tortured us with nightmare scenarios turned out to be wrong. That if you haven't done your own research, you can't rely on the advice of others who say they have. Maybe this is why my perspective on the nonsense that goes on at my children's schools seems to be so different from the other parents around me.

We live in a small town south of Hartford Connecticut, about a half hour's drive to Newton, Connecticut, where twenty small children and six faculty members were shot to death by Adam Lanza. That shooting, I'm somewhat ashamed to say, affected me far more personally than any mass school shooting that preceded it. It was too close, for one thing. For another, I now have a small child of a similar, defenseless age. I can not and do not want ever to fathom what it must be like to hear from a frantic friend's phone call, or the news, or a town official, that your child's school is barricaded by police, that people have been killed, that no one is being allowed anywhere near the place. And later, that your tiny child was one of the victims. I can think of no greater personal terror.

Nevertheless, before Newtown, and even more so *after* Newtown, I'm angered by what I find at my children's schools whenever I need to interact with the people there. Why? A couple of reasons, one of which is math. The other of which is the erosion of our communities and what used to be American culture.

Years ago when I would pick up my older daughter at elementary school, I'd gather with the other parents in front of the main entrance where the ""walkers"" were dismissed. The doors were locked and could only be opened from the inside. Theoretically, if you wanted to enter the front lobby of the school, you'd hit the doorbell, present yourself to the camera, and after the school receptionist decided you were safe, the doors would buzz and you'd be let in.

In practice, most of us know what really happens. You press the doorbell, or someone else does. The bored receptionist who's gone through this performance a million times since that buzzer was installed, probably around 2001, barely looks up at you half the time, and buzzes the door open. You, or someone else opens the door, and, around half the time, the small crowd of parents who arrived around the same time as you did all shuffle through, holding the door for one another. Multiply this process by ten if it's raining or snowing or bitterly cold. Do you know every parent of every child in your kids' school? Would you slam the door in the face of someone you didn't recognize? You may claim you would in the hypothetical, but in reality almost no one would. It's against human nature to do it. Only the most paranoid individual would do such a thing.

However, the problem with that buzzer isn't just that it's ineffective at the function it's intended for, which is to subject every entrant to the building to screening by the office staff. The problem with that buzzer is that it treats every parent of every child in that school as a potential threat and criminal. It elevates the base level of suspicion of every non-staff adult on school grounds from nearly none, which is appropriate given the numbers, to likely-to-be-a-problem. It assigns every adult on the premises a higher-than-background level of presumed guilt. This is wrong. It's an erosion of community. If you think there is no profound psychological effect in being treated even superficially as a criminal or a prisoner, look up the Stanford Prison Experiment sometime.

A child raised to believe that a locked glass door on a school protects him from crazed shooters, and that such a protective measure is worthwhile despite the vanishingly small chance of an attack, is also being raised to believe that the TSA is protecting him by violating his 4th amendment rights every time he chooses to get on an airplane, or soon if things continue on the current trajectory, board a bus or a train. This despite the fact that the TSA has never caught a single terrorist, has never foiled a single plot, has never had a finding that led to a conviction of absolutely anyone. Quite the opposite, in fact. Every single internal audit that the TSA has ever conducted on themselves, they have failed. They have failed to detect simulated weapons and bombs and allowed them to pass checkpoints. Every time. Think about that for a moment. They have failed every test they've been given, but they continue to be allowed to frisk your children when you're on your way to Disney World. Why do you allow that?

Why do you allow your child's elementary school to be modeled as a junior prison? Checkpoints, locked doors, buzzed entry, man-traps at some schools even.

2.4 million people died in the United States in 2010. 16,000 of those were from homicides. Let's put that homicide number in perspective. That's, first of all, all types of murder, using guns, poison, blunt objects, a push down the stairs, etc. Secondly, just so you know, more than 3 times as many Americans died of the *flu* in that same time period. Only 0.6% of deaths in the US in 2010 were the result of homicide of any kind. That's less than one percent, in case you missed the decimal point. 

Of those murders, which account for around half of one percent of all deaths in the US, only 0.4% are from mass shootings.

Pour a swimming pool into a painter's bucket. Now pour the painter's bucket into a thimble. Now dump the thimble out on the ground. The moisture remaining in the thimble is a pretty good visual of the likelihood that your kid is going to be shot at school, as compared to the sopping mess you've now got on the ground from dumping your swimming pool out, which represents the likelihood that it's never going to happen.

To combat this non-threat, you're allowing your child's school to be locked like visiting hours at a correctional facility, yourself to be subject to scrutiny as if you need to feel slightly guilty about bringing Timmy's bag lunch after he forgot it. You're allowing your kids to be subjected to lockdown drills where they're taught to lock the doors and huddle in a corner away from the windows, being absolutely quiet lest a hypothetical crazed mad man hear them.  In some districts, police officers roam the halls, banging on classroom doors and begging to be let in, to teach the students to remain hidden even under duress. Some have planned to go even farther and simulate the sounds of gunfire.

Do you think the maybe-subtle, maybe-not psychological trauma and habituation of these repeated drills is worth the chance that your child will be saved from the infinitesimally small chance of a shooter? I think you need to take some statistics classes if you do.

When I went to school, and probably when many of you did, the doors were unlocked. We walked right in. Often, my mom found me in class, never having even stopped at the office, when she needed to drop off my lunch, or some medication I'd forgotten, or to remind me that I needed to pick my brother up after school (no cell phones then, either). Nobody died as a result of this callous disregard for our safety, in our school. Hardly anybody at all did in the entire country.

More people die from Alzheimer's Disease than from murder. More people die of diabetes. If it makes sense to lock your child's school in case of rampaging murderers, then it makes sense to make them walk around in a lightning proof cage lest they be struck. The only difference is psychological, not statistical.

By the way, Newtown had a locked door, and a video intercom. Just like my kids' schools. Just like your kids' schools. So much for that.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_196xxv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/196xxv/your_kid_wasnt_shot_today_tomorrow_looks_pretty/,

I left her, I couldnt partake in her choices and irresponsibility. I hated her. Then it hit me, ""holy shit, I just made a decision that will effect a human for the rest of its life and shes not even born yet"". I created a statistic. That week, she went into labor 3 months early. My beautiful little angel was born 2.4 pounds and could fit in my hand. Her face, changed my life in a flash. Im a father?!! I did not leave the hospital for 4 days, at all. My daughters mother left the 3rd day, to never return.
    I was a father! But more than that, I was a mother now too. I was lost, yet somehow relieved that the responsibility of this beautiful being was solely mine and mine alone. It gave me strength to know that I can change her life from this second on. I can be by her side, no matter what. I can love. I can be loved! Then the docs told me, she had some bleeding on the brain, Some ""development issues"" that could be permanent and a blood infection to boot. It wasnt looking good. Four days of Heaven stolen in one second.
     Three months later, a nurse told me, after a long battle, that she had never in her 23 year career, seen a father so dedicated. I told her, ""Thanks, its the MOM in me!"". I was told my daughter could come home once she learned to take the bottle by herself. It would be a while but there was a light at the end of my tunnel. My amazing little girl took her very first bottle, the whole thing, by herself. PRIDE OVERWHELMED ME. I brought my little angel home that evening.
   In 2 weeks, my little one will turn 4 years old. She now has an 8 year old adopted sister and a 2 1/2 month old little brother. Life is good. Oh and business is booming, I look around and see all the joys of life I never had as a child. Everyday I hear a friend or family member say how wonderful of a parent I am. Though I am a humble person, I say thank you and pretend it's just my duty. When in fact, inside, another spark, ignites another flame and another reason to give these beautiful children another kiss and/or hug and thank them for saving my life. But more, for finally giving me something I succeeded at. For showing me that a father, is exactly what I was always meant to be. I love you Jaelynn, Bryanna and Liam. To my wonderful fiance, who will never see this because she thinks Reddit is for nerds, Thank You for being my homie!

1359730912.0,436,self.Parenting,17p2l1,I was asked to cross-post post this here.... post-Newtown attitude at my kids' school.,TheGarp,516,80,276,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/17p2l1/i_was_asked_to_crosspost_post_this_here/,"So after the shooting in Newtown, some of the kids at my kids' school were scared to go to school. A couple of the dads went with their kids and just sat in class with them. After a day or two the dads were reading with little groups, walking them to recess, and the teachers loved it. Shortly after, they had their first 'practice' of a gunman incident at the kids' school. It was just a drill where the teachers turned off the lights, locked the doors, basic stuff. A couple of dads showed up and were at the main entrance, allowed to hang out by the playground. Just to be there.

School says all of the kids' anxiety went down and kids said they felt safer with the dads there.

Since, more dads have volunteered to come to the school. Help in out in the library, eat lunch with the kids, be playground monitors, door watching to make sure the doors are locked from the outside that should be, stuff like that.

We had a meeting at the school last night and apparently there are about 20 other schools nationwide doing essentially the same thing and our school is now implementing it as an official program. Dads can sign up for shifts and positions in the school on their days off and stuff. The school says that since this has started, bullying is non existent, no one's getting hurt on the playground either. At the Jr. High, no one's fighting in the halls, and when they sit with the kids that sit alone at lunch, other kids come and sit and the quiet kids are now participating in class way more.

I have offered to research the quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits this is having and hope they take me up on it. Fathers, involved with their school having a very surprising and measurable effect there. Shocking.

My son splits his time 50/50 between my house (me + my fiance) and his dad &amp; stepmom. My fiance and I sat him down last night and let him know that he wasn't in any trouble, but we needed to talk to him about his online activities. Asked him who he preferred to chat with and he chose my fiance.

He was very open and willing to talk. Went over the regular safe sex and internet things (like dangerous sites/unusual porn/etc). Turns out the kids at school had dared him to visit the sites and had been teasing him because he hadn't done it yet. 

This makes sense as he's still seemed fairly asexual to date. My fiance let him know that he could always come to one of us if he is curious about these internet sites or has kids teasing him/daring him to visit them, we'd be happy to show him.

He also let my son know that when he's ready for ""material"" he'd help him find something suitable.

We also have a book on order he can read through on his own.

All in all, I'm pretty pleased with the outcome of this conversation. I think having a chance to talk to a trusted adult that wasn't his parent really helped him open up. Later he told me that he would have happily talked to me if I'd been the only one there, but that he felt it was easier with someone of the same sex. I reassured him that I completely understood.

We figured it would be quick so we decided that the kids and I would tag along. We have one two year old son named Roman and a nine month old daughter named Adelai. The appointment went on far longer than we had expected so I figured it would be best to waste some time with the kids. Food is always good. I walked the kids over to a Subway figuring I could grab a sammich and split it between the three of us. Our sammich was nearing completion when Roman grabbed his rear end and yelled, ""POOOOOOOOOOP!!!!!"" This, I believe, is the universal sign for crapped pants. I looked at him with defeat then back to the ""sammich artist"".

""It's alright, sir. I have kids. I'll be waiting for you to get back."" The ""artist"" had no idea what was in store for me or she would have offered much stronger condolences.

THE BATHROOM

I looked in vain for a clean place to put Adelai. The only option was the floor so I ripped off a few pieces of toilet paper and laid them on the floor. Perfect. I set her down and immediately turned my sights to Roman. 

""Let's do this!"" 

I pulled his shorts down and felt his butt to see if I could locate the rogue ""turd-le"". Confidence morphed into horror when my hand squished against his bottom. A quick glance only confirmed my suspicions. Diarhea. Why? I look back to see Adelai had started eating her toilet paper seat.

""Hey! Don't eat that!""

A six-toothed grin helped me realize that she wasn't planning on stopping. I then pulled Roman's Incredibles underwear down and plopped him on the toilet. He promptly started peeing and congratulating himself for using the potty. While Roman rejoiced at his own intelligence I scooped up Adelai and headed for the sink. 

""Roman, let me know when you are done pooping, alright?""

""Yeeeeeah."" Roman replied.

I filled the sink with hot water and hand soap and threw the underwear in. Making a claw out of my hand I started the wash cycle. My hand vigorously swooshed and swished the underwear in it's hot and soapy bath. Adelai was fascinated with the soapy mess and began to launch off of my hip into the ""washing machine"". I held tight and moved onto the rinse cycle.

""How's it coming back there, kiddo?""

""Yeeeeeah."" Roman replied while staring at his feces-covered legs.

With the rinse cycle over I looked at the soaking wet underwear. Mr. Incredible had a brown goatee so I put them back in for more rinsing. After that rinse, our hero looked like he only had a five o' clock shadow. Good enough. I then wadded the underwear up with some paper towels and waited for them to dry. Suddenly I heard water running and looked to the sink. Hmmm, no water there. I hear it again only to discover it is the rest of Roman's diarhea escaping into the bowl. Poor guy. 

""You done, friend?""

""No. Still pooping. Not done.""

I entertained Adelai for a few minutes while I wondered if the ""artist"" was listening to any of this. Several minutes went by when I Roman let me know he was finished. I set Adelai back onto her paper seat by the door and I went to work cleaning Roman off. My eyes glance over my shoulder to an empty toilet paper throne. The girl was gone. She couldn't have gone far. My greatest fears are forming as I see two chubby legs behing the urinal partition.

""NOOOOOOOOO!""

It was too late. Behind the partition I find my nine-month old daughter with her lips firmly secured to the edge of the urinal. I yank her away and look at the urinal in discuss. There are yellow spots everywhere but where her mouth was fastened. There, it is clean. There, it is spotless. I place her back by the door and tell her to sit still. Once more six teeth defied my commands.I managed to finished cleaning Roman. I walked over to the sink to wash his hands when I remembered that I had not looked at Adelai for a whole five seconds. I turn around to see her pulling a poop covered length of toilet paper from the toilet. She mouth was open. She was salivating in anticipation. 

""GYAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!""

I shook it free from her hand seconds before it reached her mouth. She was furious. I cleaned them both thoroughly in the washing machine/sink, put Roman's wet underwear back on him (his request), and brushed my hair over with the back of my hand. A glance in the mirror showed a well put together family that may or may not smell of diarhea. I couldn't be sure as the entire bathroom reeked of it. We returned to ""artist"" and paid for our sammich.

""Cute kids.""

""Thanks, that's why we kept them.""

I smile and we enjoy our meal. Halfway through our meal together I was still smiling.

""I love both of you a lot.""

Roman growled in his monster voice, ""I loooove you tooooo, daaaaddyyyyy!""

Adelai bit me which I considered a positive response.

I like being a dad because I used to go to Subway, order a sandwich, sit down, eat, and leave. Nothing is that boring anymore. People tell me about how having kids ties you down. If having kids ties me down to a life where a simple snack at Subway turns into an excrement covered disaster, give me more kids. I love disasters. Twenty years from now I will have my kids and their friends laughing hysterically when I tell this story.

As grad student Papa, my schedule is more flexible, so I stayed home. Near midday, she tells me that she is going to go upstairs and go to sleep. Before I can say anything, she is walking upstairs. Then she sits down on her potty and goes potty. When I get upstairs, I find that she has taken care of wiping and everything. The only thing she's not done is washed her hands because she is not strong enough to turn on the upstairs faucet.

I ask her if she wants me to read her stories and sing songs, hopeful that she will indeed nap if I do this. She says no. I try to argue with her on this, but she calmly says no. She wants to read herself some books and go to sleep. So I go downstairs and get a cup of coffee. About five minutes later I go upstairs and check on her through the crack in the door. She's sitting up in her bed with an issue of Thor on her lap, gazing out the window, arranging the covers around herself. She pauses a moment, and I see her in profile. In that moment, she looked so happy to have made her own decisions, and content in her solitude. It was pretty magical. For some reason, it made me understand all the more why the last few weeks have been easier putting her to bed at night because I've let her make decisions for herself about what pajamas to wear, what toothpaste to use, what books to read.

Edit: thanks for all the responses. You guys get it! Personhood and bittersweet are the key words. Most magical moment I had in a while and last year I was twenty feet away from a sperm whale.

It got me to thinking of the things I used to do when I had toddlers in the house and I thought I'd share them here.  I hope someone finds them helpful.

* **Analog clocks are great for transitions.**  Even before my kids could tell time we made good use of the clock.  ""You can play until the big hand is at the bottom of the clock"".  Or ""Bedtime is when the big hand is at the top"".  Sometimes I'd put a post-it note on the clock face.  ""When the hand is on the yellow square, it's time for bath.""  One great thing about this was that I could ask my kid, ""is the hand on the yellow square?"" and they'd look for themselves and see that it is.  There was a psychology to that, I got a lot more cooperation I think because it was like they were telling themselves it was time.

* **Take turns instead of Sharing**  My son was the one who gave me the most fits about sharing.  He hated to share.  But I found that he was much less adverse when I'd say he needed to take turns.  I think he thought sharing meant he had to give something up but take turns sounded like he'd get another chance.   

* **Give a specific number of things to put away when cleaning up** When we are not doing our usual chores and I want a quick tidy I still do this with my teens.  I tell my three kids, ""everyone needs to tidy up 10 things.""  30 things tided up makes the house look much better fast!  I find my kids much more willing to cooperate when they know how much they have to do.  Now, sometimes they would try to get away with grabbing a handful of legos and calling it good, so we had to make a rule that smaller things needed to add up to the size of a loaf of bread to count.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_qiljl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/qiljl/just_a_couple_random_tips_i_remember_from_raising/,

It turns out all three of them were very easy infants. At the time I thought they were hard work. Hard but manageable. Crying. Pooping.  Sleeping. Pooping. Crying. Sleeping. Etc. 

They were tough but manageable. I never hit a point where I thought I would lose it. I think 10 or 15 minutes was the max any of them cried before they stopped. And when they went to sleep after their 10 minutes of crying, it was for hours - 7 or 8 at a time. 

I thought it was tough. Tough but manageable. Particularly when the 3rd one came. ""Look at me. I'm managing two toddlers and an infant.""

Parents who complained about how hard their baby was - I'm ashamed to admit, I kind of judged and looked down on. ""Seriously, if I can do it with 2 toddlers and an infant, you can do it with an infant. It's tough. Sure. But manageable.

Tonight my wife and I babysat my friends' infant. He's five months old. His mum and dad are friends of my wife and I, and they've often complained how much parenthood had affected their lives. I've judged them. 

""Just deal with it,"" I've thought. 

""He's gonna be a lot of work,"" they said. Sure, sure. I've had three. One more won't hurt.

My god. He screamed. For 4 hours. Huge desperate screams I've never heard in my life. His body would stiffen as he drew in his breath. His lungs would fill and he would relax slightly, and then stiffen again as he let out an almighty howl. There was pain and helplessness in that scream - sounds I've never heard in 3 babies before. He shook and convulsed.

My wife rocked him. And patted him. And laid him down and tried to let him sort himself out. We put on lullabies, and made sssshhiing sounds. I held him and swayed. I put him in a pram and rocked him back and forward. We tried to feed him and burp him. And still he screamed.

I started to seriously worry. What if there is something really wrong with him? I could feel my stress building. And he kept screaming. Louder and louder, sounding more distressed every minute. 

I called his mum. ""I think there's something seriously wrong with him. He's screaming in pain. I think he might be really sick.""

His mum could hear him through the phone.

""No. He sounds the same as every night. He screams like that for 5 or 6 hours a night. Usually, he'll go for 2 or 3 hours before he falls asleep. Then he'll sleep for 2 or 3 hours before waking up for another 3.

I had no idea. I would have snapped. Honestly, I don't know how parents would cope. Babysitting for one night was enough to test me. How people could cope with that every night? Not to mention the nights, weeks and months of sleep deprivation. Ongoing sleep deprivation, constant screaming every night - how do people not snap?

He fell asleep at about 10:00pm, and his mum collected him soon afterwards. My night was done and I was absolutely frazzled. I had him for 5 hours, 4 of which were spent with him screaming. 

She's got maybe an hour or two of sleep before that screaming starts again. I simply can't imagine that. Every day. Every night. Every day. Every night. Again and again and again.

I don't know how parents of difficult babies do it. All I can say is you are absolute heroes. I've told her to send him around whenever she needs a break. My wife and I can handle the occasional disrupted night. At least it might give our friend some time to recoup. 

I'm sorry parents I've judged. I take it back.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_1fgnbu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1fgnbu/i_take_it_back/,

Got the idea from How To Talk to Kids Will Listen, and Listen So Kids Will Talk.  I tried it on the 4 year old I babysit, and she went on and on about her theories for why leaves are green, why the cat made that noise, why there was a stick in the road...if she ever said ""I don't know!"" I responded with ""Well, do you have any ideas?""  After she was done theorizing, I would always say ""Wow, that's interesting!"" or ""That's a good idea!""  She is a shy girl, and not extremely confident.  But after a few days of this kind of exchange, she offered her opinion on her own and said ""I have good ideas!""

It was pretty cute.  :3

Also, it was pretty amazing how spot-on she would be sometimes, or how very plausible her theories could be.

And I have only one bit of advice. Get out of their way. Kids are born curious. Period. I don’t care about your economic background. I don’t care what town you’re born in, what city, what country. If you’re a child, you are curious about your environment. You’re overturning rocks. You’re plucking leaves off of trees and petals off of flowers, looking inside, and you’re doing things that create disorder in the lives of the adults around you.  

And so then so what do adults do? They say, “Don’t pluck the petals off the flowers. I just spent money on that. Don’t play with the egg. It might break. Don’t....”  Everything is a don’t. We spend the first year teaching them to walk and talk and the rest of their lives telling them to shut up and sit down.

So you get out of their way. And you know what you do? You put things in their midst that help them explore. Help ‘em explore. Why don’t you get a pair of binoculars, just leave it there one day? Watch ‘em pick it up. And watch ‘em look around. They’ll do all kinds of things with it.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_1gf6uf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gf6uf/best_advice_i_ever_read_from_physicist_neil/,

A little time passes and the kids are done eating. The didn't get fussy or loud through the whole meal. The man seems to have gotten up to go to the restroom, but when he comes back he has bought something for the kids as a treat.

My SO says, ""You didn't have to do that!"" and I thank him. 

He says ""No, no, good kids deserve to be treated good! It always makes me happy to see good children, you guys have done so good with these kids!"" And he goes on to talk about his eight grandchildren. In the bag was a cute jar of gumballs. My daughter thanked him for the candy and promised to share with her brother.

It was so great. I wanted to pay for his meal, but the co-manager already had. Talk about instant karma! So I left our waitress a hefty tip, since she looked rather weary and had done a great job. Always paying it forward!

With 3 clicks of the home button you can choose to turn off selected parts of the screen (or all tap input), the home button, and pull down notifications.

For example: let your child flip through your pictures but turn off the area of the screen where they could change items or delete pictures - also turn off the home button so they can't exit the picture app

Just try it you will soon realize its wonders!

She didn't suffocate and the autopsy didn't establish a cause of death (further tests pending). So classic no good reason SIDS death. 

My wife and I also have an 8 year old daughter and a 2.5 year old son. 

We held the funeral 2 weeks ago and Mary was buried. 

While we are struggling with our grief and the rest of the world has moved on, we are wondering what the best way is to memorialise her and use all of this energy that we are currently putting into grieving into something positive. What is a good way for Mary to leave her mark on the world to show that her short life meant something? 

The only things we can think of are a nice garden at home and perhaps donating some money to the Sunday school, Girls Brigade and school that our older daughter goes to that Mary also would have gone to. There is nothing about her death that we can use to become advocates for and the local SIDS organisation has been of so little assistance to us that we don't want them to to use our daughter for fundraising or anything. 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

Since I was nuzzled up with the younger hatchling and not wanting to get up and disturb her, figuring that he probably just wanted to tell me about the latest toy he wants for his bday.  I just ignored him. He then yells ""I sharted in the shower!"" At that point I chuckled and decided that he most certainly would figure out that he needed to just clean his butt and move on with his shower, best place to be in the event of a shart right? He then begins really yelling and the panic in his voice leads me to investigate. I walked into the bathroom and told him to wash his butt and get out. He then says something totally unexpected. ""Well what do I do with the poop?"" I then ripped open the shower curtain and there it was. Not a shart, a fully grown, expertly pinched, good sized little turd loaf hanging out by the drain. I asked him how this could have possibly happened. ""I just farted and it flew out of my butt"". What could I say?? Ha! This was a robust turd so it wasn't going to rinse away, we had to pick it up with toilet paper and flush it. The best part? He keeps a little picture journal that he draws in every day.

1374593740.0,315,self.Parenting,1iw0rw,My daughter (4) killed our kitten.,kittenthrowaway,427,112,358,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1iw0rw/my_daughter_4_killed_our_kitten/,"I'm still in tears and I'm not sure how to handle this. I just need some advice from fellow parents. Please, be kind. And I'm sorry for the huge wall of text. 

My oldest daughter (8) is over at her friend's house, she spent the night, and she doesn't know what happened. This kitten was a gift to her, her other cat got hit by a car just before Christmas last year. She was devastated. Her birthday was this past June, and her best friend (the one who's house she is at right now) had a cat who had just had kittens. So, she gave her one, the best of the litter. We've had him for 4 weeks (he was 12 weeks old on Saturday), but in that time we've all built such a bond with him. He was such an awesome cat. He greeted you at the door when you came home, he killed any fly that managed to make its way into the house, he cuddled and crawled his way up to your neck to wrap his paws around you and hug you. Even the dog became best buds with him. My oldest was enamored with him, and he would come running to her if she walked into the room. My husband hates cats, and I'm not even a cat person myself, but we both agreed, this was legitimately the coolest, sweetest, funniest and most awesome of cats.  

My youngest daughter, she's 4, was upstairs in her room, playing. I checked on her and she was fine, just watching tv and playing in her room. I went downstairs to clean the kitchen. I was down there for about 10 minutes when my daughter came up to me timidly and said ""I'm so sorry...he stopped breathing. His heart isn't working."" I knew before I asked who she was talking about and I bolted upstairs, asking her where he was. She told me the doll baby crib. :( (She had put him in there to try to make him better... ugh...) I grabbed him and he was limp. And here is where my horrible, horrible mom moment came in. I was so distraught and shocked I held him out to her and said ""WHAT DID YOU DO?! WHAT DID YOU DO?!?"" I'm sick just knowing I said that to her. He was dead. My husband walked in the door at that moment from work. I was crying and screaming (I swear, I've never pictured myself this way) and I thrust the cat into his arms and said ""FIX HIM! PLEEAASE!! FIX HIM!!"" He tried to calm me down and took the cat (doing CPR the whole way) to the animal hospital down the street. Before he left he yelled at me (rightly so) to go take care of our daughter, that she was scared.  The whole time I had been so upset about this cat that I had vilified her and let her alone screaming and crying in her room. I feel wretched. 

I went to her and I held her. I told her I forgive her. She kept apologizing. I asked her what had happened. She told me that she had put him under a bucket sat on it, and that he just stopped breathing. I got more out of her later and from putting pieces together. He had been meowing and screaming and clawing at the bucket. He pissed all over under there. And then he suffocated and died. For the first time in her life, I witnessed empathy from her. Little kids don't know empathy. But she cried and she apologized and said ""It was all my fault!"" and ""My poor kitty! He couldn't breathe!"" She kept talking about how her sister was going to be so mad at her and that she didn't want her heart to break too. :( I'm honestly just really glad I don't have a serial killer on my hands. She's still very upset.

We're not supposed to pick up my other daughter from her friend's until later this afternoon. I don't know what to tell her. I definitely do NOT want to tell her it was her sister's fault. I'm right in that, right? They have a very loving relationship. They are friends as well as sisters. If I tell my oldest what really happened, it will cause a wedge, however small, and I don't think she'll ever be able to get over it. I'm afraid the youngest might say something, because she might want forgiveness from her sister. I'm hoping she doesn't. 

I...honestly, I don't know what to do about this! Do I tell the oldest what happened? Do I punish the youngest? More than what the consequences are? I just need some good, kind fellow parenting advice. Please, help. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the kind words and thoughtful advice. You're all helping me more than I thought possible. I really appreciate this. 

**UPDATE- Talked to my oldest**: Thank you to all of you (parents and non-parents) for your advice, kind words, understanding and constructive criticism. I am aware that I am responsible for the death of this poor kitten, and I will be dealing with that guilt for the rest of my life. I'm not a bad mom. My daughter is not a serial killer. She's been alive for 4 years and 1 month. She does not understand death like any of us adults would. Of course she doesn't. Although, unfortunately, she does understand much more now. She and I have talked and she's expressed sorrow and shame and has asked for forgiveness. Such a horrible range of emotions that I wish she hadn't have had to experience at such a young age. But she did. And we're coping. I did not realize the kitten had gone upstairs. He typically stays downstairs. He had been playing with the dog in full view of me while I was cleaning the kitchen. He must have run upstairs and then everything happened within the 7-10 minutes that he had been up there. She's not a malicious child. She's always been sweet to him. I don't think she knew that she was killing him, she doesn't understand oxygen or that the lack of will kill a living being. I don't normally let them be alone together, because, yes, she's 4 and she thinks the cat is a toy. I was cleaning the kitchen when I should have been aware that the cat slipped upstairs. It is MY responsibility, and for that I am more sorry than you could all even possibly understand. 

I'm very thankful for the understanding people in this world. And even for those who would set me straight. It was an accident, but one that I could have probably prevented. When my daughter came home, my husband decided to take the younger one to go get food. I sat down with my oldest and I told her the truth. I told her exactly what happened and that it was an accident. I told her I should have known the cat was upstairs with her and that if I had, this wouldn't have happened. She is...quite honestly, an amazing child. She cried, she was incredibly distraught, but she cupped my face in her hands, wiped my tears as I wiped hers and she said ""Mommy, I'm so sorry you saw that and that you and daddy went through that."" I asked her if she was upset with her sister. I told her it's ok if she is, but I don't want her to be mean to her. She said ""No, I'm not mad at her. She didn't know. I'm really, really sad, but I'm not mad at her."" When my husband walked in the door with my youngest, my oldest went and gave her a hug and said ""I forgive you."" Which made me cry. She's a good kid, and an amazing big sister. 

Thank you to those who told me to tell the truth. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have realized what a kind and loving daughter I have, and a good, forgiving sister my youngest has. 

And to those of you who want to vilify my child and myself, you might want to troll elsewhere. I know I'm a good mom, and I know I have two great kids. Nothing you say will change that for me.

I know it sounds cliche but it's 100% true. Someday I promise you, you will be begging for them to want to be around you. Take it every chance you get. Everyone in my family gets so mad at me because my 3 year old wants to sit in my lap to eat when we go out. I really do understand. They want me to be able to eat a warm meal with both hands. But I just don't mind. My son is 7 my daughter is 3. I can't have anymore children so there's just something about knowing that each time she does it could be the last time she ever asks me to. She isn't needy. She feeds herself. She's not being trouble. She just wants to sit in my lap. Besides, if I didn't let her, I'd miss moments like this.

As a lifeguard I see stupid mistakes happen all the time, which can lead to terrible consequences. 

First of all, most importantly is prevention. If you're child can't swim/is not experienced [these won't do shite](http://imgur.com/OmLNc1X). Invest in Coast Guard approved jackets like [this](http://www.solartex.com/servlet/-strse-569/Child-Life-Vest--dsh-/Detail?gclid=CITmxPydkLgCFVFo7Aod4EMARA) or something similarly Coast Guard Approved.

Swim lessons are a great way for your child to become more comfortable in the water, depending on the class. Firstly make sure the instructor is properly WSI certified or something equivalent to that.

In a class of 5-10 kids, the child may be less likely to retain the information in the excitement of the pool. If you're paying by the hour, the more kids in the group, the less 1-on-1 time your child will be receiving. 

Therefore, I recommend a private or semi-private class with a WSI certified teacher.

If it comes down to it, you need to recognize a drowning victim, or one who will be very quickly. Thanks to popular culture, drowning has become somewhat of a spectacle. Movies and TV shows commonly portray drowning as a sort of dance one might do to prevent death. However drowning victims are going through a pre-determined set of motions in order to keep themselves alive. [**This is a drowning victim**](http://youtu.be/L0KTqPloUiU?t=27s). [This is not](http://youtu.be/Es4Esox8roo?t=3m32s).

Finally, what to do in an emergency. Simple CPR/Rescue Breaths keep people alive, they are simple tools that everyone should know. 

Children: 
&gt;1) Check Airway: Raise chin and search mouth for objects

&gt;2) Check Breathing: Put ear up to mouth, listen closely to breathing and watch chest for rises.

&gt;3) Check Circulation: Place two fingers below jaw, feel for pulse

If pulse but no breathing, perform Rescue Breaths. Give 1 slow breath every 3 seconds. Recheck ABC's every two minutes.

If no pulse/breathing, perform CPR: 15 compressions with one hand between nipples, at 100bpm (Stayin Alive) followed by two, full breaths that should make the chest rise.

I hope you learned something, pass the info on so we can prevent unnecessary tragedies and keep your family safe.

My dad just had a talk with me. It was about how my mom is not normal. She will leave and go without saying goodbye. She does not tuck me and my sister in any more at night. He says she has changed. Now a couple years ago, my dad found out she was cheating on him. I believe it was something to do with hormones, so she took some medicine (As we refer to it ""Happy pills"") and she was back to normal. No longer had this craving to be bad. As time went on she took them less and less, until she stopped. Now she does not want to cheat on my dad (As far as I know, although often I am a bit skeptical). My dad says that other parents help out and love there kids more than my mom does. Thinking back to going over friends houses or whatever, they do seem to be a bit more into their childs life/affectionate. My dad then says he gets lonely sometimes, and is happy he has good friends. So he says she has changed, and it is hard for him because he remembers how it used to be. What do I make of this reddit? They are not going to get a divorce, I know that for sure, it would be way to hard on my sister and I, and we live in a rather large house I know we wouldn't be able to keep if they got divorced. Tell me what you think.






**Edit:** IF you could upvote this that would be great, so I can get a lot of people to see it and get their takes. I get no karma this is a selfpost, and a throwaway account.




**Edit 2**: Thanks for all the responses. I am trying to read all of them, and everyone is saying different things. Talk to your dad, let it be and relax, get counseling, they might get a divorce.

I love them so much but it's so hard and the lack of sleep is killing me. Sometimes when they won't stop crying I just have an urge to physically hurt them. I have even maybe grabbed them or squeezed them a bit too hard on occasion. I can't believe I am like this, sometimes when I'm looking at them I just wonder how I could ever possibly dream of hurting them? What if I actually do it? I just feel like the worst father ever, I want to be good at it and I'm just not...

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and for letting me know that I'm not alone in my feelings. I can't tell you how much of a weight has been lifted off my shoulders just knowing that others have felt this way. Last night was a much better night, I was so much calmer and happier just because I felt relieved.

Some more info on my situation - my wife is off work, I am not and I have a very physically demanding job which is making things a lot more difficult. I feel she could be doing more to be honest, but I know she is exhausted too.

She was hitting him and spraying him and then ran out the door with me to the car.  He was gurgling from the mace and crawling out.  He half caught up with us in the parking lot and wetly screamed   -This is not right.  Run away.  Get safe.  You don't deserve this.-  She took me home and slammed my head repeatedly against the window in the driveway for 'getting caught crying'.  I just took it.  But I remembered him.  I think of him all the time.  He is the reason I ran away time and time again when things got really bad.  He is the reason I started hitting back. I truly believe that he is the reason I'm still alive and the reason I was able to break the cycle.  These little moments matter to kids.  Every glimpse of light to an abused child is like magic.

1369488752.0,283,self.Parenting,1f112q,My 8 month old is wearing glasses and my family thinks less of her,carlinha1289,365,82,204,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1f112q/my_8_month_old_is_wearing_glasses_and_my_family/,"I don't even know where to start as it is ridiculous and it really hurts me. 

My daughter has strabismus (cross eyes) and she has been diagnosed very recently. It wasn't exactly easy to see that she has a problem since something she would look fine and other times not... So anyway, when she was born, my family saw her and the first thing my great uncle said was ""she has a birth defect."" I said ""excuse me?"" and he pointed at her eyes. It doesn't sound so bad written down but he said it in a very insulting way. With time, it started to show less and he mentioned many times that he was very happy that her eyes were fine. 

Fast forward to recently when she got her diagnosis, my great aunt and my mom started crying when they heard she needed glasses. For them, it's no longer a ""perfect healthy"" child. It becomes a ""sick and unperfect"" child. When I asked them why they were crying, they simply said ""she'll look ugly and she will look sick."" That frustrated me and I told them how I was upset at them, how I am grateful she can see and that thanks to today's technology her eye sight problem has good chances of being cured and that I am very proud of her. I then left while my aunt was sobbing. 

I went with my daughter to pick up her glasses and she looks ADORABLE (as usual). So I took a picture and sent it to my sister. Eventually it got to my mom and she showed my aunt. Instead of saying ""oh she's cute"" or not say anything, I get  a phone call from my great aunt saying that she looks awful an that my uncle cannot see her under those conditions, that it would break his heart. She was crying so much I could barely understand her. I just hung up...

I honestly don't know how to deal with that... I cannot believe their reaction. You know what REALLY bothers me? In the family, we ALL have glasses! My great aunt, great uncle, my mom and myself all wear glasses! 

How would you approach this situation/ would you even approach it? 

Update: After reading every single response (so far) I want to thank you all very much. I knew what my family thought was wrong and that it was stupid but it feels good to know that I am not over exaggerating and that it is really ridiculous. I still have no idea what to do. Luckily, we live far away from them and we only visit once in a while (like for my daughter's eye appointments) so we'll see how things go. You guys mentioned it might be some kind of personal fear, I am thinking that you guys are right. I needed glasses in 6th grade because I couldn't see the board and my mom insisted that my sight was fine. I had to wait till grade 8 and fail a test because I couldn't read the words on the board (teacher wanted us to resolve equations she had written on the board and no questions were allowed- ughhhh). 

Anyway, it's probably also cultural. They are Portuguese and very old mentality. I grew up with a lot of mental abuse and I took a lot of ""you can't do that, no one will ever marry you."" and a lot of ""You don't need to be smart, just get a good husband."" So I definitely don't want my daughter to be exposed to these comments and this way of thinking. 

You guys were a great help... Thank

My kids were watching TV quietly in the living room. I shut the drawer and turned around to cover my chicken and put it in the oven. I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye and when I turned I saw the same drawer I just closed slide back open slowly. Now we live in a very old house and its not uncommon to hear weird noises at night. My paranoia was kicking in but I shrugged it off as me being crazy and closed it once more. I took a step back and kept a close eye on it. I watched in horror as it again, slid back open before my eyes.
 At this point I was getting pretty scared. I ran out of the kitchen and went to check on the kids in the living room. My youngest was nowhere to be found! I'm not one to really believe in ghosts but being alone with the kids at night in a big old house can make your imagination run wild. I called her name, and tore through every room in the house. No sign of her. I held my breath and went back into the kitchen, being the very last place I haven't looked. The ghost drawer was still fully opened. As I took a step towards it, it slowly closed by itself then started slamming open and shut, open and shut. I was about to cry until a little leg slid out of the cabinets underneath. My 2 year old emerges from the cabinet under the drawer. She just looked at me and smiled and ran off, back to the living room.

She has spent over 300 hours reading throughout the summer to earn this thing.  Her mom and I didn't push her much at all, but we did occasionally quiz her on the books when she finished them to see if she was paying attention (which she always was).

She got the art set today.  She was bouncing off the walls telling me about it when I got home from work.  I could not believe how proud of herself she was, and obviously I couldn't be prouder.

I know it's a brag post, but it's just nice to have a moment to feel like we're doing something right.

I used to joke that having boys was easier because at least you didn't have to worry quite so much about their wellbeing.  I was wrong.  I taught my son to protect himself when he had sex but I never taught him what many parents teach their daughters today, how to protect himself from predators.

My son is 21.  6'5"".  He's a nice guy, a gentle soul.  In April he was downtown (a city of 300,000 or so) late one evening, riding his longboard.  He ran into some other guys on longboards who invited him back to a party they were heading to.  This was in an area where a lot of university students live.  

To make a long story short someone put something in his drink and raped him. It was at least one guy, maybe two.  He has vague memories but nothing specific.  He's a big guy so it's unlikely that whatever they use knocked him out completely, it just made him compliant.  He made it home but has no memory of how he got here.  He finally told me two months later when he found out he had Chlamydia.  His long term girlfriend thinks he cheated on her and has dumped him, he couldn't tell her the truth initially and when he did she didn't know what to believe.  She's understandably upset that he passed this infection to her.  He made a huge mistake not being up front with her and not taking precautions and he knows that now.  He's traumatized emotionally.  I feel like I completely failed him.  He's heading to the doctor this week to get tested for all the other STDs he may have contracted.  

I'm not writing this looking for sympathy, words can't fix this.  I'm sharing this experience in hopes that parents will teach their sons what I failed to teach mine.

I work as a server at a Chili's and tonight I had a table with a dad and a little boy (no older than six years old) and he was so well behaved and it was a pleasure serving the two of them. The little boy ordered his own food, said please and thank you, and was holding a conversation with his dad while waiting on his food (which is so freaking rare these days). The table next to them, however, had three screaming kids (and I'm talking like a three, five, and ten year old) who were rude, disruptive, running down the isles, and just making everyone else miserable while the parents sat there and did nothing. 

Since I am not legally allowed to ask the parents at the one table to start parenting and stop disrupting everyone else, I went to my table with the well-behaved kid and put a dessert on the table; the dad said ""I didn't order this."" And I said ""I know, its on me if you want it...I wanted to say thank you for being a great parent."" I then turned my head to his son and said ""And you are awesome!"" We high fived, I showed him a picture of my dog, and I felt like I did a really good thing because I remember when I was a kid, I was well-behaved and remember that the 'bad kids' always got the most attention because people were trying to shut them up. I just wanted to reward a good kid and a good dad.

Transitions were always an issue for my kids, as I'm sure they are for many kids.  I used to try to give them a heads up and that would help, ""okay, five more minutes...""

Another thing I would do is ask them to ""read my mind"".  

""Hey, Johnny, can you read my mind?  I am sending you a message with my mind... Do you know what I'm thinking?""  and I would concentrate.  

My kids would get this little smirk and say, ""yes, you are thinking it's time for bed.""   Then I'd make a big of show of ""oh wow, you are soooo smart, how did you know???"" etc etc.

They were usually pretty cooperative when I did this.  I think psychologically it helps when the suggestion comes from their mouths instead of mine.  They said it, not me! ;)

I advise you don't try this too often, it will definitely wear out.

Because this just happened.,rizzorat,412,147,402,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jojc8/ever_have_someone_humiliate_you_because_your/,"**TL;DR We got thrown out of a chocolate store because my three year old came in crying and cried for all of 30 seconds.**

Here's what happened in a Gertrude Hawk Chocolate store on Friday (this is my email to them):

*""Good morning.  I am writing to inform you of a very unfortunate incident that occurred in your Colonie Center (NY) store on Friday evening (August 2).  I have two small sons, a six year old (with Autism), and a 3 year old.  On Friday, my older son and I walked into the empty store and asked the clerk if there were any samples.  (My son loves routines and rituals.  Whenever we see one of your stores we HAVE TO do the following: ask for a sample, try it, then purchase a box of Smidgens or fruit slice jellies to use as positive behavior rewards for the boys).

I was asking after samples when my husband walked in with our younger son.  He (our 3 year old) was crying because he fell.

The employee asked, ""Are these your screaming kids?""  Embarrassed (and a little confused since only one child was crying), I apologized and turned to my hurt son.  She followed up with, ""If I give you extra samples, will you get them out of here?""  

I assumed that she was having a bad day, so I apologized again, and turned back to calm my son.  I had him quieted a moment later, when the clerk came over, said, ""Here!"", and shoved about a dozen chocolates hastily wrapped in a square of bubble wrap into my hands.  She then ordered us to leave the store - despite the fact that we had done nothing wrong, and both children were now quiet (the eldest having not been upset in the first place).

I smiled for the benefit of my children, and said, ""Seriously?""  She walked off and turned her back to us, and my husband and I left with our children.

It was humiliating.  

To compound the humiliation, I had to find a way to explain to my autistic son that we did not buy the Smidgens, or follow our routine, because we weren't welcome in that store.""*

My son, 18, was a ""junior"", at his bio-dad's insistence.  I have always hated the name and so has he. 

Especially since his father left when he was five and couldn't be bothered to be a part of his life anymore. 

On his 18th birthday he filed the paperwork to legally change his name.  Court was yesterday and it is now official. 

His former middle name is now his first name.  He took my middle name (unisex) &amp; the last name of my husband and I.  (my husband has been his dad for 12.5 years). 

 Now we (meaning I lol) have to start the process of  changing his drivers license, social security, voter registration, selective service record, FASFA, ACT records, high school before his diploma is printed, doctor records, bank account, health insurance, paycheck/employment, our life insurance policies he is beneficiary to, auto insurance...

There has been some outrage about [/r/preteen_girls](http://www.reddit.com/r/preteen_girls/), but obviously not enough. Actual child porn and discussion regarding sex with children are being posted -- my throat is tightening as I type this -- as well as ""legal"" content of kids eating bananas and such. The lowlife of a [moderator](http://www.reddit.com/user/tessorro), who was all about free speech, is trying to deactivate downvotes.

Here is how you can help:

* Someone officially [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/pkp74/requesting_the_banning_or_deletion_of_rpreteen/) deletion of the subreddit, comment in the thread and make your voice heard. You can also message Reddit top honcho, [Hueypriest](http://www.reddit.com/user/hueypriest) and tell him how you feel. 

* Go to the [New](http://www.reddit.com/r/preteen_girls/new/) section everyday and downvote all submissions to oblivion. For this, you need to go to Reddit's Preference menu and under Display options, uncheck ""allow reddits to show me custom styles"". 

* Feel free to post there and make their lives miserable. They say they have free speech, you sure as hell got yours.

***

**To the ""don't feed the trolls"" crowd:**

The usual mantra doesn't apply here because, if you take a long look, your reasoning is contradicted by facts.
When it received little publicity, jailbait thrived and ended up attracting major Web traffic. The CNN piece, and the outrage that followed in and outside of Reddit, brought it down.
Some subreddit were created after that, but their traffic is low. Hence, acting on it worked. Now we need one more push so that pedophiles do not view Reddit as a friendly place, and so that Reddit management realizes that we don't want this content here.

**Edit:**

This appears to be the first time he's done this. He's almost 11. We'd closed the door while he was doing homework because his younger brother was pestering him. What we're doing about it:

1. The computer is being moved to the common area. This was already on our agenda, we're just prioritizing it now.
2. An adult must be able to see what's on the screen whenever he uses it.
3. We're going to tell him that we're aware he used the computer for non-school purposes (at a time he was supposed to be doing homework) and that it was sexual in nature.
3. We're also going to explain why the internet is not a good source of information about sex. That most of what you find is not how two normal adults have sex and we want to make sure that he has good information.
4. Then we're going to let him know he can talk to us if he has questions, but also provide him with some books he can review on his own.

I don't want to put a lot of controls on the computer itself because I don't want him to start trying to figure out how to circumvent them.

As a disclaimer, I love the holidays and traditions that go along with it, but now that we have my family staying in my house for an extended period of time I'm bordering on insanity.  Why?  Two reasons:

1.  My 7 month old son's schedule has gone to shit because with all the extra noise and activity it's impossible for him to get a sustained nap or have some quiet play time where 6 different people aren't playing hot potato with him.  

2.  More irritating is the constant ""advice"" from extended family on how my wife and I are doing it wrong.  **WTF? **  Given, it's not the way they did it, but then again, he's our son.  

More specifically, we're not fans or practitioners of the ""Cry It Out"" method of getting a baby to sleep.  My mother and sisters are, and when they are in town it's always irritating because they make it known that they feel we're ""babying"" our baby by responding to his crying rather than letting him whimper himself to sleep.  Now I'm not sure what r/parenting's stance is on attachment parenting or cry it out, but when it comes down to it, it's really the parent's choice.  It burns my ass when other people judge us for not doing it the way they do (side note, my sister's kids are gremlins, never sleep, and are terrible at bed time because they know they're going to be locked in a dark room). 

**TL;DR: Don't come into my house and judge me or my wife on how we're raising our child.**

Like most parents, my sister has a hard time getting her 2 1/2 year old daughter to leave the room she is in when it is time for bed, or another activity. Especially when its time to go to bed. She noticed a peculiar thing.. 

If she turned the lights off in the room that her daughter was currently in and migrated into another room and turned the lights on, her daughter would leave the currently dark room and go into the room with lights, without causing a fuss. Like a moth to a light. Apparently it works so well, even if grandma is still in the dark room, she will leave the room and go into the well lit room without causing a huge fuss.. Obviously this will only work on a dark house.. 

Anyhow, I thought it was hilarious, and might come in handy for someone else. ;)


Edit: I find it very interesting that multiple parents have discovered this on their own. Looks to be a sound and recurring technique. Very cool!",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,1368384270.0,,,True,t3_1e6p14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1e6p14/the_moth_method_for_parents_of_23_year_olds/,

* I am not currently in any kind of relationship with her mother.
* I had to get a paternity test done for some administrative stuff, and I got back the most unexpected result.
* I've been there with her since the day she was born, and I've always provided for her and never suspected that she might not be mine.
* The mother knows who the father is, and he was made aware that she was pregnant almost 5 years ago.  No one else was ever told that another potential father even existed.
* I've been the one paying for her daycare and pretty much everything except her food.
* Her mom is flat broke.  She lives with her parents, she just had her car repossessed, and she finally got a job a couple months ago.
* I am an active duty Marine, and I live 7 hours away right now.
* I'm 23, mother is 22, daughter is 4.  

Edit:

* My name is on her birth certificate, and my home state is South Carolina in case we have any lawyers in the house.


Reddit, today I got the news that no father ever wants to hear.  I'm very confused about what I should do and who I should be talking to.  I've come to talk with my parents about everything, and they're standing behind any decision I make 100%.  I absolutely cannot abandon my little girl, especially with a person like her mother.  I want to retain my legal rights to visitation and anything else, and it was suggested that I seek legal guardianship. I really can't go forward with seeking adoption, and there's no chance of just ignoring this like it never happened.  I'm going to be setting up an appointment with an attorney, but I need to know what else I should be doing right now.  My family mentioned the possibility of fraud on her mother's part for never mentioning the other potential father, and even though I don't want to seek any damages directly against her, I would like to know if this is something I should be discussing. My whole world is literally in shambles, and I'm mentally and physically exhausted after a day of dealing with the shock.  


I need some advice on who I should be talking to, things I should NOT be doing, and basically just how to handle this whole situation emotionally.  I'm going to be seeking out a counselor next week when I return back to base, but in the mean time I could really use any advice that you have for me.  I'm probably going to pass out for the night after this, but I will clarify anything as soon as I can!

My wife and I need help.,AVeryWorriedDad,289,52,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1890pk/crossposted_from_askreddit_because_it_was_removed/,"Hi reddit. This may be in the wrong sub, I'm not sure but my wife and I need some advice.
We have a son who is in grade two right now. At the beginning of the school year, he began to ask us if it would be ok if we bought him pink bedsheets. yeah that's fine I said. I have pink dress shirts.
He then asked if he could go on playdates with some of his female school friends and again of course we didn't care.
About a month ago he asked us if we could buy him one of those poofy cupcake dresses (I don't know what it is called but it is usually colourful and looks poofy). He told us a girl at school had one and he liked it. I told him I wasn't sure
My wife said no that it was a bad idea because ""boys should wear jeans and play baseball"". I went out two weeks ago and bought him one. She was upset but seemed to get over it. We let him wear it around the house
Here is the problem now though. He wants to start wearing it to school and outside. I have no idea what to tell him. On one hand I know he is a young kid trying to figure out his sexuality, but on the other I don't want him to get picked on by other kids (we all know how cruel kids are).
What do you guys suggest? have I enabled my son too far and now will I screw him up if I don't let him wear the dress?
Thanks reddit.
P.s. My wife and I are not homophobes or anything we just don't want our kid to get beat up.

EDIT; Sorry I was away I took my wife and boy out for a lunch date and then I had to do some cleaning.

I do love my child but I hate being her mom. I would give anything to be childless again. My husband still wants three more children, more if none of them are boys. 

I had a ton of experience babysitting my niece in high school. Five hours every weekday and knew I disliked babies but everyone told me it's different with your own because you love them.  It isn't that different. My daughter is mellow and an easy baby but I still wish I had never had a child. 

I don't know what to do. I can't have more but my husband would be devastated. I'm already doing my daughter a grave disservice by being her reluctant mom.

Update: I'm feeling better knowing that the baby stage isn't fun for a lot of people. My baby and I had the car today and went out and came home to a clean house. It was a big chunk of what I needed. I was letting the threat of waves of future babies overshadow the cute one I have now. It's a relief not to feel locked down to a new baby every 2 years. Not saying that parenthood is what I was made to do but I think I can lovingly raise her into a responsible adult.

Thanks for the advice and minimal judgement.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,1367711588.0,,,True,t3_1dnpqq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1dnpqq/i_hate_being_a_mom/,

**You're probably wondering why we've asked you all here**

Greetings parents of reddit!  Following a [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/161q0s/meta_all_right_folks_can_we_outright_ban_cute/) our mod team has been having a lot of discussion, and we'd like to share our conclusions with you.

First a little background.  In general we've remained relatively hands-off and whiled away our time quietly removing spam submissions and enjoying the posts that the rest of you bring here.  /r/Parenting is, as we say in the sidebar, intended to be a mix of discussions, news articles, photos and blog posts related to having and raising children of any age.  We think of it as ""general interest parenting"" as opposed to other related subreddits that may highlight certain types of content more.  As such we've tried to make links to related subreddits prominent in our theme to help those who are interested in something more focused to learn about those resources.

So with a mostly laissez-faire moderation philosophy and a growing subreddit we've occasionally run into the same discussion that many other subreddits before us have encountered; ""Are certain types of posts beginning to overtake the content of the subreddit and driving out other types?""  In our case the most often-cited type of proliferating content is photos of your kids.  This post is neither intended to involve nor take a side in any debates about whether or not pictures of your kids are a good thing to share on reddit.  It's been obvious that some people like them and some people don't.  The fact that they are both popular and controversial is all the basis we need here.  This post is about moderation philosophy and the direction of the subreddit.

For those who ask the question of ""Why is moderation necessary at all?  Don't votes decide what is popular on reddit?"" we would point out a few things.  It's been pretty well established on reddit that there is a phenomenon (sometimes referred to as the ""fluff principle"") which essentially states that quickly evaluated and easy to digest content always has an unintended competitive advantage in the reddit voting system.  For more on this see the links at the end of the post.  Additionally there is always [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) which is accounted for in the [reddit FAQ answer to ""Why do we need moderation?""](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#WhydoesredditneedmoderationCantyoujustletthevotersdecide)

So given all of the above why hasn't anything been done previously moderation-wise about pictures of kids or image macros on /r/Parenting?  We've usually evaluated the state of things based on observations of the front page content of the subreddit (the top 25 post on /r/Parenting).  Typically the front page has reflected what we want to see: a mix of discussions, articles, and photos.  Although photos usually dominate the top 5 or so spots and garner a lot more upvotes than the rest of the front page (as predicted by the fluff principle), the image posts rarely occupy the majority of the front page, leaving ample space in the top 25 for some good articles and discussions as well.

But this is based on the assumption that everyone who reads /r/Parenting does so by directly visiting the subreddit, and that's just not the case.  In fact it's pretty likely that most who subscribe here only visit it directly once in a while and most of the time just see the posts that reach high enough on the subreddit to make it onto their combined front page.  This is supported by the face that we have 30k subscribers but [average less than 100 active users](http://stattit.com/r/parenting).  And because of how Reddit normalizes submission scores for combining subreddits to create a main front page, and the fact that image posts tend to get an order of magnitude higher vote totals than everything else, very little other than image posts make it from the front page of /r/Parenting to user's combined front page at reddit.com.  (This weekend being an exception because we temporarily enabled text-only mode due to some troll issues)

Therefore we have decided that it's time for a new policy for /r/Parenting to bring the mix of content here back to a better balance.

---

**Okay, so what are we doing?**

We are instituting ""Wallet Photo Wednesdays"".  Beginning this week (starting Monday) image posts will only be allowed on Wednesdays.  On all other days image submissions will be automatically removed by /u/AutoModerator (many thanks to reddit grand wizard /u/Deimorz).  We will also have /u/AutoModerator leave a message in removed posts to inform submitters of the policy and other options (such as waiting for the image day, posting in /r/ParentingLite or /r/CuteKids, or submitting a self post including a link to the image).  (Thank you /r/TwoXChromosomes for their ""Image Fest Fridays"" providing the inspiration)

We will aim to open up image posting late on Tuesday US time and close it down again either late Wednesday or early Thursday.

---

**TL:DR There are a lot of pictures and not much else showing up on the reddit front page for people who subscribe to /r/Parenting.  We are going to automatically remove images that are posted all but one day out of the week (Wallet Photo Wednesdays!) to encourage other types of content to get more exposure.  On other days consider submitting image posts to /r/ParentingLite or /r/CuteKids.**

Every time she finds a coin on the ground, she puts it in her purse, and when we get home we empty it into a big metal unicorn tin. She also gets them any time I pay for something with cash; she gets the 10c and 5c coins. 
Her grandparents do this, too.


I have never taken from this tin for spare cash, because it's all 5 cent pieces, and honestly...I could not be bothered counting out 5c pieces just to buy shampoo.

This tin has been growing full, and eventually overflowed, so we bought a metal Easter egg bucket two years ago, and she started adding to that.


Tonight I emptied both of them out while my husband was at the gym, and counted them out into $1 lots. I set aside the 50c and gold coins, they're not yet counted.


In *only* 5 cent pieces, the unicorn tin has over $35 in it. I stopped counting after that and just sorted them into lots of $1, then dumped them into a plastic bag.

Tomorrow I'm going to the bank after I pick her up from school, and we'll open a saver account in her name, and put every cent into it. I'm going to keep back $5 of it, and that can be hers to immediately spend on a special treat.


Now if I'd only been doing this myself for all the years before she was born, I'd be rich! *forehead slap*",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_1aa8nd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1aa8nd/always_collect_sidewalkpavement_coins/,

I was hoping you could offer advice on a situation which is not improving.  Our upstairs neighbours had a baby this spring.  We live in an old building where sound carries clearly, so when the baby cries, we hear it clearly.  It is constantly disrupting our sleep. During the summer, the parents would leave the windows open so it sounded like the baby was in our bedroom.  We politely asked them to close the windows but it wasn't until the building Super told them of other complaints that they did so.  It is now fall, the baby is older and her cries are louder.  Last night, she SCREAMED for over an hour starting at 3am.  It sounded like she was being boiled alive.  I guess she has an ear infection or  something.  We were driven out of our bedroom and ended up sitting in the living room watching TV until it was over.  If this happens on a weeknight and we have to work in the morning, I will be more than angry.  
How can I approach the parents and ask them to improve the sound baffling in the baby's bedroom so we can get a good night's sleep?

Edit: So basically all of you parents think someone else's choice to have a child is perfectly fine in causing a major disruption in my life. The couple upstairs moved in this spring, I've lived in my apartment for 10 years and am being told I should be the one to move, that I'm being an asshole for not wanting to be woken repeatedly in the middle of the night. So I'm the bad guy and the people who are negatively impacting my life have more rights than I do. Thank you all so very fucking much.  If I played the trumpet for an hour at 3am, I would be confronted about it in a second but due to the fact that it is a baby screaming/crying I'm just supposed to let it go? Fuck that. 

Edit edit:  Thank you to all the legitimate responders for your comments.  I realize my edit was jerky &amp; harsh and I'm sorry for it but will leave it there, both to show I was being a jerk and to show how sleep deprived I am that I can't handle internet trolls.  Sorry.

Well, I have a mentally disabled sister who will be turning 18 later this summer.  (She's a good decade + younger than me.)  Her ""label"" is technically ""MR"" (mentally retarded), although she can function at a high level and her maturity is equal to that of an 8-10 year old.

Anyway, I found out I was pregnant last year and I'm due in a few weeks.  For some unknown reason, she had a major meltdown over the news and said she was going to ""go get knocked up"" too.  We took it with a grain of salt and boiled it all down to her thinking it would get her attention...which it did for a short while.    

Now, for a little bit of back history before I continue:  She had been on the depo shot for a few years since she was unable to cope with having menstrual cycles.  She has pretty poor hygiene and is always battling UTIs and vaginal infections because she simply doesn't understand she needs to take very good care of that area...even though my Mom has showed her a thousand times what to do.  She also got in ""trouble"" with my Mom for having sex with another mentally challenged boy in the bathroom after school.  Nothing came of the situation, but my Mom knew she needed to keep a better eye on her.  One of my sister's friends, who doesn't have a mental disability, but who is still very, VERY immature has apparently been covering for my sister so she can go out and have sex with random guys.  (I believe under the guise that they're going shopping or having sleepovers, etc.)  This has just recently come to light and it seems as though it may be a little too late.

Anyway, there was a change in my sister's insurance recently and she was unable to get her depo shot for a 3-4 month period.  Meanwhile, she apparently started sleeping with random guys and older men she's been ""meeting"" online.  I am very much disgusted and saddened by this, but she really doesn't realize the consequences of her actions.  She has low self-esteem due to her disability and excessive weight issues and I feel she has started compensating by offering her body to men for the attention she so desperately craves.  

While I thought we had moved past her little freak out when we first announced my pregnancy, apparently things have taken a turn because a family member told her she needed to get used to not getting as much attention since there will be a new ""baby"" in the family.  This did not go over well with her, of course.  She knows the mechanics of how you get pregnant, but she certainly doesn't realize the consequences.  I also think the whole situation is propelled more by sexual gratification than actually trying to get pregnant.

So, she's currently at the doctor's office trying to sort things out.  She's going for STD testing in addition to the pregnancy test and I'm sitting here getting ready to faint/puke.  There's no way she can take care of a child because she simply cannot take care of herself.  I spoke with her briefly about the situation and she seems to think she can simply give the baby to one of her friends if they do find she is pregnant.  Completely unrealistic ideas...  I talked with her about abortion and she seemed to understand the concept and why it might be beneficial given her situation, but I fear my parents won't consent due to religious convictions.  I also don't know if she could realistically carry a child to term without killing either herself or the baby because she is in terrible health.  She is 5'2"" and weighs around 275 pounds and has hypertension, pre-diabetes and back problems due to her weight.  She clearly cannot take care of herself physically and all the attempts my parents have made to rectify and/or modify her unhealthy behaviors have failed.  You could tell her 100 times why eating certain foods are bad and then help her make good choices, but she'll literally throw a tantrum like a three year old and sometimes get violent when she doesn't get her way.  

Okay, so enough babbling.  I'm just at a loss.  From what I understand, it's likely that she *at least* has an STD or two.  That's not the end of the world.  But a baby?  I have no idea what to say.  I don't think she's in a position to carry the baby to term - in both a physical and mental capacity - but I have no idea how to get through to her (and possibly my parents) that bringing a baby into the mix would spell catastrophe for all involved.  I also feel guilty, although I know none of this is my fault.  She's always been jealous of me because I'm ""perfect"" and no matter how much I try to reason with her that we're simply ""different,"" it doesn't get through.  I'm sad and upset for her.  I'm disgusted other guys and men would take advantage of someone disabled.  It's just a crapshoot at this point.  If anyone has any advice or opinions, I'm all ears.

TL;DR:  My sister is a mentally disabled minor (17) who may be pregnant.  I feel guilty because she's upset about my pregnancy and I'm at a loss for what to do if she is pregnant.  She cannot take care of herself, let alone a child.  Advice and opinions needed.

**EDIT**:  I just spoke with my sister.  Fortunately, the pregnancy test came back negative.  However, the doctor is pretty sure she has chlamydia and isn't awaiting test results to start her on treatment.  There is also a decent chance that she's contracted genital herpes and they are waiting for the results.  Unfortunately, she has also been referred to an outside clinic for HIV testing.  It's come to light that she's had sex with over 10+ guys/""men"" in the last few months.  My Mom and doctor are discussing long-term contraception for the future, but that obviously doesn't help with the STDs she's contracting and likely spreading.  My parents will be visiting this weekend and I am going to speak to them about arranging outside authorities to take over her care once she turns 18.  If they are unwilling to consider these options, I may very well get in contact with social services myself.  Any advice on this process is appreciated.  

**EDIT 2**:  Holy cow!  Thanks for all the support.  I'm trying to reply to as many as comments as possible, but bear with me...there are a lot.  Talking through things has really helped me come to terms with the fact I absolutely need to get in contact with social services to work out something for her future long-term care.

**FINAL UPDATE**:  I spoke with my parents earlier this morning and here's where we are.  I was able to look through her Facebook messages (after piecing some information together with my parents - btw, they're both in the know at this point) and have found the ring leader in all of it.  Apparently, she somehow got in contact with a 22/23 year old guy who was just released from jail at the beginning of the month.  He convinced her to have sex with him (and according to her, three other guys - although there is no evidence to support that specific claim) and he admits (he's obviously not very bright to post this out in the open on Facebook) he was trying to get her pregnant because he wants another child.  He's basically put the last nail in his coffin because he admits knowing her age, yet still made very specific and explicit plans to have sex with her...he even admits to the act itself!  This is sick and probably TMI, but there is physical evidence as well.  He apparently gave her his shirt...which he, um, masturbated into after they had sex the first time.  Anyway, I took screenshots of the entire conversation - over 225 messages long - off of his Facebook wall and will be sending it to the police once my Dad contacts them.  

Surprisingly, my parents were very receptive to the idea of **further** involving social services in the future and they have asked that I find some resources and avenues for them to turn to over the next few months.  In the meantime, my sister is on complete lockdown and is not allowed to go anywhere besides school.  Her school counselor is aware of the situation and she will be escorted absolutely everywhere - even the bathroom - from now on to ensure she has someone monitoring her every move.  It sounds harsh, but that's what she needs.  As far as the contraception is concerned, my parents are seriously considering Mirena for its longevity.  We should know the results of her STD tests (herpes, HIV) by the end of the week.  She has started treatment for chlamydia.

I really want to thank everyone for their outpouring of support.  You have helped me through a very tough 24 hours and have given me lots to think about, as well as offered up tons of excellent advice.  You all rock!

A small, civil ceremony. We decided this long before Obama's announcement, but now there is a political firestorm around the topic, so I thought I would personalize this for those of you might feel disconnected from the issue so that you can choose to think about it, share the story with someone, or whatever. 

This Sunday will be the one year anniversary since our kids were placed with us. Three kids that were at high risk of not being adopted because: 
1) they were not infants 
2) there were three of them (Sibling groups are hard, these were already separated) 
3) they are black 
4) they were exposed to drugs in the womb and neglect/violence at home 

I've learned a tremendous amount about family over the last year. Especially about what a biological family vs an adopted or chosen family can mean. I've learned a lot about unconditionally loving someone. That includes continuing to love some members of my biological family despite their words of hate towards myself, my family, and my children. I have had the blessing to watch three of God's beautiful children blossom and heal from the hurt and neglect their biological families inflicted on them. And all of it is because we gave the kids something they lacked. A real loving family. One that they would not have without my partner and I. And for that reason we are legally being married to ensure that we have the same legal protections as any other family. If my child is in the hospital I don't need people asking us which one is the parent. If one of us passes away I don't want there to be a question of who will care for the kids future or have their be some struggle over the inheritance.

He is a good husband and a great provider for his family. He is very smart as well and speaks sarcasm fluently :-) He makes me laugh even when I don’t want to and I have really come to appreciate that with our hectic life. However, when it comes to relating/parenting our three young children, he falls very short. We often argue about whether or not he should talk to the children using sarcasm. He thinks its fine but I don’t because they don’t understand it and they think he is being a jerk. He doesn’t have conversations with them because he says he has a hard time understanding what they are saying. He rarely does anything with them (reading books, coloring, lego’s etc.) because he has a hard time relating to them. In turn, the kids come to me for EVERYTHING. I read to them, teach them, listen to them (and try to figure out what they are saying) and love them unconditionally. Don’t get me wrong, I know my husband loves his children and will gladly take a bullet for them but sometimes I don’t know if his love is unconditional. He has VERY high expectations of them. I often remind him that they aren’t born with knowing how to express their emotions without crying. Or knowing that things are dangerous. Its our jobs as parents to teach them. He yells at them (like getting up in their face yelling) when all he has to do is explain so they can understand. They do not know how to react around him. I am afraid to say that they might fear him. Actually, I know they do. Which is why they don’t like being around him. But then he is like a totally different person around me! We play COD together and laugh our asses off. He talks to me about these wonderful and interesting things that keep us talking to each other for hours. I love this man and I am happy I married him. Yet, I wonder if I am fucking up my children in the meantime. So parents of reddit, how do I get his “awsomeness” into his parenting?

Here are a few examples of some things he says:
“Honey, can you make lunch for the kids?”
“Man, fuck them” (again, joking but says it in front of them)

“Daddy, do you like my picture?”
“No”
(toddler walks away crying)

“Dad can I...(cant even finish sentence)
“No. Nothing you have to do is important” (again, joking)

“Daddy, guess what? I learned about Earth today”
“Wow, you must be some kind of genius then?”
(not in a lovingly way)

I just wanted to say thank you guys for all your help, and give you a little update. The day after posting, I talked to the mom about why the schedule needed to be put in place. I stressed what was going on, and that I might need to find other employment if it continued. She finally saw my side, and agreed that I could put a schedule and discipline into place. She even agreed to continue whatever I put into place when I'm not there, which was a huge step. I drew out a daily schedule, and put it on the fridge at his level. 


When he gets off the bus, he has until 3:30pm (when I get there), to do whatever he wants., but when I come through that door, it's homework time, and he has the option of having a snack. From four to five, he has an hour of free time, which is spent outside (weather permitting). Five to five thirty, dinner. (I know it seems early, but this way it doesn't interfere with his karate.) If he doesn't have karate, he has 5:30-6:30 for more free time. At 6:30, he writes a journal entry. What he did, how he's feeling, what happened during the day, etc. That way, he's a little more calm when we start getting ready for bed at 7. Then we have an hour for bathtime, prayers, and to read our Harry Potter chapter. 8pm is lights out. 


The schedule is working out great, and he LOVES going outside now. He begged me yesterday to push back dinner so we could spend more time out there! I also put into place a reinforcement system. Good deeds (following the schedule, helping with the dishes, etc) will give him one extra minute of indoor free time (and push bedtime back by one minute). Not following rules (running around the house, not turning off the Wii when I ask, ignoring people when they talk to him... etc.) will take five minutes of indoor free time (and put him to bed five minutes earlier). I also put into place a ""three strikes"" rule when we play the Wii. If he's shouting, or being violent with the equipment (he's competitive and gets frustrated easily), he gets two warnings, and the third time I shut off the TV, unplug the Wii, and put it on top of the fridge. 


The first day I input these rules, he thought I wasn't serious. His Wii got taken away and he went to bed a half hour early. Since then, he's been great. He follows the schedule, he ASKED me if the dishwasher needed emptying yesterday, and then proceeded to put away clean silverware without being asked. We lost a team game on the Wii yesterday, and he informed me that ""it's okay that we lost, 'cause we can do it again! Games are all about having fun, not winning!"" I was shocked, because this was a complete turn-around from last week!

It's not a cute story or a charming face palm moment or any other wacky hijinx. :(  My three year old son, my pride and joy, my soul, probably the only person I would die for -- was on my shoulders and he fell off.  Face first onto cement. Lost a bottom tooth. Required 5 stitches under his chin. 

Blood. Pouring out of his mouth. ""Daddy you dropped me!"". I've never heard him cry like that before. 

I'm so so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  

It was stupid. I hoisted him up like I have a million times before, released one arm to pick up a cup and bag of goldfish left behind in the Petco shopping cart, and, he lost his balance. Jerked one way and fell forward. I couldn't stop him. 

I don't think my wife will every fully trust me with our kids again. I don't trust me. 

Of course he won't take medicine.  He's three. He's starving because he hasn't eaten since the morning. He's tired because he was getting stitches during his scheduled nap time. He's in pain because he won't take medicine. He cant eat because he's in such pain.  He's an absolute emotional wreck because of all that. 

He's asleep now, but I wonder for how long. I anticipate another rough night (4 month old has croup and I've been up since 4)

We have a dentist appointment on Monday to assess the damage there. I'm going to try to sleep.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_tvdp5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/tvdp5/im_officially_a_bad_parent/,

This is the FIRST time he has EVER had anything done to besides routine check ups. He has always been a healthy boy, it's my oldest that has been through it all so I didn't feel the need to sit with him. 
My youngest was scared from before we even went and I wanted to be with him to make him feel better. I do understand why they have this policy however, now I do not want to ever take my children back to that dentist. 
Am I over reacting? Any other parents have similar experiences? How did you handle it?

1344948180.0,178,self.Parenting,y775a,"Is breastfeeding vs formula feeding a joint parenting decision? Or a ""my body, my choice"" issue?",Moshcrates,244,66,355,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/y775a/is_breastfeeding_vs_formula_feeding_a_joint/,"My daughter is 7 weeks old as of yesterday. My wife has been breastfeeding most of the time.  Some formula mixed in once in a while, not my choice, but my wife needed a break.  

At the beginning the breastfeeding was rough.  Hurt my wife a great deal.  She wanted to quit right away but I convinced her to stick with it as it would get better/easier.  Well I Was right and it did get much easier.  Now she's pumping more than enough to feed the baby, have some left over for later, AND freeze a couple ounces.  It is also completely pain free these days and the baby latches instantly. 

Last night she told me that she is done breast feeding because it is too stressful for her.  She also said she is going to stop breast feeding because ""she wants her boobs back"".

My response was : ""Ok I respect your decision, but that does not mean I have to agree with it, and I don't""

In order to back up her decision, she repeatedly told me that her friends (some of which are pregnant) as well as her female family members stop breastfeeding and their husbands didn't say anything. The actual quote was ""their husbands wouldn't dare question them"". To which my response was ""...ok...well then I Feel bad for those men who don't feel like they can voice their opinion in their own relationship and for their child"".  She was taking it as an insult that I would possibly disagree with her decision to stop breastfeeding.

Now I know this might get backlash but I feel like to stop breast feeding is a cop out. It's the ""easy way out"".  There has been some other instances where I have had to say to her ""Listen, raising a baby is not supposed to be easy."" when she gets upset because the kid won't go to sleep instantly, won't latch right away, or when she talks about getting her friends to come watch the kid so she can do her homework. 

We have different mentalities when it comes to raising the baby. For me, its not about inconvenience.  Whatever my daughter needs, that's what I do. Doesn't matter if it's hard. If it hurts. If it interrupts my life.  That's what I do.  I don't complain about how tired I am even with an hour of sleep. I don't complain about watching the baby when my wife wants to go out with her friends on the weekend to relax while I watch the baby.  That's just what has to be done.  That is life now.  The pre-baby life is over, and I feel like maybe my wife is stuck in that mode still.

Anyways, I OBVIOUSLY can't force her to breast feed the baby so she will make the final decision here. But I will not just say ""Ok that's fine with me"". I want the best of everything for my daughter.  Doctors and science (at least everything I have read) says that breastmilk is the optimal food for a baby. Not saying that formula is harmful in any way, but breastmilk is better.  Anything less than the best for my kid's health, makes me uneasy. Especially when there is really no life-threatening reason to stop breastfeeding. 

Am I just being overly controlling? Should I just blindly agree and backup my wife's decision without stating my opinion?

EDIT:  Just wanted to say thank you so much for all of the comments. I love hear everything from both sides of the coin on the issue. So many great perspectives brought up that I never thought of before. I am reading through all of the comments and plan to respond to every one. Thanks again. 

EDIT: Also just to clear a few matters up instead of repeating the same comments to questions posed: 

Night time feedings: I do get up and feed my daughter at night with the pumped milk store in the fridge.  My wife goes to bed around 9 or 10 with the baby, I go to bed around midnight. Wife feeds her at one and puts the baby back in the room with me while she sleeps in the guest room or on the couch because she has trouble  getting back to sleep. When the baby wakes up again at 4-5am, I get up, feed the baby, put her back to sleep, then get ready and go to work at around 7am when my wife comes back into the bedroom and continues sleeping until my daughter wakes again, often around 10am.  We worked out this situation weeks ago and it has been working GREAT for us.  

EDIT : Here is a picture of my daughter and I http://i.imgur.com/NPWe6.jpg
I would post one including my wife but I wouldn't want to do so without her permission

EDIT again: Talked to my wife today in the car on the way to a doctor appt. for my daughter.  Resolved a lot of what may have been misrepresented ideas last night. I explained exactly why I felt the way I did and she said she totally understood and probably could have worded the initial statement better.  I reassured her that I thought she was doing an amazing job as a mom, as well as saying that while I do not agree with her decision to stop BFing, I will back her up on whatever she thinks she needs to do. I think we came to a really good place and I started reading some of all of your quotes below which really made sense to both of us and I think allowed us to get where we are.

We played at the arcade, rode the merry-go-round a couple times, and headed for dinner.  Fairly soon after she sucked down about half of her apple juice, she needed to go potty.

As a male, it's stressful taking my daughter to the restroom.  We don't have as many stalls, the bathrooms are gross, etc.  Indeed, we walk in to a stall and find that someone has urinated all over the toilet seat.  I jump out to get us in to the next stall just as a kid (maybe 9?) walks in.  He hears me tell my daughter we'll have to wait, opens the door and says ""Do you guys need to use this stall?""  I tell him about the other stall, he says ""No problem, you use this one."" and goes in to the disgusting stall to do his thing, and leaves us the clean one.

Wow.

I saw him return to his table with his parents and I got my daughter from our seat and headed over to let them know what he had done.  I probably butchered my approach (definitely butchered it) but once I indicated how thankful I was and how great he was, they were over joyed.

I didn't want to offend by offering him some cash or a desert, so I hope I did him justice with the compliment to his parents and to him.  They're doing it right and have an awesome kid.

We live in a tiny apartment with a small, shared, unfenced yard.  I got to know a sweet little 13 year old from down the road when he came to me with a baby bird while I was talking on the phone on my porch one evening.  One of the neighbors had killed the parents with a bb gun and knocked the nest out of the tree.  He saved this one little bird, Sparky and he wanted it to live.  He was shirtless with the bird in a little nest of his shirt, crying. We gave it immediate attention and got it set up and then talked about how it needed to eat every 20 minutes from sun up to sun down, etc.  He asked if I would take care of it and I agreed.  Every day he would come over after school and hang out on the porch/yard and feed the bird and play mermaid with my kids.  He'd bring bugs and worms he found like child support.  His mom gave him permission to come inside one day when it was raining and then it ended up where he would come over and feed the bird but when it took naps he'd hang out inside and play music with the girls and talk to me while I made dinner.  We talked about science and canning and cooking and art and all kinds of things.  He is such a bright kid and goes to such a crap school.  We had this one incident where a neighbor woman from down the road ran up to us to use the phone, mouth swollen and holding her belly, then the boyfriend came up and starting hitting her, threatening me, picked her up and carried her into the alley.  I had him take the girls inside so they wouldn't see.  I called 911 and kicked his shins until he dropped her and we hid in my bathroom until the police came.  After, we talked about violence and measured response and social justice and community responsibility.  I'm not the best parent out there, I'm not the best person out there, but I try and I've been trying to share with him what he seems to crave.  He doesn't have a dad.  His mom works so so hard and is never home.  He sees her on Saturday afternoons.  That is literally it.  Other than that he talks to her on the phone.  He has other siblings older and younger and some random family that drifts through to care for them.  I don't really know the other kids, but he is pure gold.  I love having him around. I love his curiosity and his sweet little preteen embarrassing attempts to be cool.  But here is the thing.  He was here because of the bird.  Sparky, took very well to our treatment.  She learned to fly and hunt and socialize with other birds.  She is gone.  We see her from time to time and she will come sit on the balcony while I water plants in the morning, but that is it.  He hasn't seen her in 2 weeks.  He comes by occasionally, but seems like he doesn't feel he has a reason to stay.  I don't know that I have a reason to invite him to stay.  He just left from ringing my doorbell during nap time to ask if I'd seen the bird.  We talked for a minute and then it was kind of awkward and he seemed to feel like he had to leave.  Here is the deal.  After the first week, he wasn't coming over for the bird.  He was coming over to set the table and tend the garden and play my little pony with adoring kids and have an adult spend some time on him.  I know that.  Is there a way to continue some kind of relationship with this little guy?  Should I even?  This is a kid that I was 'warned' about saying that he was a hoodlem and to watch my stuff.  (He wanders around alone a lot and plays basketball in the alley and ends up in peoples yards rearranging their garden stuff so he can draw it, but I don't really mind that crap.)  So none of the other adults in the neighborhood are really talking with him.  The kids all think he's weird because he still digs for worms and stuff.  They don't realize that he's doing some awesome informal research with what he finds at the library.  I've been this kid.  Alone and adrift.  But things have changed since I've been 13.  What do you guys think?  Is it ok to try to stay in his life?  Should I try contacting his mother and seeing if he'd like to go to the zoo or something with my family one day now that summer is here?  The whole thing is awkward and so am I.

It was his fourth restaurant visit and he's only been cranky on one of them and I think that was because he was just getting over the croup. Before he was born I was pretty set about not taking him to restaurants because I have been to a few where someone's kid was yelling and screaming ruined the whole experience and made me just want to rush out of there.

As we were leaving we noticed the couple behind us were leaving too so I waited a little bit so we didn't bump into each other getting our things together. Then out of the blue the guy comes over and says something like ""You guys are doing a great job. You have one happy and nice young boy right there. Please take this. Your next coffee is on me!"" (he must have noticed I just went through about 6 cups while sitting there) He then does the slide money into my hand via a handshake thing and gives me $5. I was pretty shocked at this and wasn't quite sure what to do, so I thanked him for his compliments and gift, but it really wasn't necessary since we were happy to get out and just spend some quality time with our boy. He insisted we take it and I didn't want to push the issue and it turning the kind gesture into an argument so I said thanks again and kept the money. 

We put the money in our son's piggy bank and told him he can buy a toy with it later since he earned it for being so good.

**TL;DR:** Our son was good and didn't scream in a restaurant and someone gave me $5 for it.

Then, with a very serious look on her face:

""Daddy fix Caillou.""

I wasn't sure what she meant, so I went into her room where her Caillou DVD had been playing (I'd turned it on when she woke up from her nap) and it had played through all the episodes and returned to the main menu. She said again ""Daddy fix Caillou.""

My daughter paid me $.47 to press play on her DVD player.

Is this a sign that 'rewards' are a viable teaching tool, now? ""If you do this, you get this!"" Or was she just emulating what she's seen daddy do?

I'm a single dad. I have 3 kids (Boys are 5yo, 3yo, daughter is 18mo). All to the same mum. I have custody of our 2 boys and she has our daughter. 3 months ago, my ex and I had an argument after I asked her why she told someone I had a speech impediment. When she denied she ever said it, and I presented proof, she then told me to never contact her again and she will ensure that it would happen. The next day, I was served with an Intervention Order against her and my daughter. Claiming that I abused them both physically. I was not allowed to see my daughter during this time. 

A month later, we went to court and after I told my lawyer to instruct my ex and the magistrate that I intended to fight this tooth &amp; nail, the magistrate withdrew the AVO lodged on my daughter but still kept the one for her mum. I thought I would be allowed to see my daughter again, I was wrong

A month after that, I went to court again for the final hearing of the AVO against the ex. She never showed up so was withdrawn right away. I live 2 hours from court so each time I have spent 4 hours driving and $70 in fuel. Ofcourse, during all of this, she did not express any concerns to the police about our boys living with me, and she still saw them every second weekend.

It's now 3 months since I've seen my daughter. Her mum has never given me her number, we talk via email only, and none of my requests to see my daughter over the last 3 months have been answered. She's been living with her boyfriend since a week after we broke up, and while I've initiated court proceedings. It can take up to 15 months to get anywhere (Victoria, AUstralia).

I am so afraid that my daughter no longer knows who I am, and the ex is vindictive enough to not mention me at all to our daughter, instead using her boyfriend as ""dad"", which she has claimed previously. I'm scared the damage is done. When I do eventually get to see her again, be it next month or in 15 months, when she is nearly 3 years old, she will not see me as dad, just a stranger that all of a sudden she has to spend time with. 

All day today, when I realized this, I just broke down. I cried. A lot. It hurts so much and there isn't anything I can do. My boys saw me crying today and I can't tell them a single thing about it. Now, their mum has also stopped seeing them also and they have been asking me why. I can't do anything but explain to them that mummy loves them but is currently very busy. The stress of all this is tearing me apart and I don't know where else to turn or what else to do, all the while, I'm just feeling myself get worse and worse.

:'(

They each had a few questions and they all seemed to understand and support you. I totaled all the money that my friends had donated and they came up with $225!

1366820409.0,160,self.Parenting,1d0mtv,"At 4.5 months pregnant, my wife and I were told that our daughter had spina bifida among other issues and we chose not to continue the pregnancy. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.",throwaway42413,208,48,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1d0mtv/at_45_months_pregnant_my_wife_and_i_were_told/,"I have gone back and forth about posting this but I want to provide some insight to anyone who may be curious or in a similar situation.

Here's a bit of background:

My wife and I already have a 2.5-year-old daughter who is perfectly healthy and generally awesome in every way.  We decided to get pregnant again and everything was going along fine (aside from the never-ending nausea for my poor wife) until she got a high MSAFP reading on a blood test.  We were concerned but my wife is always borderline for gestational diabetes, so I was hoping it was just another false positive.  We did a ton of research on that protein test and spina bifida just to be as knowledgeable as possible for when we returned to the doctor.

When we went in for a follow-up ultrasound, the sonogram tech went to great detail to show us the baby's face, show her wiping her eyes, kicking, etc.  We thought that was a sign that everything was fine.  Obviously, that made it so much more painful when we learned the truth.

We went to a genetics counselor who told us that the baby exhibited the [lemon sign](http://radiology.rsna.org/content/228/1/206.full) and the [banana sign](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/banana_sign) which both pointed to spina bifida.  We discussed the options - continuing the pregnancy and seeing how the baby developed further, conducting surgery which would have likely been out of state and at great risk to my wife and the baby, or terminating the pregnancy.  The counselor set up an appointment for another sonogram for two days later.  

After grieving and discussing the options, my wife and I also asked that the termination appointment be scheduled following the second ultrasound so we wouldn't have to wait any longer.  

The day between the first and second ultrasound was one of the longest of my life.  I was very hopeful that they would find nothing and we could have the baby but I always had the idea that would not be the case in the back of my mind.  In the second ultrasound, my wife and I both cried quietly as we saw the baby moving around while the doctor identified the hole in the spine and the brain formation issues.  

We continued with the termination the following day.  It was scheduled at Planned Parenthood because our insurance company does not have the staff for the procedure.  We were met by protestors who made the day that much more difficult.  Planned Parenthood was quick and effective but it was a cold, sterile environment.  The staff was very tender but it would have been so much more comforting to be in our own hospital.  

Anyway, that's what happened.  Please feel free to ask any questions you may have about anything we experienced.  

I just ask that you hold back from judging me in the context of your personal morals or religion.  I can tell you that this is the most difficult decision I have ever made and it was not made quickly or without significant forethought.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_1d0mtv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1d0mtv/at_45_months_pregnant_my_wife_and_i_were_told/,

Now that our littlest is 6 months old I'm finding that a lot of that negativity is/was a little overblown and that there are so many mind-blowing joys of having more children that nobody really ever mentioned.

For example: The way my two girls respond to each other, how eldest is ridiculously excited to see her little sister each morning, and how youngest just lights up when her big sister crouches down to chat. This morning they got caught in a giggle-loop where eldest started giggling apropos of nothing, and littlest found this the funniest thing in the world, which eldest in turn found the funniest thing in the world, and the room was bubbling with laughter for a good ten minutes.

Please help.,private_throwaway_,209,56,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/19kz8n/11_year_old_daughter_is_watching_goredeath_videos/,"Throwaway because I haven't told my wife yet, and I'm not sure how to begin that conversation just yet.

We have a PC in a room beside the kitchen which she uses and from time to time I check the history, to make sure nothing crazy is going on. So far nothing too weird of wild apart from this. Apparently for the last 2 weeks she has been visiting death and gore sites like mentalzero.com and documentingreality.com. If you're brave enough to look you can get an idea of what I'm talking about, it's really gruesome stuff.

I haven't noticed any changes in her behavior, usually she's pretty happy and does well in school. I'm pretty honest with her and we've had awkward conversations in the past which went well but I don't know how to approach this. I'm kind of worried this could be her developing into a psychopath perhaps. Generally she doesn't get a lot of exposure to violent media, probably the worst films she has watched would be stuff like twilight and batman but the vast majority of stuff she watches is pretty much age appropriate. The most violent video games I have seen her play are tower defense flash games or simple flash zombie survival games.

She is kind of an oddball sometimes I guess but I feel like this is something I should be worried about.

I don't know if anyone here has been through anything similar but it's kind of freaking me out. I was probably late teens at least before I saw my first picture of a dead body or extreme gore.

What do I tell her? I mean it's not wrong, but getting desensitized to that stuff while she's still a kid, it honestly freaks me out a little.",,False,self,t5_2qhn3,False,,,True,t3_19kz8n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/19kz8n/11_year_old_daughter_is_watching_goredeath_videos/,

My biggest takeaway from that time was this: watch young children (particularly toddlers) like a hawk!  

I was a lifeguard for 4 seasons, and during that time, I was in the water 4-5 times to assist people four years old or older.  I had probably hundreds of ""scoops"" as my friends and I termed them.  A scoop was a quick dash to the water's edge, where you would pick a kid up, and place them back on their feet.  Often, the parents would be very close by, unaware that their kids were in trouble, because they didn't recognize the signs. I don't blame the parents; they didn't have the training/experience to spot what was happening.

Contrary to what you see in movies, drowning people, particularly children, do not flail madly, they make hardly any commotion at all.  A young child (2-3 years old) can drown in mere inches of water.  A young child will essentially lie face down in the water while they're in serious distress. Kids that young are often not super-steady on their feet; it will never occur to them to simply stand up and save themselves.  

These kids are particularly vulnerable when there is something interesting either overhead (a blimp, plane with a banner, fireworks) or on the beach to watch.  They'll look away from the waves, and will be knocked down and into danger in seconds.

Hopefully this is useful to someone.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/puhhl/becoming_a_parent_has_ruined_my_life/)
  
Almost immediately after my previous posting, things started to improve. This was a combination of making a few changes, and the baby turning a corner. 
  
Previously, I talked about how everything I'd once valued in my life had pretty much turned to garbage, and I figure I should do a bit to review what changed and how things improved. 
  
**My social life:** *just fine*. My wife was not into the idea of giving each other ""days off"", as some posters had recommended, but we did figure out a system. My wife and baby go to bed very early, and, if I go out on a Saturday night, so long as I get back reasonably early on Sunday morning, my absence is hardly noticed. The key factor in this is that caring for the baby has gotten much less strenuous. I can go to a friends house for the night, and have confidence that my wife and child are having a fine time without me. 
  
**My sex life:** *revived*. Not long after my last post, my wife and I adopted a strategy where we agreed that we weren't even going to try to have sex for 2 weeks. This was far less frustrating than the cycle of failed attempts and disappointment. Looking back, there was certainly an element of sheer sexual frustration, but what I really missed was the intimacy. One problem, aside from the exhaustion, was that we'd both sort of withdrawn emotionally. We'd basically become co-workers, and we were both so stressed out and preoccupied, it was like we'd hardly seen each other. Eventually we put out brave faces aside and had sort of a postmortem on the first three months. Once we'd gotten some things off of our chests and emotionally reconnected, and ever since the two weeks were *almost* up, it's been all lovey dovey. 

**My finances:** *improving*. I've still got my day job, but I've started a side venture which should start to bring in some extra money by the summer, and I've taken a bit of contract work. There's still much work to be done, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to stay in the black.
  
**My health:** *eh, still surviving*. The baby is sleeping much better, but I'm still burning the candle at both ends. But, not being so stressed out, I'm not feeling quite so run down as before. 
  
**My career:** *improving*. I'm not breaking any productivity records, but I'm feeling a lot better about the amount of work I've been getting done. 
  
Some little things have helped, but the main thing that's changed is the baby. None of the good stuff that's happened would've been possible if he hadn't drastically reduced his demands on our time and energy. For instance, he used to need to be walked and/or bounced almost constantly. Now you can set him down for 15 minutes at a time, and he'll just sit there jabbering to himself. It's adorable. Also, he hasn't been going into ""inconsolable mode"" as often or as severely. There were times before where, no matter what you did, the best you could do was to get him to cry less hard, and futilely trying to console a child is just soul crushing. We'd get stuck in these epic struggles trying to get him to fall asleep, and after an hour or two of that, we'd be just psychically and emotionally worked. Even better is that we've learned a couple ways to make him laugh, and it's a blast. We'll have half an hour of laughing and playing with the baby, and it's wonderful. Overall, caring for him is more fun and less strenuous, and that makes all the difference.
  
Thanks again for all the advice and encouragement from before. I just wanted to let everyone know that things did indeed get better.
