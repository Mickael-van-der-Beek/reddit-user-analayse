[Read it in full here](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-imageboard-pics-study/).** 
--

After President Obama’s historic campaign stop on Reddit, the Daily Dot claimed the social news site is “becoming the world’s largest image forum, where famous people occasionally come to promote themselves.”

Now there’s a study that backs up that assertion.

On March 12, Michigan State University graduate research assistant Randy Olson, with help from longtime redditor Chad Birch, revealed a series of graphs that documented the history of the Internet's self-proclaimed front page.

The graphs detailed the rise—and decline—of the site’s many nooks and crannies as proven by user submissions. By 2009, content-specific subreddits, which increased on an annual basis, managed to eclipse the content posted to r/reddit.com, the site's longtime miscellany subreddit. In 2011, r/reddit.com was permanently closed.

These days, r/funny sees the majority of the site's submissions, followed closely by r/AdviceAnimals, r/askreddit, and r/pics. With the exception of r/askreddit, the top subreddits are driven by image-based submissions.

1351106906.0,23,self.dailydot,120t4x,There's a subreddit for that: Campaigning for toaster freedom at r/ToasterRights,kmmokai,29,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/120t4x/theres_a_subreddit_for_that_campaigning_for/,"*Mike Fenn is a contributing writer at the Daily Dot and a man with a mission: Profile every damn subreddit in existence, from /r/turtle to /r/TurtleTonguePorn, from /r/pyongyang to /r/pyongyangbannedme. In today's installment, Mike delves into the world of online appliance activism: Meet /r/ToasterRights, where every toaster has its say, and giraffes are always put in their proper place.*

This election season, the campaigns between President Obama and challenger Mitt Romney have touched upon many topics: the economy, healthcare, Big Bird. While these issues are of sizable importance to
people and [felt puppets](http://www.dailydot.com/news/million-puppet-march-big-bird-public-media/) everywhere, there is still nothing whatsoever being done about the rights of toasters.

You might view your toaster as nothing more than a device that crispens a few slices of bread for your breakfast each morning. Its feelings, desires, and even history are of little, if any, importance to you. Sadly, such ignorance has allowed these beloved kitchen staples to make it all the way to the 21st century without even the most basic rights that you take for granted.

Fortunately, [r/toasterrights](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/), a [surprisingly popular](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/comments/xzhul/were_now_recognised_as_a_popular_community_thanks/) subreddit, has been created to raise awareness of the injustices being experienced by toasters everywhere. Thanks to redditor [THE_HUMAN_TREE](http://www.reddit.com/user/THE_HUMAN_TREE), the devices finally have a voice.

“This subreddit was originally created (by me) to grant toasters the right of gay marriage, but I then realized that we had a lot of way to go before something of that volume could even hope of being accomplished,” THE_HUMAN_TREE explained to the Daily Dot. “Toasters are underappreciated. Blenders and ovens are commodities, while toasters are being shoved out of the spotlight.”

Fellow moderator [nicksatdown](http://www.reddit.com/user/nicksatdown) believes that toasters are not only being ignored, but that they also suffer regular abuse.

“They have been mistreated for years,” he stated. “Blenders and ovens get all the attention, toasters are tossed after a few years, treated like garbage. We are here to spread awareness of the misuse and abuse!”

It wasn’t always so bad for toasters. As recently as 20 years ago, things were a lot different.

“Twenty years ago they were treated like Apple products are today. Fresh metal painted bodies. Respect,” nicksatdown said.

THE_HUMAN_TREE agrees.

&gt;“Twenty years ago, toasters were living the high life. They were
revolutionary in the appliance industry, the gold standard.”

Unfortunately, as kitchen appliances became more plentiful and advanced, toasters became more and more overlooked. Refrigerators can now make ice and broadcast television. Microwaves can be used not only for cooking, but also as a clock or timer. While the versatility and efficiency that these appliances have enjoyed is commendable, their main purposes tend to get lost in the confusion. Toasters, while appearing simple, lack this setback.

“It has one job, but it does that job very well,” THE_HUMAN_TREE said. “The toaster is the most effective way to heat/toast a piece of bread.”

With over 1,600 subscribers, r/toasterrights, which has been [deemed a ""popular community""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/comments/xzhul/were_now_recognised_as_a_popular_community_thanks/),
has no shortage of support. One thread focuses on the topic of anti-toaster [bullying](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/comments/xoail/paste_this_on_the_walls_of_every_school_and/). Another invites discussion on the issues faced by[ female toasters](http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/comments/10sdmj/apparently_the_brave_little_toaster_wasis_a_girl/).

“Even though toasters’ rights have come a far way in the last 20 years, female toasters really haven't seen that same advancement,” moderator [Apostolate](http://www.reddit.com/user/Apostolate) said.

Election Day is nearing. You will soon step into the voting booth and help decide the fate of your fellow citizens. While this is going on, the device that made your English muffin nice and crispy before you left the house sits ignored on your kitchen counter. It not only doesn’t get to vote, but it also sees no benefits from your own action
at the polls.

It doesn’t have to be this way, though.

If you are a champion of the advancement of toasters everywhere, r/toasterrights welcomes your support, stories, and ideas. Should you decide to join and become a “toaster activist,” it is requested that you keep toaster pictures SFW (that is, with a case on) and that you denounce microwaves, the toaster’s mortal enemy.",,False,,t5_2so3f,1351107367.0,,,True,t3_120t4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/120t4x/theres_a_subreddit_for_that_campaigning_for/,

Redditor TrollingThunder [exposed](http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/p0p0m/solinvictus/) Cheong in a [/r/reportthespammers](/r/reportthespammers) about two months ago, but Reddit admins didn’t ban him until last weekend. Cheong, editor of gaming site [Gameranx](http://www.gameranx.com), frequently promoted his own content on this site, and also seemed to heavily promote content from a select few additional sites. His relationship to those companies remains murky.

No one should be surprised someone like Cheong posts his own stories to Reddit (I occasionally post my own articles, for instance). It’s not against the rules. What makes Cheong’s case unique is that he’d managed to push his way into a moderator role at some of Reddit’s most trafficked communities, including [/r/wtf](/r/wtf) and [/r/politics](/r/politics), positions that allowed him to avoid Reddit’s spam filter entirely. 

For his part, Cheong said he never broke the rules.

“I've never used my position as a moderator to avoid the spam filter,” he told me in an email. “Nothing I submitted was against the rules in terms of content, and the filter is in place to kill unrelated content.”

He added: “Personally, I don't see why it's as big a deal as it is because voters posts on reddit become popular based on their content. If content is good, then it gets to the front page. Personally, I never used any voting rings or alternate accounts to promote my links.”

Yishan Wong has been a redditor for five years. But he’s spent most of his commenting energy recently at question site [Quora](http://www.quora.com). There, he led a popular uprising, of sorts, against the site’s most basic commenting rule: “Be nice.” 

“One dictionary definition of ‘nice’” Wong [began](http://www.quora.com/Yishan-Wong/Posts-by-Yishan/Be-Nice-Rule-Considered-Harmful) in his excoriating post from Sep. 9, 2011, “is ‘pleasing, agreeable, or amiable.’ These things are not conducive to serious and civil discussion, or an effective search for the truth. In fact, it is actively harmful and one of the most perniciously destructive.”

He continued in [a follow-up post](http://www.quora.com/Yishan-Wong/Posts-by-Yishan/More-About-Be-Nice-And-Why-Its-Bad):

&gt;The discussion of controversial topics cannot happen if there is a requirement to be nice. Controversial topics are controversial because they make people uncomfortable. They are intrinsically neither pleasing nor agreeable. In fact, they are unpleasant and disagreeable. Sorting them out, or at least elucidating truths from the hot emotions that surround them requires a willingness to plunge into the unpleasantness and disagreements. Being nice stands in the way of that.

Wong suggested turning the rule to “be civil” or “be respectful.” Beyond that, he figured “be nice” was best left to an informal rule set: an etiquette system, “e.g. reddiquette,” he suggested, presciently. 

From his [comments yesterday](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/03/new-reddit-ceo-reporting-for-duty.html), we know very little about what Wong intends to do differently at Reddit. He even said he’s “not looking to implement any ‘big, bold new directions’ or redesigns.” 

But from his Quora campaign, it’s pretty clear that Wong gets Reddit. He understands the site’s biggest strength is that gives its users the power to control content and discourse. There are very few rules on Reddit. And there’s certainly no requirement to be nice.

Anyways, someone else [has written a review](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditReviews/comments/ylbbf/audience_chambers_my_liege/c60lvfq) for this sub and before I edit and publish it, I'd like to read some of your opinions of their review.

To that end, please leave some thoughts in each of the following categories: **Content**, **Community**, **Moderatorship**; please write your comments under the appropriate heading so it's easier for me to compile the comments and include them in the final post in the appropriate fields.

***

If you are having some troubles coming up with things to say about the categories, I have come up with a bunch of fairly straightforward questions you could answer about each category:

Submissions:

On the scale of /r/atheism to umm..../r/yourfavoritesubhere I guess, how on-topic, appropriate and interesting is an average submission? How highly does the quality differ on /new vs front paged submissions? What kinds of things are usually submitted--pictures/videos or a lot of self texts or is it usually very varied? How good is the average submission title at describing the contents of the submission? How many submissions are there per day on average?

Community:


Are there people who frequent the sub whose usernames you would recognize? How many (a lot/some/a fairly good amount/etc.)? Do people get aggressive/overzealous with downvotes? Is there a lot of fighting/aggressiveness in the comments or is it usually a fairly polite area? On the scale of /r/atheism to /r/askscience, how frequent are off-topic comments, pun threads and one-word comments?

Moderatorship:

How active are the mods on this subreddit and on reddit in general? How often do they leave undistinguished comments on the various links and self posts here? How often do they submit content?  How well-written and understandable is the sidebar? Do you like the CSS?

How ban-happy are the mods? Have there been instances when you felt a comment was removed unfairly? On the scale of /r/lgbt to /r/askscience, how good are the mods at respecting the wishes of their community? How often are submissions removed?

***

* Speaking of casual activism, redditors have found a cause created just for them: KSCO, a Santa Cruz radio station, is willing to take Rush Limbaugh off the air.

(Sorry, [/r/subredditdrama](/r/subredditdrama) fans.)

There were other Reddit rumblings, however.

There’s been a long-running fight between subscribers of [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) and its moderators. Many users have fled the subreddit for a new competitor, [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow). Those redditors believe that the mods at r/LGBT are abusive and censor dissent. The fact that the conflict has a strong connection to the folks at [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays), the subject of most Reddit-conspiracy theories nowadays, doesn’t much help.

That conflict went Reddit-mainstream on Thursday with a [front-page post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qa6zg/whats_the_best_way_to_call_the_admins_attention/) on r/askreddit. The question: What can users do about abusive moderators?

It’s a question that comes up time and again on Reddit, and the answer is always the same: nothing. Make a new community, and hope it works. But when I wrote about this earlier this week, I was [reminded by a reader](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/qb9jh/reddit_digest_wednesday_22912_growing_up_amish/) about the [/r/republicofreddit](/r/republicofreddit). 

That experimental network of subreddits hosts regular moderator elections. It’s grown slowly since it launched last October. It’s biggest sell over time is its smarter and more flexible political structure. 

Redditors unhappy with Reddit’s normal power structure [ought to give it a look](http://www.reddit.com/r/republicofreddit).

This week on Reddit didn’t fit into any thematic boxes. It was, however, a great week for AMAs.

From a guy who got [hit by lighting](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbfvr/ama_someone_who_was_struck_by_lightning/) and [MIT nuclear scientists](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qdbxg/askscience_ama_series_we_are_nuclear_fusion/) to a man who [grew up Amish](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qagzg/with_all_the_attention_the_ggamish_meme_is/), it was a weird and esoterically educational week at [/r/iama](/r/iama).

Of course, we can’t forget that astrophysicist and educator Neil deGrasse Tyson, possibly the most popular man on Reddit, completed [the third in his trilogy of AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/) on Thursday. The answers this time were as good as ever, and, for one, Tyson switched to his motivational-mode: 

&gt;The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.

The change was implemented poorly and without warning (some of the subreddit’s moderators didn’t even know about it), and the minor Reddit riot it spawned speaks to a bigger issue facing the site: the default subreddit system just doesn’t work.

In case you’re not aware, Reddit’s defaults are the 20 or so subreddits every user subscribes to when they register. None of the subreddits are officially run by Reddit staff: they’re all essentially owned and managed by volunteer moderators.

At r/askreddit, those mods have become increasingly tired of off-topic or rule-breaking posts. So one of the mods implemented a tagging system that added a note to offending posts, essentially tips pointing to subreddits where the question might be more appropriate. 

Users didn’t like it because the tags were, frankly, obnoxious (“Does the mod on the clock right now realize the tags they're putting on posts is even more irritating than the post they tagged?” nerdscallmeageek [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scrp4/does_the_mod_on_the_clock_right_now_realize_the/)). Many still also believe downvotes are the best system for controlling content (something that clearly isn’t working, based on the types of questions that shoot up r/askreddit’s front page).

In this case, very much to their credit, the r/askreddit mods respected the community’s reaction, and [shelved the tagging system](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sd9cz/mod_post_link_flair_has_been_disabled_for_now/). 

But what if they didn’t? The conflict highlighted once again the problem with reddit’s default system. When users don’t like the way a subreddit is run, the usual refrain is a variation of what r/askreddit mod andrewsmith1986 [told](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scrp4/does_the_mod_on_the_clock_right_now_realize_the/c4d11cn) that subreddit’s angry commenters on Monday: “Subreddits are kingdoms and you can start your own whenever you want but do not pretend that anything is owed to you.” 

But because every new reddit account is automatically subscribed to the defaults, and because the subreddit discovery system is so terrible, you can’t really just “start your own whenever you want.” Moderators and users are pretty much stuck with each other. 

This became a topic for debate at [r/theoryofreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sg6vs/crosspost_heckytorrs_excellent_post_on_the/) and [r/ideasfortheadmins](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/sdn32/create_reddit_commons/) later in the week, thanks to this popular [comment from redditor Heckytorr](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/sdn32/create_reddit_commons/c4dcfl9) (click through to read the full comment):

&gt;There needs to be a mechanism by which reddits (particularly default ones) have viable substitutes/competitors that ensures that the mod's behaviour is reflective of the desires of the community. Currently the main reddits are granted the pretty much unconditional status of being default, which undermines the whole idea of a 'market' of reddits.

Reddit staffer Keith Mitchell [jumped in](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sg6vs/crosspost_heckytorrs_excellent_post_on_the/c4dx21z) to the r/theoryofreddit thread, asking for and getting advice—a big hint that Reddit staff are taking the problem seriously. But let’s hope they come up with a solution—soon.

There is absolutely no way to get it to do what you want, so you can't really manage or control it, you are mostly just trying to set up ways for all the bees be happy … And if they are happy, sometimes they will make honey, and everyone seems to like that (e.g. positive change for the world, charity drives, etc).
&gt;Occasionally something will piss off the bees (sometimes it's something you do, or something someone else does) and they will swarm around and sting you. You really can't do anything about it, but also the swarm eventually goes away.
&gt;And like beekeepers, you just need to be wearing decent protection, or have a thick skin. I grew up in the internet age of trolling and flaming, so it's pretty okay for me.

SolInvictus, it turned out, was Ian Miles Cheong, [a paid social media consultant for international news site GlobalPost](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-hire-spam-ian-miles-cheong-sollnvictus/). Slaterhearst, [as I reported earlier this week](http://www.dailydot.com/society/atlantic-slaterhearst-jared-keller-reddit/), was actually The Atlantic’s social media editor Jared Keller, who spammed Reddit with thousands of links to Atlantic Media sites over the course of a year and likely brought millions of new visitors to the company.

(Interestingly, [cah75](http://www.reddit.com/user/cah75), another account that frequently linked to Atlantic stories, was also banned recently).

Reddit’s democratic system makes it easy for spammers like this to justify what they’re doing: Submissions are only successful once they hit that critical mass upvotes. So long as there isn’t any vote-rigging going on, are these spammers really hurting Reddit?

Reddit's general manager Erik Martin, in fact, suggested to me that Reddit takes vote-rigging far more seriously than traditional spam-by-volume people like Keller. So then why ban Keller and Cheong, and why have such a strict policy about self-promotion in the first place? It’s possible the two were involved in vote-rigging. There’s absolutely zero evidence to prove this, however, and Reddit generally refuses to speak on individual bans, so as not to tip off other spammers to new tricks.

There is a real problem with spam-by-volume submitters, however. Submitting so many links easily pushes out the competition. When an online news editor like Keller has such an active Reddit account, he has another leg up on the competition. He doesn’t need to wait for a random redditor to find his company’s story first. He posts it himself, making it that much easier for The Atlantic to break news on Reddit.

That may do more harm than good in the long run, according to Martin.

“We’ve seen that publishers actually do better when their content is submitted organically by Reddit users,” Martin told me earlier this week. “You can really damage the brand, even if you’re not going to the extreme of vote manipulation.The author is never going to be as good at finding the right way to find a way to frame a submissions as the crowd.”

Whither The Redditor? The unofficial Reddit magazine shocked their readers on April 1, with the [announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/theredditor/comments/ro4n8/official_business_major_announcement_on_the/) the much-loved, user-run project would be shutting down. Most (quite reasonably) believed it was all an April Fools' joke. It wasn’t. There is some hope for the project, however. While editor Ryan Laing  and designer Jack Howard are out, for now, the third member of the team isn’t quite ready to give up.

“This is not the end of The Redditor,” Blair Drager [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/theredditor/comments/rq003/how_do_you_fool_someone_on_april_fools_nobody/) on Monday. “I'm taking some time to get re-organized, find several graphic designers ... and others to assist. I want this to continue because it's a great idea.”

1334347460.0,14,self.dailydot,s8g71,"This week on Reddit: A sick hoax, F7U12 quits early, and disappearing lightning bugs",kmmokai,17,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/s8g71/this_week_on_reddit_a_sick_hoax_f7u12_quits_early/,"Reddit’s collective frontal lobe seemed to malfunction on Thursday, as a frenzy of outrage and condemnation swirled around a bombshell post alleging that trolls on Reddit had driven a man to suicide. 

The redditor was Black_Visions, who, in a post last March titled [“A lot of trolls out tonight …”](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qoixk/a_lot_of_trolls_tonight/) threatened to kill himself, and was subsequently harassed in the thread. He then disappeared from Reddit, never to be seen again. His suicide threat was posted to [/r/MensRights](/r/MensRights), and the trolls harassing him had allegedly come from that subreddit’s frequent ideological enemy [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays). 

On Thursday, someone claiming to be Black_Vision’s sister had an update: He’d killed himself, and now her family was preparing a legal battle against the redditors who’d harassed him.

“Our family has decided to take legal action” against “those who urged him to take his own life,” she [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/s59ju/from_the_sister_of_black_visions_who_committed/). “Next week, our lawyer will be filing a wrongful death suit in Washington State against nine individuals.”

Redditors upvoted those allegations to the top of [r/subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s5cwt/mensrights_suicide_post_was_real_reddit/),[ r/mensrights](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/s59ju/from_the_sister_of_black_visions_who_committed/), [r/antisrs](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/s5dck/mra_goaded_by_srs_to_kill_himself_apparently_did/) and, in the hoax’s final coup, the massive [r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s60bw/a_month_ago_a_suicidal_redditor_left_his_final/). Multiple websites copied the allegations as well, without using a bit of critical thinking in their analyses. Meanwhile, the sister, who said her real name was “Sandy,” never provided a hint of evidence. Sure, Redditors dug up a newspaper story and police report that seemed to confirm some details of her story: A man in Washington State had leapt to his death from the 8th floor of a hotel. But that was hardly proof: It’s not exactly hard to find [reports of suicide online](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;btnmeta_news_search=1&amp;q=suicide&amp;oq=suicide&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=d2&amp;aql=&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i400.777.1453.0.1618.7.7.0.4.4.0.59.173.3.3.0.#q=suicide+man&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=43SIT4z-N6XW0QGT-dTcCQ&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=5d96b4b2fbb800f7&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=653), any of which an enterprising hoaxster could use to pilfer details.

Seattle police later [confirmed](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddits-wrongful-death-lawsuit-hoax/) the story was likely made-up. The woman said her brother’s name was Jerry and that he had a wife and a daughter. But the man who died in Washington--the man whose death the troll decided to use to prove some kind of sick point--wasn’t named Jerry and didn’t have a family. Case closed.

The largest push to reveal the hoax came from redditors themselves, but their skeptical contributions marched quite slowly to the top of comment threads. How was the scam so successful in the first place?  Was it mostly because members from [/r/ShitRedditSays](/r/ShitRedditSays), Reddit’s favorite bogeyman, seemed to bear responsibility for a man’s death? Or was it because the allegations themselves seemed to prove how comments on Reddit actually matter, that they bear serious and even deadly real-world consequences?

Can Reddit communities moderate themselves using the site’s voting system? “No,” the moderators of [/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu](/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu) [declared emphatically](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/rzhmo/since_you_guys_are_pretty_adamant_about_it_were/) on Sunday, as they ended what was supposed to a month-long experiment in user moderation three weeks early. They’d [launched the experiment](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu//comments/rolbw/after_careful_consideration_we_the_mods_have) in response to constant complaints from users who bristled at any form of rule enforcement--but it didn’t take long for others to start complaining even more vociferously  about the lack of moderation.

“Since the people who thought we need to have moderation outnumber those who don't (and that's our personal experience as well), we've decided to reinstate the rules,” top mod Poromenos wrote.  

Did they give up too early?

“/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu should have gone all out with no-mod-month,” [/r/dailydot](/r/dailydot) commenter LordCurlyFry [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/s0ozl/reddit_digest_monday_4912_music_and_biology/c4a9cls). “They backed out just when the community was realizing that they'd be borked without mods. Now nobody other than the mods themselves will learn a lesson in all this.”

Reddit’s done a lot of good for people around the world. Redditors have helped everyone from[ orphans in Kenya](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-faraja-children-orphanage/), to a[ three-year-old with a rare blood disease](http://www.dailydot.com/society/lucas-gonzalez-fundraising-goal/), to a dying [little girl in Saint Louis whose neighbors were bullying her](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dpwiu/reddit_kathleen_the_little_girl_who_was_being/c12194v). Now they’re rallying around one of their own: 

Just days after Reddit hired him as the site’s new community manager, David Croach found out he has Leukemia.

If you want to help Croach it’s easy, as Erik Martin, the site’s general manager, explained in [an official blog post](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/03/join-us-in-helping-one-of-our-own.html). Sign up at the [National Bone Marrow Donor Program](http://marrow.org/Home.aspx) and see if you’re match. Even if you don’t match with Croach, there’s a good chance someone else could use your help. Also, [forget what you’ve heard](http://marrow.org/Join/Myths_and_Facts/Myths___Facts_about_Donation.aspx) about incredibly painful bone marrow transplants. As Martin noted: “Don't worry, donation is painless these days.”

You’ve got nothing to lose.

But as he learned Sunday morning, most people don’t take jokes about school massacres lightly. Even on Reddit.

""I'm thinking about going on a shooting rampage all around campus until the police come and kill me,"" Song posted at the r/UMD forum Saturday night. Police arrested him twelve hours later after receiving phone calls from at least three Maryland students who had seen the post.

Did Reddit staff hand over Song’s identifying information? On Tuesday, Reddit general manager Erik Martin [told me](http://www.dailydot.com/news/alexander-song-shooting-rampage-reddit/) Reddit staff cooperated with the UMD police over the weekend, but wouldn’t elaborate further. 

He did add, however, that this is probably the first time anyone’s been arrested after making such a threat on Reddit. Usually, this kind of thing is confined to real-name social networks like Facebook. It’s often just a plea for attention, after all.

Interestingly, Reddit launched a “Grow a College Subreddit"" competition last fall that brought in [30,000](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/11/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html) new subscribers to the site’s various college forums. Those are local communities tied together not by interests—like most of Reddit—but by a real-world connection. The r/UMD event may be an unlikely but real sign of Reddit’s slow transformation from a link-sharing site to a pseudonymous social network.

—

The founder of Quickmeme, the popular image-captioning website, has finally opened his mouth regarding the Reddit ban of his site—and he's put his foot firmly in it.

In an email sent to the Daily Dot, Wayne Miltz defended his site against the ban, which has rocked Reddit's meme community. 

""There has been no malicious voting from quickmeme,"" Miltz said. ""We now believe the opposite has been used against us to maliciously push quickmeme out along with the [Reddit] user yourfriendshateyou providing false information and making false claims of which has happened in the past as well saying quickmeme host viruses and installs malware and the founders of quickmeme hate Reddit.""

In his email to the Daily Dot, Miltz alleged an elaborate conspiracy orchestrated by the creators of Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES), a popular Reddit browser plugin, and the meme-generating site livememe.com—a Quickmeme competitor—to bring down Quickmeme. 

…

Three months later, Sobel added hypah’s code to RES, even though hypah admitted on Github that ""if my server were ever compromised, a malicious party could replace the redirect URL with something else.""

Sobel says that, as far as he knows, the captioning feature of RES has only been used to redirect to Quickmeme pages. 

""If resme.me was later updated to do malicious stuff, that'd be 100 percent unbeknownst to me, and it would have nothing to do with RES other than RES being used (abused?) as a vehicle to send traffic to resme.me so that they could hatch their scheme.""

The most blockbuster revelation: power user [karmanaut](http://reddit.com/user/karmanaut) is the same person as [ProbablyHittingOnYou](http://reddit.com/user/probablyhittongonyou). Both sit at the top of Redit’s comment karma ranking. More importantly, both moderated several of Reddit's biggest subreddits.

This deception—at the top of the site’s most populous communities—has laid bare flaws in Reddit’s hierarchical structure, launching small but intense [pockets of debate](http://reddit.com/r/subredditdrama) across the site all week.

**

Many of the leaks were revealed by [sushisushisushi](http://reddit.com/user/sushisushisushi). They’re now known as [Sushileaks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/q0aq9/hueypriest_informs_a_poweruser_that_he_has_plans/c3tnu6s).

One interesting response to the Sushileaks fiasco: Why [should anyone care](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/q3cl5/why_default_mod_drama_should_interest_you/) about the squabbles of Reddit moderators? They’re just a bunch of pseudonymous Internet strangers.

Reddit’s default subreddits—the [20 communities](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html) every person subscribes to automatically when they sign up—are huge. Each drive hundreds of thousands of unique visitors daily. That’s enough traffic to make each place a valuable online property in its own right.

Right now, a small group of users hold sway over the majority of these subreddits and, therefore, control a huge proportion of Reddit, Inc’s traffic.

Moderators are unpaid volunteers. A subreddit is theirs to alter, censor, or play with as they see fit. This isn’t usually a problem, because most are hard-working volunteers who really care about the community.

But as karmanaut’s multiple-personality proclivity shows, there is potential for abuse, and there is no check on that abuse. Only a combination of admin and moderator intervention saved r/IAmA last year when that subreddit’s founder, 32bites, [decided to shut it down](http://www.dailydot.com/news/popular-iama-section-reddit-shut-down/).

Subreddit subscriptions should function in a kind of free market—if you don’t like the way a community is run, you migrate to its competitor. That works when the competition involves Reddit’s smaller communities but not when it includes one of Reddit’s semi-official communities: the defaults.

If you want to make a competitor to, say, [/r/AskReddit](/r/AskReddit)  or [/r/science](/r/science) , you’ll be handicapped from the start: You won’t just be competing with an established subscriber base in the millions; you’ll be fighting against the explicit support and endorsement of Reddit HQ.

What’s the practical value of that support? An endless stream of new subscribers thanks to the community’s default status, and, as the Sushileaks show, preferential access to the site’s paid staff.

“Moderators,” the Reddit FAQ [tells us](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faq), “have no special powers outside of the community they moderate, and are not appointed by reddit.”

That’s patently false.

Reddit’s default subscription system has created a privileged class of semi-official moderators. Most are hard working. Most clearly want to keep Reddit running smoothly and help the community flourish.

It took six years, thousands of complaints, and Anderson Cooper’s outrage, but Reddit finally gave in: the social news site [no longer](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/) houses suggestive or sexual content involving minors.

It was easy to see the change coming. When Reddit [banned](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-shutdown-controversy/) controversial teen pics section r/jailbait last October, the site's staff offered little explanation. That pretty much guaranteed they would have to turn that ban into a broader, site-wide policy.

Still, it took a surprisingly long time for the staff to finally make the move—a delay that only encouraged Reddit’s critics to paint the site [as a den of child pornograph](http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/reddit-bins-kiddies.php)y.

Some redditors are worried the move represents a slippery slope to censorship.

It doesn’t. Slippery slopes are [a logical fallacy](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/fallacies). But perhaps more importantly: the universal outrage spawned by accusations of child pornography is unique, for both its intensity and its ability to cause serious, long-term damage to the reputation of the community and company.

This was a one-of-a-kind event and protest. It’s not likely to happen again.

Reddit [announced](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-best-of-2011-wadsworth-honestbleeps-veros/) its annual awards this week. Big surprise, some people [aren’t happy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bestof2011/comments/pqtde/congratulations_to_polite_allcaps_guy_reddits/).

They want to know: How could [POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY](http://reddit.com/user/POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY), a novelty account, win commenter of the year?

Well, POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY will probably tell you he’s not a novelty account—he just types politely, in all caps. Beyond that, he just your normal everyday redditor.

His detractors, however, say his popularity is due entirely to the novelty of his caps lock shtick. (And besides, many wondered, how could he beat out[ RobotRollCall](http://reddit.com/user/RobotRollCall), the r/askscience commenter who could gracefully distill any mathematical and scientific complexity into lucid prose?)

But the POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY mini-controversy distracts from something that’s actually pretty cool about this year’s awards.

One of reddit’s best communities picked up two awards: [/r/askscience](/r/askscience)  won for best big community and for best moderators. Meanwhile, [/r/explainlikeimfive](/r/explainlikeimfive) —Reddit’s judgement-free curiosity zone—picked up the nod for best new community.

This year’s winner was social, crowd-sourced learning. That’s something worth celebrating.

Politicians, rest assured, are doing the same thing--spurred on by the scent of Rob Zerban’s $50,000.

Zerban, you may remember, was the congressional hopeful who redditors helped [propel](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/rob-zerban-paul-ryan-sopa-reddit/) to political fame, and in the process filled his war chest with a sizable chunk of cash. 

This week two other hopefuls showed up at the r/IAmA doorstep: Sheriff Richard Mack and Karen Kwiatkowski. Their opponents, not surprisingly, are both entrenched supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act--so reviled by redditors that in January Reddit shut down to protest the bill

That anti-SOPA message wasn’t enough to win over redditors this time, however.  Kwiatkowski [bombed](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/karen-kwiatkowski-sheriff-mack-reddit/) about halfway through her AMA. And though Serriff Mack impressed redditors with his responses and good humor, he has managed to raise only [a paltry $2,800 dollars to date](https://secure.piryx.com/donate/IFRtcDy9/Sheriff-Mack/crushsopa).

In the thread linked to above, blackstar9000 [compared](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pjlia/fly_fishing_for_political_change/) launching political and social movements on Reddit with fly-fishing: 

“When we push a rallying call to the front page, it's like standing in the river of Reddit's queue and casting a lure out into the stream. We're hoping to hook strong ties, the stronger the better, but if we don't catch them pretty quickly, there's nothing to do but cast again.”

An apt comparison, and one that also rings true for politicians as they fish for donations at r/IAmA. 

On Reddit’s biggest stage, however, you only cast that fly once. Better hope you catch something. 

**

Middling YouTube sensation The Amazing Atheist’s suffered a spectacular Reddit meltdown earlier this week. It was so bad you’d think the guy was fishing for outrage (just to keep that metaphor going). 

The Atheist, whose real name is T.J. Kincaid, started a flame war after[ threatening to rape an apparent rape survivor](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/pfejx/i_love_how_the_whiny_feminist_morality_brigade/c3p2bki?context=3). Kincaid later wrote that he didn’t mean what he said. He just wanted to make a point about “trigger warnings.” No one paid much attention to his message, however--his needlessly inflammatory delivery method ensured that much.

Reddit has a trifecta of subreddits that cover this kind of thing--[r/subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pgfox/internet_celebrity_posts_a_disparaging_comment/), [r/worstof](http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/pgc7s/youtube_personality_the_amazing_atheist_threatens/), and [r/shitredditsays](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/phj5x/meta_beardpocalypse_is_over_the_amazing_atheist/)--and each turned their unique kind of scornful ire on Kincaid. 

Together, they ran him from the site. Kincaid [made](http://blog.thatfatatheist.com/post/17271717670/p-z-liars) a public apology on his blog, but not before [deleting his Reddit account](http://www.reddit.com/user/terroja).

With calls for porn companies to [black out on Feb 23](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p6qvs/this_is_a_calling_for_all_pornographic_sites_to/), Reddit was about to take over the Internet again with a popular protest.

Except there was one problem.

Reddit’s outrage was predicated on a major misunderstanding. There’s very little in the act, called the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act (PCIP), that brought about new powers for the federal government. [As I wrote](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/reddit-pcip-lamar-smith-porn-blackout/) on Thursday, PCIP would simply turn a common practice among Internet service providers—holding on to temporary IP addresses—into formal law.

Where did the misunderstanding come from? The culprits are a wildly overstated [headline and inaccurate article](http://www.kansan.com/news/2012/jan/31/online-privacy/?news). Perhaps Dizzy_Slip, the redditor who posted the link to r/politics, didn’t realize that The Kansan is the [student newspaper at the University of Kansas](http://kansan.com/).

Or maybe that didn’t didn’t matter.

Outraged protests are so much fun.

This week belonged to Reddit’s atheists.

Over the weekend, the community made a huge fundraising push,[ raising more than $150,000 for renowned medical charity Doctors Without Borders](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-atheists-doctors-without-borders-charity/).

When I asked [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) moderator [tuber](http://www.reddit.com/user/tuber) if he had any point to prove with the fundraising drive, he said emphatically that he didn’t. “Speaking only for myself, I hope to improve lives, save lives, or both,” tuber wrote in a message. “Sending a message is not a significant motivator for me.”

Still, you can’t help but think that many other atheists did have a point to prove. At the FirstGiving site, redditors [picked up the phrase “Good without God” as a rallying cry](http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/r-atheism/ratheism). Atheists, they seemed to be saying, are just as charitable as anyone else.

Ulterior motives hardly take away from what the subreddit has accomplished. FirstGiving rep Dina Pradel [told me](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-atheists-charity-doctors-without-borders/) their most successful campaigns often hinge on some kind of group event or activity: a run, a walk, a bike race. In this case, the ulterior motive was proving atheists are good people. Nothing wrong with that.

There was one fairly significant difference, however. Normally, 40 percent of FirstGiving donors opt to pay the credit card fee. Reddit’s atheists paid that fee 60 percent of the time.

“These guys are really superstars of fundraising,” Pradel said.

**

The atheism community got excited about a lot more than charity this week. Specifically, the idea that gay porn—hosted on the domain WestboroBaptistChurch.xxx—[might be a powerful weapon in the fight against the insanely homophobic Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/n39xb/help_xxx_porn_sites_went_on_sale_today_just/). Even Gawker picked up on the idea. But since posting on Wednesday, redditor [VinCenzo831](http://reddit.com/user/VinCenzo831) has mostly disappeared, and his newly purchased .xxx domain remains in limbo.

**

Reddit was down all day Wednesday [for reasons that remain a little mysterious](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/n49rw/were_back/). Once it came back, you’d normally expect the site to be taken over with obnoxious self-referential image memes joking about how Reddit was down all day. To the site’s credit, that didn’t happen. A concrete example, perhaps, of how [shutting down r/reddit.com](http://www.dailydot.com/business/reddit-sections-subreddits-redesign/) and enforcing the rules in r/pics has been good for the site.

Of course, if “reddit is down, fear the imminent apocalypse” jokes are your thing, [you can always turn to Twitter](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-emergency-repairs-crisis/).

Is there a secret cabal of Reddit users who want to fundamentally change how the site works?

Not really.

SFWporn king and mega-mod syncretic, as well as dozens of other experienced mods on the sites, [are working on an experimental network of highly-curated subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/kdrdy/what_is_republicofreddit/). They call it “Republic of Reddit.” They’re hoping the network will provide some high-quality content -- alternatives and minor competitors to the meme-parties that have become the default subs.

Sounds pretty harmless. But that didn’t stop Reddit’s conspiracy theorists from[ wringing their hands about it all](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kdjas/i_dont_think_the_reddit_power_users_wanted_us_to/).

In other news, RedditGifts plans on [a massive Reddit costume contest for Halloween](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/today-redditgifts-announces-reddit.html). [We’re guessing](http://www.dailydot.com/news/halloween-costume-contest-reddit/) this will be one of the largest -- if not the largest -- costume parties on the planet. 

Reddit’s newest acquisition is also launching another gift exchange to go along with its Arbitrary Day and Secret Santa exchanges.

Except for this Halloween exchange, redditors can choose to give either treats or “tricks.” What will those tricks entail? We’re not entirely sure. But we’re fairly sure some will be terrifying.

Really, though, let’s be honest: Chuck Testa and Scarlett Johansson owned this week on Reddit. 

Mr. Testa, a California taxidermist (yes, he’s a real person who runs a real business -- [we interviewed him](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/chuck-testa-taxidermist-nope/)) became a Reddit meme star on Thursday after his [commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs&amp;feature=player_embedded) (made by YouTubers and IFC stars Rhett and Link) went viral on the site.

Meanwhile, Ms. Johansson’s nude photo leak led to [an almost unsustainable level of Internet excitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kf4oh/scarlett_johansson_leaked_ass_picture/). 

But the Internet didn’t collapse. 

And -- yet more amazingly -- neither did Reddit.

Cocky after their [successful GoDaddy boycott](http://www.dailydot.com/news/godaddy-boycott-reddit-numbers/), redditors [turned their attention to U.S. senators](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ntfzw/lets_pick_one_senator_of_voted_for_ndaasopa_and/).

“Let's pick ONE Senator [who] voted for National Defense Authorization Act/Stop Online Piracy Act and destroy him like we're doing for GoDaddy.” redditor digitalboy titled a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ntfzw/lets_pick_one_senator_of_voted_for_ndaasopa_and) at [/r/politics](/r/politics).

On the surface, this is a smart move. Forcing GoDaddy, a website-hosting company, to retreat from its pro-SOPA stance looks impressive, but doesn’t actually do much. Lawmakers have the real power when it comes to, you know, legislation, and as such make a much better target.

Senators aren’t likely to be quaking in their shoes over some noise on the Internet, however. This is U.S. politics—Reddit mobs and Internet trolls have nothing on the pros who organize political campaigns.

Still, there’s been some success. Rob Zerban, a competitor to Paul Ryan—an early target of Reddit’s rage—[raised more than $5,000 in 36 hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nwez5/thank_you_reddit_youve_helped_me_raised_over_5000/) after doing an AMA.

“Because of the AMA's success we have received lots of great press and significantly expanded the campaign's online presence,” Zerban wrote.

$5,000. That’s enough to buy a seat in Congress, right?

Sure, politicians are old pros at wading through public-relations shitstorms. But when you’re just a comically inept social media marketer, things aren’t so easy. That’s what Paul Christoforo learned after a juvenile and rude email he sent PennyArcade was [made public](http://penny-arcade.com/resources/just-wow1.html). Reddit[ latched onto the controversy](http://www.dailydot.com/news/avenger-paul-christoforo-controversy/) and propelled it into the viral stratosphere.

Unfortunately for all involved, Christoforo was dragging his client through the mud with him. N-Control, a maker of video-game controllers, had contracted its PR and customer-service work out to him.

No worries, though. The company quickly dumped Christoforo and replaced him with a suave PR pro, [Moisés Chiullan](http://www.dailydot.com/business/n-control-moises-chiullan-paul-christoforo/).

GoDaddy has [backed down](http://www.godaddy.com/newscenter/release-view.aspx?news_item_id=378&amp;isc=smtwsup) and no longer supports the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).

The web-hosting company’s decision comes after threats of a boycott reached Reddit’s front page multiple times over the past 24 hours. As of this morning, eight out of the top 10 posts on in the 550,000 strong [/r/technology](/r/technology) were about SOPA or GoDaddy. 

“In changing its position, Go Daddy remains steadfast in its promise to support security and stability of the Internet,” the company wrote in a statement. 

Company representatives then proceeded to delete any record of GoDaddy’s pro-SOPA stance from its official blog.

**

Why all the outrage? The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) could kill Reddit and other sites like it, according to site cofounder, [Alexis Ohanian](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/reddit-alexis-ohanian-stop-online-piracy-act/) and general manager, [Erik Martin](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nhfes/do_you_guys_realize_this_might_mean_reddit_might/c395f00). 

GoDaddy’s backpedaling on the issue represents a big victory in a kind of proxy war, but there’s still a lot of work to be done. 

On Thursday, Reddit general manager Erik Martin took to [/r/SOPA](/r/SOPA), where he [pleaded with redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nmz43/reddit_we_need_your_help_raising_awareness_about/) to help bring mainstream and local media attention to the bill.

“It's absolutely critical,” Martin wrote, “that we raise awareness of SOPA/PIPA and the devastating impact they would have on all manner of small businesses that rely on the internet to sell and market their goods and services.”

**

On Thursday, redditors were up to good things—well, mostly good, at any rate. After [a post about bone marrow donation hit the site’s front page](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-bone-marrow-transplant-center-registration/), the [Bone Marrow Donor Center reported a whopping 650 new registrants](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-bone-marrow-transplant-center-registration/). 

Around the same time, redditors used their Google talents to find an [adoptee's birth family in under three hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/nlqz6/looking_for_my_birth_parents_from_denverlittleton/). Too bad they couldn’t restrain themselves from [posting topless photos they found of his long-lost sister](http://gawker.com/5870479/reddit-tracks-down-adoptees-family-and-his-biological-sisters-boobs).

**

In other news, the site’s volunteer staff of moderators [finally have a log](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/nkj5s/moderators_moderation_log/). Sure, it sounds boring, but this is actually a big step forward in adding transparency and efficiency to the moderators workload. Considering these guys basically run the site’s subreddits, the ability to track who does what and when is an important addition for the site as a whole.

“If SOPA existed, Steve &amp; I never could've started reddit,” [he titled a post on r/SOPA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nd0jm/if_sopa_existed_steve_i_never_couldve_started/), referencing fellow co-founder Steve Huffman. “Please help us win.”

Reddit’s current staff jumped into the fight as well, urging redditors to join [/r/sopa](/r/sopa) with a rare frontpage ad.

The social news site has actually played a big role in raising awareness about the issue. The r/technology section was largely responsible for gathering nearly [40,000 signatures for an anti-SOPA petition on the official White House site](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/stop-e-parasite-act/SWBYXX55). And a number of SOPA posts [have hit Reddit’s front page in recent days](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=SOPA).

At the congressional hearings, Colorado representative[ Jared Polis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis) even cited Reddit as one of the places that SOPA will hurt.

**

Meanwhile, all that special attention for [/r/SOPA](/r/SOPA) created a traffic and subscription surge for the section. Before Ohanian’s post, only a few hundred people subscribed to the subreddit. Two days later, that number’s surpassed 4,000. Impressions shot up from 54 on Dec. 13 to [an astonishing 658,162 by Dec. 15, according to traffic stats released on r/TheoryOfReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/nf08j/the_rapid_rise_and_change_of_rsopa/).

As a result, serious discussion has quickly been replaced by memes and image macros. In a way, the r/SOPA traffic surge and transformation provides a perfect end-of-year microcosm of Reddit’s recent troubles: How can thoughtful textual posts survive, when image posts are so much easier to see and upvote?

Questions still linger over r/jailbait’s closing and the proliferation of sexualized photographs of teenagers on a half-dozen or so subreddits. The site’s staff have yet to make a public statement, leaving the situation largely unresolved.

Still, Reddit seemed to have at least partially stepped out of the maelstrom. Redditors were up to some good things this week.

**

The [r/LGBT](http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBT) community [rallied to support](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/lhq5d/make_this_kid_feel_loved/) a gay teen who was the victim of some pretty nasty online bullying.

Meanwhile, others were busy expanding the breadth of Reddit’s charitable subreddits. At [r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza), people have been giving away pizzas to strangers for months now -- all in the name of charity, and fun.

So why not other things? Cookies? Beer? Cash? Star Wars toys? The recently minted [r/RandomKindness](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness) is kind of like r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza’s bigger brother. It encompasses anything and everything. Even, it turns out, [friendships for the forever alone](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ljfap/request_girlfriend/).

**

There was more good-for-Reddit news, however. Earlier today Reddit admins [made it clear](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ljf4e/dear_reddit_i_do_not_think_that_ideas_that_are/c2t72e2) they had no intention to requisition any of James Erwin‘s (aka [Prufrock451](http://www.reddit.com/user/prufrock451)), Hollywood success. The man whose comment launched a Warner’s Bros. movie deal is free to make a movie as he (and Warner Bros.) sees fit.

As Reddit general manager hueypriest, aka Erik Martin, wrote: “It would be completely against our interests to sabotage something awesome created by a Redditor.”

That was despite [doubts placed on the deal by the Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/does-warner-bros-have-movie-250726), who brought up some interesting lines from the Reddit user agreement.

As I [argued yesterday](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/movie-deal-reddit-copyright-warner-james-erwin/), a legal battle over RomeSweetRome would be a pretty disastrous PR move for Reddit.  And as Martin made clear, they’re not going to make it.

**

Meanwhle, in a homepage shuffle, Reddit [added 11 new default subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html), and shut down another, r/reddit.com (a vestige of the site’s days before the subreddit system was implemented).

As Martin [told us](http://www.dailydot.com/business/reddit-sections-subreddits-redesign/), this is a “baby” step in bringing greater customizability to the site -- or to be more  precise, letting new or casual users know that customizability even exists.

It’s also bringing some growing pains as new users flood some highly esteemed sections, such as r/AskScience, where moderators are [struggling to control users who disobey the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ljapx/strict_comment_moderation_in_askscience_currently/).

That problem really highlights the conflict at the core of Reddit right now: does popularity bring mediocrity?

The network of eight subreddits (r/RepublicOfAtheism, r/RepublicOfNews, etc) are replacements, or at least refuges, from the image and meme parties of the default subs. 

Here's our[ full story](http://www.dailydot.com/society/republic-of-reddit-launch) on the Republic's launch.

One thing that really stood out about the people behind this: They've put a lot of thought and effort into a website and community they seem to care about deeply. 

They've got some interesting thoughts on what makes subreddits work, and how to manage and grow a good community.

I had a Reddit-sitdown with just a few of these guys. Here's a slightly edited version of that interview. 

Many thanks to Wordslinger1919 and jaxspider for setting this all up.

***Starting with the basics: What exactly is Republic of Reddit?***

**syncretic:** The Republic of Reddit is a network of subreddits that aim to provide well moderated alternatives to the default subreddits, subreddits that were default in the past, or other large subreddits where a large percentage of the userbase is discontent with the status quo.


**blackstar9000:** There's basically two parts to the idea, and they're designed to offset one another. The first is to moderate for content; the second is to set rules for moderation so that the users have some recourse should they feel that the moderators are being unfair. The result is two documents that will govern the Network. One is the Charter, which spells out how moderators should behave and how the community can get rid of them if they misbehave. The other is the Republiquette, which like the rediquette, only with more spine.


**Aguyinachair:** In the end though, the bigger job is getting things running, talking about ideas isn't something you need hundreds of people for. We've been planning this all for a month but if we're the only ones interested in it, then it's not really that impressive. Considering what syncretic has done with the SFWPorn series though, I think we've got a good shot.

***How many subreddits are you creating and managing?***


**syncretic:** There are currently a total of eight subreddits in the network, with a few more potentially in the works. The list we have so far is pics, funny, gaming, atheism, politics and music. There is definitely some sort of news subreddit on the way, and I have been mulling over the idea of a wtf subreddit.


**Aguyinachair:** I don't think there will be any upper limit on how many that could/should be created however, as long as there is a need for a new subreddit and there is someone who will dutifully mod the place, we will make it.
Who came up with the idea and where did it gestate? When was this? What were the steps for moving from idea to reality?


**syncretic:** About a month ago, glyserinesoul offered a few empty subreddits up for grabs in the SFWPorn moderator discussion subreddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PornOverlords/comments/jxwyl/so_this_post_isnt_about_the_sfwporn_networkbut_i/). Wordslinger expressed interest in /r/RepublicOfReddit, and the name immediately gave me an idea as well. What the project turned into is vastly different than my [initial reaction](http://www.reddit.com/r/PornOverlords/comments/jxwyl/so_this_post_isnt_about_the_sfwporn_networkbut_i/c2g43ou), but things evolved from there [pretty quickly](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/k2agy/discussion_thread/).


**blackstar9000:** The steps are a little hard to follow, but soon /r/RoR will be open to the public, and everyone will be able to sort through those threads themselves. One of the rules that we set for ourselves somewhere along the way was that moderator discussions should be made out in the open, and we've been making a concerted effort to have as close to zero discussions in mod mail as possible, so nearly the whole of the decision-making process will be available for anyone with the fortitude to wade through it.


**Aguyinachair:** When the admins made a statement confirming that mods were the ones in control of the subreddits, there was a new pushback, but it didn't address any of the underlying problems going on, it just made it clear that moderators had a right to do what they wanted with the subreddits they had. As far as developing the idea, it became a practice of finding the best way to provide a better experience for the people who were tired of memes, but doing so without affecting the majority of the user base that does enjoy them.

This was the same issue which reddit faced literally a couple years ago, and the solution then was simply to 'burrow' into smaller subreddits. But this wasn't really a long-term solution, you can only subscribe to so many subreddits, not to mention that the spread of memes always left the smaller subreddits open to being 'ruined' in the same way as the original places. The only way we saw to fix the problem would be to actively remove things that didn't belong,, but doing so in the larger subreddits would mean upsetting the majority of new members. RoR basically is a soft reset on reddit as a whole, a chance for the people who want less meme content to join up with the knowledge that off-topic posts will be actively moderated.

For a long time, I have seen picture's of family members on reddit; grandfather's from the military, mothers who create baked goods.  Whenever I saw them, a part of me thought, ""Well, I should post pictures of my grandfather on reddit.""  But, to be honest, I never bothered.  Reddit can be a harsh mistress and after I saw the success of other user's family members, I wasn't sure that I could take the rejection if mine happened to be the one where the tides changed and reddit decided it had enough of grandparents and such.

With our book about him and my grandmother finally complete, we (my mother and I) have been talking to a much larger number of people about my grandparents than ever before.  When I was growing up, it was a strange thing to have a National Geographic photographer as a grandparent; at the same time I was immensely proud, but this pride made me also feel as I were somehow bragging when it came up.  So for a long time, I hadn't really conversed with anyone about his career and accomplishments.  But with the book out, I was given another chance to tell people about him.  And it sort of reminded me that what he had done in life was remarkable and worth sharing—when I tell people about what he did, they just can't believe it, they want to meet him or, just as often, wast to *be* him.  

So between reddit's (apparent) love of grandparents and such, and the reminder (in a sense) that I had an extraordinary grandfather was what led me to post those pictures to reddit.  It was a sort of challenge choosing the pictures to include—I left out, for instance, him leading a caravan of 1000s of camels, a shot of him behind the wheel of the maharaja's chrome-bodied Rolls Royce (I think), playing buz kashi in Afghanistan (think polo with the body of a goat for a ball), removing a pilgrim's frostbit toe while seeking the source of the Indus River, and receiving the Baltic Cup for Sailing from the prince of Denmark.  At the same, though, his life made the choice easy: I knew any photos I chose would carry an amazing story behind them.

As far as the reaction of reddit, we (my mother and I) were amazed.  I've been a subscriber to reddit for over 2 years, and nothing I've submitted has passed the 200 upvote mark.  She'd never really seen reddit before, aside from a few links that I'd passed along to her.  She Facebooks (that's a verb, right?), and has a Facebook page for Tom.  She has seen popular success with that page, with Tom gathering about 300 ""fans"" from all around the world.  Tom made friends wherever he went, and many stayed his friend over the years.  But Facebook is obviously different than reddit—it's for people who already know you, or in this case, him.  So her reaction can be summarized by two (or three) points.  (1) She was overjoyed to see so many new people learn about her father.  Reddit's primary demographic, I imagine, are people who were just born or were very young when he retired, so she sees this as having reach a whole new generation. (2) She was blown-away by the number of people who responded, either by voting or by comment.  On Facebook, when she posts something about Tom or the book, she is happy to get a dozen or so replies.  On reddit, we received over 600 comments, nearly all of them positive.  (We even got a reply from someone in, I believe, Syria, who had just seen the article on Tom entitle A Geographic Life in the new Arabic language edition of the Geographic.  He offered to scan it and send it to us, as we were not ever aware that this was happening.)  And (3) I showed her the number of views on imgur.  That she could not believe.  The last time I checked it, the pictures of my grandfather had something like 600k views.  We live in Maine; that's more than half the entire state's population.

My grandfather's reaction to it, had he been alive today, would have been…interesting.  A tinkerer and a DIY-guy through and through, I think had he had the time to made the transition to a digital world, he would have appreciated all that it offers.  Taking after him, my uncle loves to go to Youtube and see what contraptions people are building, and to get ideas for DIY projects for himself.  As it was, he was just getting into the world of digital photography when he passed, but a Geographic photographer had to love the idea of not having to carry around dozens or even 100s of rolls of film with him into the field.  I never really knew his views on media and journalism, but I know that he loved to share.  And I think that aspect of reddit would have really appealled to him; the fact that anyone with something to share can bring it to the crowd's attention, and that the users of the site, and not some editor or boardroom executive decides what the front page looks like each day.  There's a quote in our book from him that says that if he added just a single plank to the bridge of understanding between the peoples of the world, then he could die happy.  Well, he added a great deal more than a single plank, but that's besides the point.  I think this possibility of reddit and the internet in general would have greatly appealled to him—the possibility to bring together people from around the world into a forum where they can share ideas, culture, and information.  Though he would have rather traveled the world than sat at a computer.

Really, though, Tom was an immensely modest man.  I'm not sure he would have liked, or rather understood, his popularity on reddit.  Whenever he'd share a story, it was never to brag or to boast, but just to join in the conversation.  The way that if you were talking about movies with a friend, he or she might mention a movie they'd seen, Tom would mention his trips to the Sahara or the South Pole.  Never to one-up, but to sympathize and to share.  He didn't want the book to be about *him*, just a book of some of his pictures since so many said he should.  (Once when I was returning home from Florida and I mentioned the heat, he mentioned the heat in the Sahara.  Again, not to one-up me or put me in my place, but more to say, ""Oh yeah.  Heat sucks.  I was in the Sahara, and I know how bad the heat can be.""  So I think a reddit post saying, ""Look at all the stuff I did"" would just be bragging to him; it would really have a place anywhere in his opinion.  

tl;dr:  Reddit loves grandfathers.  Making my book I realized, I have a wicked cool grandfather.  We were sort of shocked by the positive response.  He would have thought it was strange, but with a great potential if it wasn't about him.

SOPA threatens the Internet as we know it. Redditors, for the most part, get that. While big media has obsessed over the presidential race and largely ignored the controversial bill, SOPA has dominated Reddit’s front page for months now.  

That’s why Reddit [is turning off the lights for 12 hours to protest on Jan. 18](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/breaking-reddit-blackout-sopa-protest/). As I [noted earlier this week](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/reddit-sopa-blackout-protest-interview/), Reddit’s staff understand this looks like preaching to the converted; redditors have led the online charge against SOPA, often with great success.

In that sense, the Reddit shut down basically shutters the biggest anti-SOPA echo chamber on the Internet—the same day congressional hearings resume. But Reddit’s bold move is about a lot more than just making a statement to their own users.

“We want to make it impossible not to cover [SOPA],” Martin said, observing that many of the big media companies who support SOPA have hardly covered the controversial bill.

Get that? It’s not about educating redditors.

It’s a statement. From: Reddit. To: big media.

**

One media voice that’s been surprisingly silent on SOPA is the Daily Show’s Jon Stewart.

No worries! Redditor have that covered, too. They sent an emissary straight to the Daily Show’s New York studios.

On Tuesday, redditor place_face turned to r/politics, telling them he [got his hands on VIP tickets to the show](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ocely/i_have_vip_passes_to_the_daily_show_tonight_what/). He said he’d probably have a chance to talk to Stewart, and wondered what he should say about SOPA. On Wednesday, he [posted another thread with an update](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/od6qy/i_asked_jon_stewart_about_sopa_he_said_hed_look/):

&gt;I was able to ask Jon during the Q&amp;A before the show what his thoughts on SOPA were and why he hasn't talked about it. His answer was that they've had their heads so far up the elections ass that they may have missed it. He then said he'd look into it, and mentioned it during the opening of the show!
&gt;
Indeed. “Tomorrow night,” Stewart during Wednesday’s lead-in, “our guest will be the Internet.”

Unfortunately, Stewart didn't deliver. There's always next week, though.

Still, there was some rabble-rousing. 0celot [encouraged redditors to re-examine Digg](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kj2e9/new_digg_versus_new_reddit_cold_hard_truth/), whose frontpage nowadays looks surprisingly good (and image free). 

That post shot to Reddit's front page -- meaning there was a front page image post complaining about the quality of front page posts on reddit and especially the number of front page image posts.

Seems ironic. But that was probably the point -- would 0celot's post have made to the front page *without* an image?

In r/IAmA, [another cancer hoaxster](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/kl4nj/im_17_i_have_3_months_to_live_ask_me_anything/) may have been trying to cash in on reddit's generosity, though that was nipped in the bud by some astute users. It's the second high-profile fake cancer AMA this year -- the kind of thing that can really throw the community into dissarray.

But the r/IAmA mods did their (volunteer) job with commendable alacrity,[shutting down the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/kl83r/iama_from_the_kid_with_cancer_has_been_removed/) before any financial shenanigans could transpire. 

The best part: shortly after the post was deleted a number of other verifiable posts by real cancer victims popped-up. The community had corrected itself.

The Internet Tough Guy is ""the defining image of geeks and nerds since the dawn of computers"" [according to redditor honestquestiontime](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kkcc6/update/c2kycsj). But an image posted to r/pics earlier this week hinted that everyone's favorite emblematic nerd had[ undergone a pretty suave transformation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kkcc6/update/)n.

But we [dug a little deeper](http://www.dailydot.com/society/internet-tough-guy-mystery/), and found an old Fark thread that should put all this to rest. The man is Tim Madison -- a Fark user himself -- and he promises that he really, really is not the same person.

“After reading all the posts I just want to make myself very clear,” he [wrote on Fark](http://www.fark.com/comments/5504947/62152911#c62152911). “I never said I was the original Internet tough guy meme. I am the guy being compared to him.” 

That may be for the best. Image memes function best obscured with a shroud of anonymity. The Internet Tough Guy will always be whatever the Internet wants him to be -- a character that represents any nerd's self-effacing perception of himself.

Finally, r/trees threw their considerable weight behind a petition on the White Houses' official page to legalize marijuana. The subreddit easily brought more than 5,000 signatures, the minimum required to elicit a full response from the White House.

But this isn't anything new -- in fact, I profiled the r/trees community yesterday after speaking to a number of major pro-pot legalization groups. r/trees it turns out, is much more than just an entertainingly inane subreddit with a sometimes-serious bent.

This is by Kevin Collier, who forgot to post here.* &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Of all the major sites to go black this Wednesday to protest the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA), remember that Reddit led the charge.

The social news site’s vow of silence on Jan. 10 was a calculated move: A blackout not only decidedly caught the attention of anyone who wanted to access the site, it gave them a very real taste of what it would be like if SOPA passed. Reddit cofounder Alex Ohanian has repeatedly [stressed](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/reddit-alexis-ohanian-stop-online-piracy-act/) that if passed, SOPA would mean the end of the site.

BoingBoing made its [announcement](http://boingboing.net/2012/01/14/boing-boing-will-go-dark-on-ja.html) four days after Reddit, followed by Craigslist and [Wikipedia](http://www.dailydot.com/news/internet-going-strike-protest-sopa-and-pipa/) two days after that, and finally [Mozilla](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2012/01/17/mozilla-to-join-tomorrows-virtual-protests-of-pipasopa/).

And it worked. At least 18 senators [declared](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/sopa-protest-results/) opposition to PIPA and 25 to SOPA. That’s something. Reddit cofounder Alex Ohanian called it a “resounding success” in a television interview.

Of course, the war against political forces that want to limit the Internet may never be over.

“I'm seeing a lot of people that think that because we did well today the battle is over,” wrote one redditor. “PIPA still has broad support in the Senate. Time for the next phase, not the victory party.” Others warn against Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), a pending international trade agreement.

Still, when it was over, scores of subreddits reported [very little change](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/omu4t/reddit_mods_can_we_see_some_traffic_stats_after/) in activity between pre- and post-blackout. It’s as if redditors were utterly unfazed by their time away from the site, neither desperate to return once the blackout ended nor forgetting to tune back in when they were first able.

But for the moment, at least, it’s a return to business as usual Reddit.",,False,,t5_2so3f,False,,,True,t3_os86n,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/os86n/this_week_on_reddit_leading_the_fight_against_sopa/,

Lucas Gonzalez's case was a moment of urgent and specific need. But Reddit’s generosity is often wholly random and a little insane.

Last night, for instance, at one of the greatest Web communities around, [r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza](http://reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza), redditor IdTugYourBoat went mad with pizza power, slinging out pies with generous abandon (by our count, about 25 in total).

IdTugYourBoat [explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/mwl6r/offerca_bitch_its_the_holiday_season_a_time_for/): ""I don’t care if you’re a college student living off Top Ramen, a single mother living paycheck to paycheck with a dozen mouths to feed, a frequently masturbating goat herder, or just a lonely person needing some cheesy closure; whatever, I don’t care.

She probably expected that comment to remain pseudonymous. But when a site boasts about 30 million unique visitors every month, there’s always a chance for some real world serendipity.

A reddit comment has led to a movie deal.

Prufrock451's epic posts in r/askreddit last week thread got noticed by a whole lot of redditors and, apparently, a Hollywood production studio. 

[He's struck a deal to write a write a screenplay for a movie](http://www.reddit.com/r/RomeSweetRome/comments/k7xlr/an_announcement/).

""I was thinking that maybe a couple hundred people would take a few seconds to say ‘That was fun’ or even just vote on the comment,”[ he told us](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/reddit-comment-movie-deal/). “That would have been great. Like nailing a set at a big open-mic night or something. I never would have expected a response like the one I got.”

Let's hope the trailer begins like this: ""Spawned from a comment on Reddit ...""

** 


Meanwhile, after a postive response to a community poll, [ r/starcraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft) [started a no self-post policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/k58aj/announcement_rstarcraft_is_now_in_textself/), then ended it almost as quickly due to community backlash. This led [some at r/theoryofreddit to postulate on how meaningless community polls really are](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/k92w2/rstarcraft_demonstrates_why_you_cant_trust/).

""In reading the two relevant threads though,"" [Deimorz wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/k92w2/rstarcraft_demonstrates_why_you_cant_trust/), ""I found it interesting that in both cases, the comments and votes seemed to overwhelmingly display an opposing opinion to each announcement. I think it makes a great demonstration of the fact that the users that are most strongly opposed to something are the ones most likely to participate heavily. The ones that are happy about it don't get nearly as involved, they just accept it.""

Finally, this week’s biggest news is actually last week’s news.

Reddit is independent -- well, kind of.

Conde Nast still owns Reddit. But Reddit is no longer a division of the publishing giant. It’s a separate company: Reddit Inc. Conde Nast is out of the day-to-day operations.

The announcement[ came too late last week to include in our roundup](http://www.dailydot.com/business/reddit-conde-nast-spinoff-independence/). We talked to Erik Martin about what the changes would mean: “The community’s done awesome. We haven’t been able to do as much as we liked to support that. This will allow us to build tools to catch up to the innovations the community has made.”

He added: “It allows us to move faster -- allows us to be more like a startup.”

We've collected a few of the responses below.

Note: We have condensed some these quotes for brevity. Please click through to read them in context and in their entirety.

[r/theoryofreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jga45/reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and_misogyny/):

In TOR, the debate seemed to settle along a simple theme: Don't feed the troll.

[prosh](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jga45/reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and_misogyny/c2bunqj):

&gt;I am so tired of seeing places such as r/BeatingWomen taken as legitimate forums for the topics they contain. Trolling has been a commonly known and understood behaviour in almost all internet communities for years, and even out-of-touch journalists who write about such trivial things seem to have a basic understanding of the concept. Why are the subreddits mentioned in this article any different to FastOCR's comments or websites containing 'gore shock' images like Lemon Party and Goatse?

&gt;Those subreddits are certainly on the higher end of the offensive scale, and I suppose it's not surprising that the many journalists who've written about this topic well before Mr. Alfonso have been unable to separate the trolling from the content, just as he has. I'd wager that most people who've not been acclimatised to internet culture would react similarly. However, I find the fact that heavily-involved Reddit users are also unable to do this very surprising.

[jacobmarley](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jga45/reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and_misogyny/c2buyu6):

&gt;I'm surprised that the defence of redtdit's laissez faire approach to all this did not mention the incredible cost it would take to implement the level of screening that would be needed. Never mind the trouble that comes from declaring yourself the 'morality police' in any forum. Or that if the discussions in those subreddits were removed and banned, then the users would just move to another site (or create their own).
&gt;There are many issues any open web forum is contending with here. Perhaps the response was kept simple because it was easier to say/quote/print?

[dhlvl2717](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jga45/reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and_misogyny/c2bx1xt):

&gt;There's a reason subreddits exist. It's to divide one aspect of the community with the other incompatible aspects of it. Meaning that all the women can go in one place and all the jokes about beating women can go in the other. They don't want to have anything to do with each other and so they stay away from each other. So I think the article is making too big a deal out of it. This is the internet. The internet doesn't give us anything except freedom. And if you're not happy with what you see other people doing, then don't look at it.

Meanwhile, in [r/TwoXChromosomes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/) redditors were much more concerned about the free speech implications of subreddits like r/beatingwomen.

[fxexular](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/c2bxmy4):

&gt;I think racism is a bigger issue on this website than misogyny. I compiled a list of some racism recently and it didn't take very long to get over a hundred highly-upvoted examples. I'm compiling another one for misogyny and it's taking longer to do!
&gt;I'd be happy if this stuff were banned. Conde Naste is a private company and this is their website, and they have no obligation to defend the free speech of trolls. I feel also that eventually, they may well have to do something about it. Reddit is gaining more and more users every day. Communities like r/beatingwomen and r/niggers or whatever, and the perverted folk heroes of reddit who run them, are PR disasters waiting to happen.

[room23](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/c2bxr4v)

&gt;I think Reddit would survive if outright racist, homophobic and misogynistic/misandrist subreddits would be banned. The people who come here for such content can just go back to 4chan or wherever else they came from.

[LyannaStark](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/c2bxxbn)

&gt;I draw a line where the law draws it, not my personal feelings. If I don't like what people are talking about, I don't go there. Your appeal to emotion is touching, but all it's saying is that only people who agree with you have the right to self-expression without persecution.

Finally, violentacrez[ has denied creating or moderating r/beatingwomen](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jgnh1/thedailydot_reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and/c2by32h). As recently as May of this year, however, [the redditor claimed differently](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gFjkY61TB7IJ:www.reddit.com/hi5up+%22reddits+i+moderate%22+violentacrez&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com).

And politicians are listening. 

This week, [politics truly arrived on Reddit](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/campaigning-reddit-political-power-candidates/).

Sure, [/r/politics](/r/politics) boasts nearly a million rabid readers and is really active in influencing popular political opinion on Reddit. But politicians themselves have largely ignored Reddit, taking their social media campaigns to more mainstream outfits like Twitter and [Facebook](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/gop-debate-nbc-facebook-primaries-new-hampshire/).

One thing that speaks even louder than two billion page views, however, is hard cash. With the news that Rob Zerban [raised more than $15,000 after an AMA](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/rob-zerban-paul-ryan-sopa-reddit/), it was only a matter of time before other politicians began stampeding through Reddit’s gates.

And it happened within a few days. First, New York City congressional hopeful Mike Scala [told seductive tales of social libertarianism at r/IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o1on7/im_mike_scala_iama_candidate_running_for_congress/). Then, last night Republican presidential longshot Buddy Roemer [took a break from cracking jokes on Twitter](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/buddy-roemer-twitter-jokes/) to [do his own AMA](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/ron-paul-reddit-satire/). 

Hey. Ron Paul, [when’s your AMA scheduled](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/ron-paul-reddit-satire/)?

**

And as for those two billion page views: Reddit’s traffic numbers from 2011 demonstrate some astonishing growth. The site [has octupled in size from two years ago, and doubled from a year ago](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-two-billion-page-views-december/). 

How much more can Reddit expand? Is the site becoming bloated, and is the growth unsustainable? A lot of redditors believe—or, at least suspect so. 

The fact is, however, that Reddit’s subreddit system supports almost infinite growth. Reddit isn’t just [the winner in a social news battle with Digg](http://mashable.com/2011/04/28/reddit-digg-traffic/). It long ago began to replace the Web’s millions of scattered bulletin boards and forums. As such, it’s quickly becoming a centralized hub of discussion online. 

Of course, a mass exodus of old users is always possible, especially as specialized communities become overpopulated and under-moderated. To cope, the site simply needs better tools for moderation, discovery, and customization.

For his part, Reddit general manager Erik Martin has [hinted all of these are in the works](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/2-billion-beyond.html):

&gt;There are redditors who feel reddit is getting too big, and even if we don't always reach the same conclusions, we see the same trends and patterns you do. We have some improvements coming that will help redditors discover new subreddits, help new users better understand the way reddit works, and provide better tools to support the moderators of both big and small subreddits. We're also going to keep improving the infrastructure so that the site will be faster and more stable even as growth continues.

Below, I've copied portions of an email Telltale games CTO Kevin Bruner sent me earlier today.

**On Reddit's reaction**

We received quite a few mails to our pr address, and Dan had some actual death threats. Our Facebook page filled up with posts about this and people were certainly tweeting. This is why I made the call to answer in a public forum . . . 

I have no idea how or why someone would choose to harass ----- because of this. She did absolutely nothing wrong. The general vibe around here was surprise and a lot of anger and sense that this was incredibly unfair and misleading.

We were really happy to see so many people come to our defense, as well as have so many new people learn about Telltale. One thing that bugs me is how some people assumed we're a corporate entity that was trying to screw this guy. Trust me, making on-line adventure games is not the fastest path to world domination, and we're not big enough to screw the little guy. I hope we never become that, but the popular meme is to vilify everything as if it we're Enron, and damn the specifics.

**Was it all a bizarre PR stunt?**

This was absolutely not a planned PR stunt by us. I believe Boomer was planning the PR stunt. We just took the bait. 

**How long have you been working on the game, and how did you react to the allegations?**

We've been working on Jurassic Park for about a year now. It's easily our most ambitious project to date, and very likely our most controversial due to it's ambitious design. When we decided to make a company dedicated to modernizing adventure games, we knew the best way to do this was going directly to the audience via the internet, so we've always been pretty active in the community, and accepting of it warts and all. I think we have a reputation of doing the right thing and really trying to treat our customers well. Our history speaks for itself in this regard. 


**What about online witch hunts?
**

These are interesting times. The internet is indeed a powerful tool that can really empower people to make real change in the world. The last presidential election is the best proof of that that I can think of, but people don't seem to realize that this isn't a special medium that absolves you of responsibility just because there's a veil of annonymity. I refuse to believe that all these people would act this way in real life, and threaten ------ or Telltale. Why people feel like it's fine to behave like this on the internet is troubling, but I also believe we're on a bit of an infancy as a responsible internet society, and that as we grow-up, things like this will become less common. The good news is it would appear in this case that those who didn't jump to conclusions and remanded objective are going to be the real winners, which is how I hope it always would be.",,False,,t5_2so3f,False,,,True,t3_mdo9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/mdo9w/telltale_games_cto_and_founder_kevin_bruner_were/,

Speaking of lifting photos: Why is College Humor [nabbing redditors' original photographs without permission](http://www.dailydot.com/business/reddit-collegehumor-copying-images/)? A tip led us to discover multiple instances of potential copyright infringement perpetrated by the humor site -- a place whose reputation was built on great original content. 

It receives about 8 million hits a week, and its parent company, IAC, is valued at nearly $3.5 billion. Is asking permission really that hard?

Reddit’s news wasn’t all scurrilous this week. Take the case of Prufrock451, for instance. He wrote [some pretty good comments last month](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k067x/could_i_destroy_the_entire_roman_empire_during/) about a battalion of marines teleported in time to the era of Augustus Caesar. All he got was a boatload of Reddit karma. 

Oh, and [a movie deal](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/warner-brothers-signs-romesweetrome/).

On Thursday night,[ Variety reported](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118044449) that Warner Bros. had picked up the rights to Rome Sweet Rome earlier this week -- showing that perhaps Reddit isn’t quite the time waste everyone thinks it is. 

This morning I sent Prufrock451, aka James Erwin, a 37-year-old technical writer (and two time Jeopardy champ!), an email asking him what it felt like to be legit Hollywood screenwriter. 

His answer: “Terrifying! Incredibly great but terrifying.”

The project has already moved from comment to movie deal in less than a month. Does that mean we can expect to see the full feature film by, say, this Christmas?

Orsini interviewed documentarian Mary Ratliff, who is producing a film about professional gamers.

“Fans get to participate in the culture of professional gaming, not just watch,” Ratliff told Orsini. “I don't think that it's at all surprising that the players who are the most active online with forums like Reddit and Twitter are the ones that get the most attention and front page articles.”

When [Forthewolfx](http://www.reddit.com/user/Forthewolfx), a 14-year-old high school student, asked Reddit to make him a celebrity last month, Redditors complied. They set up a subreddit in his honor. They reference his name, dramatically, in casual conversations across the site (sometimes in [very inappropriate situations](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l0fui/who_is_your_favourite_porn_star/c2orcri)).

Even our own story on the teenager received [the fawning adulation](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/reddit-forthewolfx-celebrity/?fb_comment_id=fbc_10150349482037556_20122863_10150350149247556#f3264a5db4) of Forthewolfx’s Reddit fans.

“There is no better feeling than waking up and finding out you are famous, it’s a hollywood christmas,” Forthewolfx wrote of his Reddit celebrity.

What’s he done with his fame? Not much beyond running a Twitter account and conducting an AMA -- proving that, even (especially?) on Reddit, the phenomenon of celebrity is far more entertaining than the celebrity, himself.

A lot of redditors really hate rage comics. This is somewhat justified because-- let’s be honest here -- many of them [are really, really bad](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/new/). 

But redditor [Weasel435](http://reddit.com/user/Weasel435) takes the comics and the concept of “forever alone” to a whole new level. His comics are like the depressed love children of image memes and [Johnny the Homicidal Maniac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_the_Homicidal_Maniac).

[Apparently](http://www.dailydot.com/news/rainmeter-denial-of-service-attack-reddit-block/) the problem arose from an open source program the redditor had installed on his computer, [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/).

We reached out to Rainmeter to figure out how this could happen. Here's the email Michael Engard, of the projects development team sent us:

~~~~

Kevin,

After reading the thread on Reddit, it's easy to see how this happened. Rainmeter is able to download webpages, just like a web browser, in order to display the contents in a desktop gadget. Our software gives the user a great deal of control over this utility's performance, including how often it connects to the website to check for updates. If improperly configured, Rainmeter could be made to automatically refresh the page as often as once per millisecond. Many websites would interpret this behavior as a denial-of-service attack and automatically cut off all traffic to and from the offending IP address, temporarily or even permanently.

This kind of problem is rare, but not unprecedented. We've warned authors of third-party Rainmeter gadgets to limit the frequency of their connections. The software defaults to a ten-minute interval between updates, and the author must explicitly override this safeguard in order to achieve a higher frequency. There are some legitimate reasons for doing so - on a local network, for example, where bandwidth isn't an issue - but most authors obey the limit in order to prevent incidents like this one.

Now, I'm sure this person on Reddit had no idea what was going on - he probably downloaded a third-party gadget that was improperly programmed, and I know that the average person does not tend to make a close inspection of the software accessories that they download. But Rainmeter is an open-source platform, and we have no way of reviewing every third-party gadget that gets published somewhere on the Internet. Short of bugs or security holes in the application itself, the user is ultimately responsible for how they use our software on their computer.


Thanks for contacting us about this issue.

On Tuesday, a big portion of r/gaming was out for [Telltale Games](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mbydq/i_let_telltale_borrow_my_jurassic_park_jeep_and/)’ blood. The small company had borrowed redditor Kevin Henry’s jeep. When he got it back, he found $2,000 worth of damages. That’s the kind of stuff most people would take to a small claims court, but evidently this redditor decided Internet mobs were more his style.

So a day before Telltale Games released their latest game, which the company had been working on for over a year, Henry posted his story to Reddit, whipping some members of the r/gaming community into a frenzy. He even posted the name of Telltale Games employees. Nearly 100 people called her or emailed her. One [threatened her with rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mcy7l/today_i_received_nonstop_phone_calls_and_emails/).

But quickly after the shitstorm broke, Telltale Games itself also took to r/gaming, explaining [its side of the story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mceic/about_that_jurassic_park_jeep/). Everyone calmed down.

Of course, next time it would be nice if the calmer minds take over before anonymous rape threats get made.

[Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) is a karmic superhero.

Thankfully the biggest site-specific news on Reddit this week was of a decidedly cheerier sort. Secret Santa 2011 [officially launched](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-prepares-secret-santa/) on Nov. 1. The Reddit-run gift exchange saw 17,000 exchanges last year. That’s easily the biggest gift exchange in the world -- except no one’s ever bothered to make it official.

So this year, Reddit staff are in touch with Guiness World Records folks. If the [official counter](http://redditgifts.com/) at the RedditGifts site is any indication, they’ve already broken the record by about 20,000 people. Take that, Boots UK Limited!

Speaking of r/IAmA, that section’s moderators [established some new rules intent to rein in frivolous and just plain bad content](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jx6b3/changes_to_riamas_rules/).

But in his messages to us, he actually went into a lot more detail about his equipment and bee-fighting history. 

So, for the sake of future duct-tape warriors, it behooves us to post the full interview.

**Even though you lost, you obviously know how to deal with bees and wasps and stinging things. What's your beekeeping experience?**

Actually part of the reason I came up with the bee suit idea is in college I had a summer job working for a company that would remove wasp and hornet nests for free and then send them to pharmaceutical companies where they made some sort of potion out of them or something. Anyway, that was 20 years ago and with a real bee suit. 

It's funny though. Once at that job I didn't zip up my suit properly, got sloppy. A bee got inside my veil and stung the shit out of me. I vividly remember the sound of the buzzing right in my ear and realizing it was inside the veil, and that absolute panic because It takes a while to unzip and get the veil off, so you know you're going to get it. This time, with my home made suit, when I heard the buzzing and realized it was inside, I felt the exact same panic. It was like going back in time. That's why I grabbed the bee spray so fast and sprayed myself. I didn't want to get the shit stung out of me again. And removing a helmet with all that duct tape would take even longer.

**Can you be more specific about your preparations? What was the exact type of weaponry, armor, and liquor you employed?**

Equipment: I used things I scavenged in the basement. I had an old hard hat I got at a garage sale. I realized the metal side panel of an old computer case had a grill that I could see through, but the grill was too small for a bee to fit through. The rest was just lots of duct tape, towels, a heavy coat (which was hot as fuck on a hot night), boots and gardening gloves. Oh and my trusty cheap ass vacuum. I let that thing run for like an hour by the way after I sucked up those 80 bees. They were spinning the whole time. When I finally turned it off the little Terminator bastards were still moving. So I turned it back on and sprayed bee killer in the hose.


Alcohol: I'd drank a six pack while I was making the suit. Then I started putting it on and feeling nervous, like maybe what I was doing wasn't such a good idea. So I wanted something else, but I was out of beer. I had that half gallon of Scotch in my cupboard. I don't know how much of it I drank. I kept chugging cause I knew when I got the helmet on I wouldn't be able to drink anymore. But then when I did get it on, I realized a straw could fit through the grill. I think it was that last shot through the straw that put me firmly in the 'too drunk' category.

**What did you think about Reddit's reaction?**

There are two things I've absolutely loved about this. When I woke up the next morning I had a brutal hangover, a sore throat from the spray, and I was pretty bummed because I totally failed at getting rid of the bees. It seemed like there were more than ever. So after posting this I got a bunch of responses along the lines of 'that was the best laugh I've had in weeks' or 'thanks I was having a bad day and now I can't stop laughing', etc. So that was really cool, that something went from being a failure to being something that made a lot of people I'll never meet smile and laugh. And I don't mind that I'm a bit of the clown in this scenario, my self-esteem can handle that. 

The second thing I love are the funny things people have done with the images. Those are making me laugh my ass off. I especially love the one that looks like a Grindhouse movie poster. Have you seen it? I've already printed it 8x10 and I'm going to frame it.

But first, he's got to conquer r/atheism.

The r/EarthPorn founder created two meme-specific subreddits this week,[ a6theism10](http://reddit.com/r/aaaaaatheismmmmmmmmmm) and [adviceatheists](http://reddit.com/r/AdviceAtheists), in an attempt to corral image memes away from r/atheism itself. The strategy worked for r/pics and r/funny a year ago, but can it spread to smaller subreddits? 

Who knows -- but syncretic is as good a person as any to lead the charge. [He's launched 60 subreddits that now boast a combined subscriber base of more than 100,00](http://redditlist.com/dir/6301/syncretic)0. That's not too shabby. 


**
tl;dr [read our short piece here](http://www.dailydot.com/culture/redditor-puts-memes-their-own-place/).
**


Otherwise, enjoy the full, unedited interview below.


**Why? Do you think memes/rage comics/etc. lower the quality of discourse? Are they inherently bad or just out of place?**


Well, let me start by saying that I do enjoy rage comics and other memes such as AdviceAnimals. The comments in some of these threads can be incredibly thought-provoking and worthwhile. However, there is always a problem in any large subreddit (100,000+) where images, and especially memes, tend to dominate the front page and push other, more in-depth content out. It's just the nature of Reddit's voting system. Memes are quick, disposable content, usually provoking a good laugh. It takes only seconds from click &gt; laugh &gt; upvote. As a result, these types of submissions move up the queue quickly. An article, for example, may take 10 minutes to read. For most people, that means a 10 minute gap in between ""click"" and ""upvote"". You can see how images have an unfair advantage here. I'm just trying to level the playing field.

Now, in smaller subreddits, this isn't an issue. Sure, the top link is usually a picture, but other content like self posts and articles are still visible on the front page, because there just isn't the large quantity of new submissions in a smaller subreddit that there is in a larger one. Users still have a choice about what type of content they want to consume without digging deeper into the subreddit such as the ""new"" or ""rising"" queue. Most people don't bother, and just move onto another subreddit.
Without the support of the mods themselves, who don't appear to be very active recently, memes will never be absent from the front page of /r/atheism completely. However, the night I created a6theism10, 12 out of the top 20 submissions in /r/atheism were rage comics. That's completely unacceptable in my opinion, and most people can agree that's excessive. Reddit is for the most part a democracy, users are free to submit or vote how they wish. I am simply trying to sway public opinion through a grassroots campaign. I want to ""bitch less and do more"".


**As for your experimental subreddits themselves: How have they been working? Has there been a noticeable decline in rage comics featured on r/atheism?**



The first subreddit I created, a6theism10, has been an incredible success in my opinion. We're averaging about 100 new subscribers a day, which is awesome for a brand new subreddit. One thing I've noticed is that most rage comics (if I had to guess, I'd say 60%) are downvoted in /r/atheism and hidden from view of the front page right now. The ones that do well, do very well, usually hitting the front page. However, the vote totals are very conflicted. Usually comics that have over a thousand upvotes have only a few hundred positive karma, meaning a large number of people downvoted the comic. So far, all rage comics submitted to a6theism10 have been doing well, some with many more upvotes than they had in the larger subreddit. I've seen some submissions that had negative karma in /r/atheism reach 20 or 30 karma in a6theism10, because the ""rage hating"" population of /r/atheism doesn't subscribe to a6theism10. I'm hoping that public opinion will eventually sway to the point that many more users in /r/atheism will think that rage comics should stay in a6theism10, and begin downvoting them more often.


AdviceAtheists is newer, and I didn't achieve the same ""buzz"" when I created it that I did for a6theism10, but it's still doing well for a subreddit that is only 36 hours old. 77 subscribers so far, which is about half the rate of growth that a6theism10 has had, but it's nothing to scoff at.


I haven't seen any noticable decline in the memes in /r/atheism, but it's way too early to see any positive effect yet. Let me explain how I have been promoting this subreddit. Every day I check /r/atheism/new and look for any submissions that would be relevant to a6theism10 or AdviceAtheists. I add whoever submitted the image as an ""approved submitter"" to the appropriate subreddit. I also tag them in RES so I can tell if I ever see them again, and if they are submitting to my subreddits or still submitting to /r/atheism. So far, I've added about 100 approved submitters, give or take, between both subreddits, and I've seen a total of two people that have submitted a meme to /r/atheism after I tagged them. I call that a 98% success rate ;)


**Assuming this experiment works, are you hoping to expand it to other, bigger subreddits? Do you think this is important to the future of Reddit? (a big question, but I'm curious).**


I have no idea, to be honest. I hope it will work, but there is no guarantee that it will. I might just succeed in creating two successful meme-related subreddits and the problem in /r/atheism might get worse. Only time will tell. I'm not really active in any of the other ""big"" subreddits right now, and the only one I can think of that has a similar problem is /r/gaming. Deimorz, a moderator of /r/gaming, is trying a completely different approach. He's created a new subreddit called /r/filteredgaming and he runs a bot that scans every new submission to gaming, filters out images and other posts he deems undesirable (not sure how he decided that, excatly), and submits a link to the submission at /r/filteredgaming. It's sort of the same premise that /r/bestof operates on, trying to pick out the best and leave the rest. I'm not sure which approach will work better, really, but I'm interested in seeing what happens in the long term.
I'm really just trying to duplicate what happened to /r/pics and /r/funny with the creation of f7u12 and /r/AdviceAnimals. Anyone who was on Reddit before those two subreddits were created can remember the front page of /r/pics and /r/funny were absolutely dominated by those two memes, it was ridiculous. As f7u12 and AdviceAnimals grew more popular, users started posting there more and more, and it became taboo to post them in most other subreddits (there are exceptions, such as /r/gaming and /r/atheism). For instance, try posting a rage comic about books in /r/books and see what happens. I have several times, as a test, and they were all downvoted immediately.


**Finally: What kind of reaction have you received from other redditors?**


So far it's been great. Users are excited when I add them as an Approved Submitter, because, well, everyone likes to be noticed, don't they? I'm basically saying that I value their contribution and I think they should come submit tomy subreddits instead of /r/atheism. If enough people do this, I think it can bring real change to the front page of /r/atheism. People who hate rage comics love the idea because they will see them less (they won't subscribe). People who love rage comics love the idea because they will see them more (they will subscribe), and their submissions will be downvoted less. I really don't see how anyone can not think this is a good idea, really, especially as the subreddits grow larger and larger, which is going to happen. I don't like to toot my own horn, but I know how to get shit done when it comes to new subreddits. I don't have any doubt in my mind that I can get these rolling in some form or fashion. I just don't know how successful they will be in the long term, and how it will change the front page of /r/atheism, if at all.

1312552344.0,6,self.dailydot,j9uow,"""The web is really only a gift for artists"" -- Our full interview with ""Everything Was Perfect"" artist Zac Gorman.",kmmokai,8,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/j9uow/the_web_is_really_only_a_gift_for_artists_our/,"Comic artist [Zac Gorman](http://zacgorman.com/), creator of the insanely popular “[Everything was perfect](https://dailydot.s3.amazonaws.com/uploaded/images/original/2011/8/4/tumblr-lnxwybnxw71qizbpto1-1280.jpg),” comic recently had a digital sit down with the [Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com). He chatted about his love for video games and how they’ve inspired his art. Our[ story is available here](http://dailydot.com/culture/zac-gorman-video-game-art/). But we wanted to post the full interview below as an exclusive for redditors.

**Daily Dot: For starters, can you tell me a little about yourself. Was art something you were always interested in growing up?**

Zac Gorman: I grew up in Dearborn, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, and I was always drawing. I used to draw on that 8.5 x 11, white printer paper that everybody has laying around, but I have these very vivid memories of my dad bringing home reams of that green and white printout paper from work once in a while, that paper that was really popular in the 80's--the stuff with the holes along the perforated edges--I used to love that stuff, because it was just one long sheet of paper that went on forever. I used to design fairly complicated board games on there. I always loved games of all kinds, not just video games, but when we got the NES though, that's when my life changed forever. It was actually a gift for my older brother, although I was the one who ended up falling in love with it.


**DD: How you got into creating video game themed art? Did you go to college for graphic art?
**

Gorman: Actually, I think my biggest influence in going into digital art was Mario Paint. That was a huge turning point for me. I never actually owned the game myself, but a friend had it, and I used to go over to his house for sleepovers and after everybody would fall asleep, I'd be up all night creating animations and designing stamps. There was something magical about creating art on a screen that just clicked with me. I got my first tablet when I went to Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Mich., for two years after attending community college. I studied illustration while I was there and it was a really great chance to begin to find a voice as an artist. Just being surrounded by other talented artists and concentrating on making art for a couple years was really formative.

**DD: What is it about video game characters like Link that have inspired you? Do you see a little bit of Link in you?
**

Gorman: I think that Link has always had a special place in my heart. When I was a kid and we used to play pretend, I'd always want to be Link (with an occasional Mega Man thrown in). I think there was just something so relatable about him. Maybe it was because the earlier versions of Link depicted him as a little kid. At that point in my life, I was just a little kid faced with this big, impossible world and I think there was a connection there. Link, this little, ill-equipped (at least at first), elf-boy from the forest, has this impossible task set in front of him and he just keeps going, no matter what, simply because it's the right thing to do--I think that was a very important role model to have when I was that age.

**DD: ""Everything was perfect,"" which was a huge hit on Reddit. People were really touched by its innocence and beauty, probably forgetting that it was inspired by a video game.
**

Gorman: “Everything Was Perfect,” like most of the stuff on Magical Game Time, was really just about finding the right mood and holding onto that feeling for long enough to finish the piece. These feelings are there for everybody who loves these games, it's why we love them. With a comic like that, it's really about just finding that sensation that you felt when you played that game for the first time and just holding onto it for long enough to draw the comic. If the feeling isn't there in you when you draw it, people won't respond to it.

**DD: What inspired you to make certain parts of your pieces animated?**

Gorman: The idea of integrating .gif animations into comics was an idea that was quite frankly ""borrowed"" from other artists who were already doing it. I only tried to do it better (or at least as well). My whole approach to it, is that it has to be done in a way that doesn't interrupt the flow of the comic or distract the reader from the illustrations. Hopefully, I'm able to achieve that, although often I feel that I come up short on my own criteria. I suppose it's also about giving webcomic readers something that they can't get from print. There are a lot of downsides to reading comics on a screen, so I figured that I should have fun exploring some of the upsides.

**DD: In this day in age where people are so concerned with receiving credit for their creations, how do you feel when a community like Reddit picks up one of your pieces without necessarily giving you credit?** 

Gorman:  I think that the web is really only a gift for artists. If nothing else, just remember to sign your work and it should come back around to you eventually. Sites like Reddit are incredible ways of finding new work and passing it around, and their audience is massive. The truth is that getting credit for your work isn't always as important as it might seem; the people who want to find you, will find you, and the people who just want to look at it, enjoy it for a second or two and then move on with their lives (most people), wouldn't click your link if it was plastered all over the page. Just keep doing work you're proud of and putting it out online, make it as easy to find as possible and hope for some good reblogs.

**DD: Any advice for aspiring artists?
**

Gorman: I've had a number of people ask me for advice lately, and although I do feel a bit unqualified to give advice, there's one thing that I always say, ""just be a good person."" This isn't just new age, hippie stuff either. You'd be amazed at how much better your ""luck"" is when you go out of your way to be a decent, cool, honest person to everybody you meet either online or face to face. It's probably the most important thing for any artist to remember.

For me, it's always been about just making good comics. Whether they're about video games or not, I just plan on making comics for as long as I can. If I had my way, the rest of my life would be spent splitting time between drawing comics and playing video games, with occasional Mountain Dew breaks.",,False,,t5_2so3f,True,,,True,t3_j9uow,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/j9uow/the_web_is_really_only_a_gift_for_artists_our/,

The subreddit’s purposes is to highlight and mock egregious examples of “bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, trans-phobic, unsettling, racist, homophobic, and/or overtly privileged” comments around the site. Hardly a bad idea. But by doing so, it could be encouraging its members to downvote those very same comments. It may seems like insignificant subreddit drama. It’s not. 

Downvote brigades are a kind of cheating that fundamentally undermine how Reddit works—democratically sorting posts within communities. By selectively targeting certain comments, groups can effectively censor content they disagree with. Reddit admins take this kind of thing very seriously.

For their part, r/ShitRedditSays moderators say they discourage their subscribers from downvoting content linked to in the subreddit. In fact, they say, they encourage readers to upvote nasty comments -- what better way could there be to highlight them, after all?

[Reddit loves small businesses](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/11/calling-all-local-businesses.html). So much so that it’s giving small businesses free ad space this November.

At first, I thought this was a shrewd smart move by Reddit HQ  tap into local advertising money. But Erik Martin, aka hueypriest, assured me this was not the case. 

[According to him](http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-small-business-free-advertising/), the move was less a Reddit initiative than a response to the explosive growth in local subreddits. Redditors themselves continue to lead the way in shaping the site’s growth, and Reddit HQ is following. I think that’s something Martin and co. are proud of.

But, as was shown this week, those lurkers don’t just consume content. Some monitor it to plot big scams.

That turned out to be [a very bad idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ln84v/h_an_apology_w_your_forgiveness_understanding_and/).

Evidently, a group of people have been monitoring that section of the site. They dug up nyan_all_the_links’s personal information and harassed him at work. He’d gotten the game keys under one condition: that they not be traced back to his employer. He fessed up to his boss, and got fired.

One of the recalcitrant scammers later [called nyan_all_the_links and apologized](http://www.dailydot.com/news/gameswap-reddit-blackmail-update/). He claimed the group originally met on 4chan, and then regrouped elsewhere to scheme to blackmail him.

Did the scammers really come from 4chan? At this point, that’s impossible to prove. And it doesn’t really matter, anyway. Reddit has millions of users. Like anywhere else online, it might as well be considered a public space.

And like any public space, you've got to be careful.

Those 80 to 90 percent of lurkers are a big part of Reddit’s continued traffic surge.

Martin [revealed to me](http://www.dailydot.com/business/reddit-monthly-pageview-record/) earlier this week that the site has jumped 30 percent in traffic over the past 45 days. Over the past month, Reddit’s traffic hit 28 million unique visitors and 1.8 billion page views.  

Meanwhile, the site’s two biggest sections, r/funny and r/pics, crept past one million subscribers.

But have you noticed a decline in the quality of content r/pics? Perhaps. But if you take a second glance, Reddit’s largest image hub is looking pretty good.

It’s the best advertisement yet for the idea that strict moderation really can help improve the certain default subreddits.

drawmeasheep:

&gt;The article lost a lot of its punch because it started off by talking about r/anarchism, which has been a clusterfuck of drama for a long time. It's not really a good example to use to illustrate Reddit-wide problems, as it has a rather unique problem in that the fundamental ideology they claim runs counter to the structure of subreddits.
&gt;
&gt;""with a light touch, the community flourishes; with a heavy touch, it turns on itself.""
&gt;
&gt;Depends on how you define ""flourishes."" r/trees is a pretty happy/chill place which makes it immensely popular, but I wouldn't say that r/marijuana has stagnated or degraded because it excised all the stoner comics.
&gt;
&gt;I'd argue that there are subreddits where the heavy hand is directly responsible for flourishing. If your subreddit has a specific goal, then the heavy hand is required. If you want a safe space for everyone's two cents to be heard, that doesn't need as much moderation.

&gt;It's interesting to see Reddit general manager Erik Martin make what appears to be a pure libertarian argument:
&gt;
&gt;""The free market of redditors moderates the moderators. If you don't like the way the moderators are cultivating their reddit then unsubscribe and join another subreddit or even start your own.""
&gt;
&gt;Of course, just like actual libertarianism, this notion sounds great but ultimately doesn't really work. There needs to be a more direct way to dethrone moderators. It's obvious that Reddit is full of moderators who care only about the power and not about the section itself.

We pointed out that both the accounts had a history of Reddit trolling. We made no conclusions about the intent of the people behind the accounts, but when a donation page was launched and real money came into the picture, we thought it important to ask questions. We asked for comment, but did not receive a reply in time for publication.

KILL365 and ohblair, the redditors behind the magazine, took issue with our story. They say it unfairly implied ill intent. They trolled the site because they don’t like what Reddit has become, they say. The magazine itself is intended to highlight the very best of the site. 

On Saturday KILL365 and ohblair reached out to us. Here is their full response.

**

To call KILL365 a troll account would be accurate. But a troll account and negative downvotes is hardly a direct link to ill intention. The question is, how do we see reddit. I'm going to link you to [another thread I made months back](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hd08e/fuck_novelty_accounts_karmawhores_memes_cats/). 


The point is, I'm tired of what reddit has become. I'm tired of seeing terrible jokes, overused memes, easy novelty accounts.. If you go to AskReddit, you'll see a thread with 500 upvotes and 8000 comments. People care more about their voice than reading others. I'm tired of having to go out of my way to avoid the immature content every day on front page. The way the average user thinks has become so obvious, I realized I can have more fun by tricking them, than trying to and argue. With KILL365, I will leave relatively innocent comments or opinions, and either watch people jump on it like a pack of wolves, or in many cases, it will actually start a real discussion.


So, I think the motives behind creating a magazine are absolutely genuine. You can see what we came up with. We're digging up legitimately good original, unique, user generated content. This is in my opinion what Reddit should be more about. Like the cover compared to the content of our magazine, it is a complete joke on the surface, but if you look deeper you can find some great posts. The purpose of the magazine is simply to give more attention to the people who I feel are more of a value to this site than the people reposting reposts from gifdump from 4chan from 2008. The first issue's mock cover was simply to show the gossipy headline nature of Reddit. To call out the ridiculousness. When everyone said they would actually read a reddit magazine, it became obvious to me that a this could succeed, and I took the initiative to launch it how I would like to see it.
If a reddit magazine was made with other intentions in mind, if it focused on what reddit has become today, it would be nothing but an extension of a flawed website. If you focus on good content, it becomes something unique and far more interesting.


The people behind the first issue were myself and OhBlair, and a handful of friends who helped review and edit and proofread along the way. At the moment we have taken on a graphic designer to help. You mentioned 'we asked the community for suggestions and only used one' - We simply decided much of that content was unusable or unoriginal. It did not fit in line with what we were making. Not because we don't value the imput of others.


I thought in your first article, describing OhBlair as a troll was a bit of a stretch. And I don't think because someone posts to /r/circlejerk should be seen as a negative. Like myself, he is someone who recognizes problems with Reddit and made a serious effort to make something out of it.


If you were reading this for the first time and discovered that we were the brains behind it, I don't think you should be skeptical. I would let the magazine speak for itself.


My last comments are about the donation aspect to this. This was a main point in your article questioning our motives. In my honest opinion, what we are making has value to it, creating something far beyond 'stealing content' and 'scamming' reddit. This thing takes up so much more time and effort than we had imagined when we started. We saw the donation link as a way for users to show appreciation and support for what we made. Because at this point, if I decide tomorrow that I'm done making these, the whole thing is done. People are willing to toss a few dollars our way in support. We're not charging a penny, we haven't plugged the donate link a single time. I don't think we're stepping on any toes at Conde Nast. The people who's posts we used had already posted it on a free website, and had also given us permission to feature. This was a very small project to begin with, and I thought it was perfectly reasonable to accept donations from those who were offering. The Reddit team has been supportive and even featuring us in their front page ads.


That said, I chose to take down the donation link because I'm not sure how long I'm going to be willing to do this. If I'm out, the project is either dead in the water or will have to be started from scratch by someone else. If that happens, I don't want people to think their money went nowhere. So while I'm getting absolutely nothing from this anymore, perhaps you will believe my motives were genuine.",,False,,t5_2so3f,False,,,True,t3_jqxeu,http://www.reddit.com/r/dailydot/comments/jqxeu/kill365_responds_says_the_redditors_purpose_is_to/,

It was also a week of controversy.

Is the greatest first world problem of all complaining that someone is stealing all your first world problems? Redditors in r/firstworldproblems and r/skeptic tackled that issue on Monday when a few Reddit sleuths discovered some suspicious tweets coming from @firstworldpain. The[ Internet, it turns out, is serious business](http://dailydot.com/culture/pair-twits-rip-popular-redditors/).

r/beatingwomen came under scrutiny again this week. The much-maligned subreddit is always high on redditors' worst-of list. It’s also usually obscured by a veil of ignorance, but [the subreddit attracted the attention of pretty much all of Reddit on Wednesday, when a post linking to it made it to the home page](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jeokh/these_are_real_women_these_are_real_crimes_make/). Redditors voiced off on the limits of free speech, while others told them (and [us](http://dailydot.com/society/reddit-beatingwomen-misogyny-images/)): [Don’t feed the troll](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jga45/reddit_wrestles_with_violence_and_misogyny/)!

Those controversies were only a small piece of the reddit content pie this week, however.

In r/songwriters, for instance, redditor rotat provided Imsecretlyfapping (whose user name tells you a little more than you want to know about this 16-year-old) with a unique gift:[ the high schooler’s lyrics, turned into a gorgeous acoustic song](http://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/j4gms/im_16_i_wrote_most_of_my_songs_at_15_and_i_am/). We spoke to both rotat and Imsecretlyfapping. [Our piece is available here](http://dailydot.com/entertainment/redditor-turns-rockstar-day/).

And on the topic of unexpected gifts, fantasy author Brandon Sanderson (yes, he of the Wheel of Time and Mistborn series) [swept into an AskReddit thread and bestowed one of his fans with the gift of a lifetime](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j5spj/if_you_were_transported_into_the_world_of_a_book/c29gmic?context=1): A character, based on her, to appear in his next novel. She was more than a little delighted, [she told us by PM](http://dailydot.com/culture/brandon-sanderson-fantasy-reddit/):

&gt;When I first saw the reply I kind of gaped at the screen for a moment. I was at work, so I couldn't do what I wanted to do, which was jump up and down and squeal like the fan-girl I am. I had to settle for texting pretty much everyone I know and tearing up a little when I got the PM reply. I also printed it out and put it up on my fridge. It makes me smile whenever I see it.

Finally, Copo55, [a redditor born with a severe facial deformity called Treacher Collins Syndrome, graced the IAmA stage](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jb9vv/iama_22_year_old_guy_with_treacher_collins/), responding to dozens of questions honestly, frankly, and eloquently. It was an enlightening thread: Reddit, and IAmA, at their best. And Copo55, aka Matt, thought so, too.

This is what he told me by email: 

&gt;You know, it never ceases to amaze me the kindness people are capable of. Not only are humans prone to seeking out flaws and differences but we are constantly bombarded with tragic news every day. So to see people coming out and being nice, not even just to me but to anyone who posted something personal about themselves, was really amazing.

Reddit stumbled into the work week with a gift: Reddit wrapped in an MSWord skin, aka [MSWorddit](msworddit.com). For [some reddit-addicted and work-allergic redditors, this may be the greatest invention ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j4xtk/for_all_you_redditors_going_to_work_tomorrow_i/) (after Reddit, of course). On Monday,[ we spoke with MSWorddit’s creator](http://dailydot.com/news/reddit-disguise-leaves-you-safe-work/). He swears he made the program entirely for the benefit of others. He never browses Reddit at work. He swears.

Then on Tuesday, CNN anchor Don Lemon braved the Reddit gauntlet in an [IAmA](reddit.com/r/iama), wherein [he was asked certain difficult questions to which he responded quite admirably \(and politically\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j6nva/im_cnn_news_anchor_don_lemon_ama/). As we pointed out,[r/IAmA is increasingly becoming a destination for companies that want to promote their brand without seeming to promote their brand](http://dailydot.com/entertainment/cnns-don-lemon-gets-skewered-reddit/). 

Wednesday brought Karma Decay, a new weapon in Reddit’s war against reposts (amount of weapons prior: 0). [We interviewed metabeing](http://dailydot.com/culture/new-weapon-redditors-war-reposts/), Karma Decay’s creator, and [also expounded on the site’s astonishing meta-ness](http://dailydot.com/culture/karma-decay-growing-popularity/). 

Meanwhile, as cranky redditors cheered the launch of Reddit Decay, [they were disheartened by the announcement of Reddit’s Grow a College Subreddit competition](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html). As if the site needs more teenagers, right? But [is this really Eternal September all over again](http://dailydot.com/news/fall-reddit-going-college/)?

That evening, in a quintissentially Reddit-like flurry of activity and optimism, r/gaming spawned a little brother: [r/playdate](http://reddit.com/r/playdate) (our story [here](http://dailydot.com/entertainment/redditors-fight-keep-old-online-games-alive/)). There’s no better way to revive dying multiplayer games with a cadre of redditors, right?

Thursday saw [some nastiness befall the good people in r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j96wa/hello_i_would_like_to_donate_three_pizzas_to/) (link is to original thread; [our summary of events is here](http://dailydot.com/culture/random-acts-pizza-comes-under-attack/)). But they quickly got back on their feet, and [jabberworx started slinging pies like some kind of virtual pizza ninja](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j9dmc/in_response_to_a_certain_deceitful_person_i_would/).

Finally, the week week came to a crashing end [with a major mod controversy that spread from r/favors to r/askreddit to r/circlejerk and to r/metacirclejerk and, well, just about everywhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j8sk9/am_i_being_unfair_or_was_this_mod_just_damn_rude/). We held off on reporting too heavily on this, as it essentially fits part of a bigger story on mod power that we will be running next week. That story will focus largely on the r/anarchism community, which[ saw its own fair share of controversy this week](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=r%2Fanarchism).

The seemingly irrevocable march of [image memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jku3h/going_camping_heres_how_to_stay_clean_and_have_a/) based on image memes based on insider jokes [based on chili and ice showers](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jinex/shower_to_go/) was so terrifying to some that [they committed reddit suicide](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/jlo87/a_thread_where_many_accounts_selfterminate_i_find/c2d5kxn). (A meaningless, act, of course, considering how easy it is to create a new account. But, still: they did lose their karma!)

That kind of predictable dependence on recycling content -- of beating memes into the ground and possibly all the way to China -- is the exact kind of behavior that Reddit trolls love to hate.

But some Reddit trolls seem to have reformed themselves. 

ohblair and KILL365 [launched the first real issue of The Redditor this week](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jmseq/the_redditor_issue_2_august_2011_plus_40_page_pdf/), a 40 page collection of content copied directly from the site. It was a celebration of reddit, it seemed, with the editors claiming it was “a community effort, embracing the community, for the community.” 

Redditors loved it, and didn’t seem to care or notice who created it, specifically: [KILL365](http://www.reddit.com/user/kill365) a legendary troll, with an impressive comment karma nearing -3,000; and [ohblair](http://www.reddit.com/user/ohblair), also a troll of sorts, with a user history that paints a picture of someone with no small amount of disdain for Reddit. 

These two trolls, who sign PMs as one person, both seemed to change entirely one day in July. They’re no longer antagonistic. They’re nice -- and they’ve released a magazine that redditors love. 

All they’re [asking for are some small donations](http://www.theredditor.com).
