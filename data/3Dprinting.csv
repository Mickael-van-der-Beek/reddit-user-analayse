Thingiverse is great, but it wasn't what we had in mind for a 3d printing centered site. We want it to be simple and independent.

By the way, this really is beta. The site may crash or 500 on you as things are still not totally in place. Please do make an account though and help us break it so we can make it better.

Today there're about a dozen 3D printing projects on kickstartr, but only one 3D scanner project (if you search for ""3D scanner"", you'll find 4 projects, and only one of them is a desktop 3D scanner, by CADScan in UK).

I used to work on industrial laser scanners and have a good knowledge of how they work, hardware setup, firmware, USB drivers, desktop software, calibration, etc. On the other hand, the company I worked for build their scanners in-house, so I have no experience about getting them manufactured (cheaply) overseas and imported.

For an initial device, I'm thinking of a scanning volume of 6""x6""x6"" or bigger, using one laser and one camera, with resolution of 0.1 mm (at lower end of scanning volume).

I estimate the cost of a low-end device will be in the $500-$1000 range. Low-end here means one camera and one laser.

EDIT: can anyone give me a rough estimate of the cost of manufacturing and shipping a cheap 3D printer at 1000 and 10000 quantities ? I think the scanner should be cheaper to manufacture than a 3D printer.

Hey everyone, I am a long time lurker of /r/3Dprinting (and reddit in general) and have recently launched a project that might interest you!

The project, called ProtoExchange, offers the opportunity for 3D modelers and owners of 3D printers (such as yourself) to be paid to produce objects!

ProtoExchange exists on a simple bidding platform in which a visitor would request an object. The requested object would be open for bidding by modelers and/or producers. The Visitors would then choose the winning bid and the appropriate bidder would be awarded 100% of the bid winnings (ProtoExchange will not take a percentage of your hard work).

EDIT: In addition, we'll be offering a free 3D model library for users to manipulate, modify, improve, and draw inspiration from! Please check out the video on indiegogo for more information!

Anyways, I can ramble on forever about ProtoExchange, but please take a look at our Indiegogo page (http://www.indiegogo.com/protoexchange)

If you have any questions, please voice your opinion within this thread or over at www.reddit.com/r/protoexchange.

**TL;DR** Started a sweet, free online service to make you some money and gives you access to a free model library - check out the video at the top of this post :)

*Edited for clarity with regards to free model library*

I'm back again with another update about /u/fruble and my website, [bld3r.com](http://www.bld3r.com/) (pronounced ""builder""). Let's see, the big news is infinite scroll... which isn't exactly infinite since we only have about 30 or so objects shared on the site right now, but i limited the front page to 15 per, so you can see it in action. I, on the other hand, can't stand infinite scroll, so i also added an opt out button (you can find it in the user settings section, which is accessible via the user page). 

In other news, we are nearing our 100th user. I haven't had a lot of time to finish much else as i've been away, but fruble has been working stuff and i assure things are improving on the back end as well. My favorite fix is i recently corrected the database typo from when i originally made a entry for ""licence"" instead of ""license"" and it had become pervasive throughout the entire back end.

Our next plan is to remove the ascii-only requirement for .stl's and add allow .obj files to be uploaded as well. That should be done by the end of the week, if not sooner. Also, i'll be looking into some display option so we can avoid webGL if we can. So, if you haven't already, upload a file or share a tutorial. We can use all the content we can get.

(xpost from /r/Reprap)",MakerJuice,35,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1cabkh/just_started_a_less_expensive_uv_resin_production/,"Hey guys. So one of the big hurdles in getting stereolithography printers up and going in the RepRap community has been the cost of resin to print with. Most places sell for $75+/liter, which is way over the price of PLA/ABS.
I just started www.MakerJuice.com to produce awesome resin at a more affordable price. 


Right now I am selling on my site for $45/Liter for my first resin. That's a 40% savings over the next closest guys, and my resin is as good or better than anything else out there. I'm also partnering with several stores and people in the RepRap community to develop the resin printing community even more, so I can lower the price in the future.


My hope is with lower cost resin, and better Laser/DLP printers, we can take DIY 3D printing to the next step. So come check out www.MakerJuice.com. I'll be adding more stock as needed, and you can find me in #reprap on Freenode if you want to talk!

Some background:

As big GoT fans, we were excited to see [throne toilet seat](http://www.etsy.com/listing/104356743/game-of-thrones-inspired-toilet-decal) become successful fan art, and decided to go ahead and design/ produce our own Iron Throne inspired phone dock. In order to emphasize our ‘Do-It-Yourself’ process, we posted a high level [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Iron-Throne-Dock-for-your-Iphone-and-your-mobi/) detailing each step.

That tutorial garnered some bloggers’ attention ([Mary Sue](http://www.themarysue.com/iron-throne-phone-dock/), [nerdapproved](http://nerdapproved.com/cellphones/an-iron-throne-to-dock-your-phone/), etc links), which snowballed until [Wired.com](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/01/game-of-thrones-smartphone-dock/) featured our phone dock in January. We were ecstatic and continued refining the phone dock design, while simultaneously accepting pre-orders.

Yesterday we received this cease and desist[letter](http://imgur.com/x6gkbzB), which brings us back to the fork in the road.. we thought by labeling it as ‘inspired’ it was clearly not attempting to dupe potential customers into thinking this was officially licensed merchandise. Is there any room for negotiations, or is this project canned?

edit:
here is a link to our [Website](http://nuproto.com/) and the [iThrone](http://nuproto.com/iThrone.html) page

edit:
HBO contacted us and they aren't interested in licensing it to us. They say that the charging dock idea has already been licensed to someone else.

edit: 
HBO ask us to take down throne page, the instructable page and pretty much any evidence that this ever existed

SLS printers, laser sintering, is what places like Shapeways use to create finished product quality prints in resolutions as fine as dust.

The patents for this superior system are owned by one company and they are doing a great job at stalling an industrial revolution for the last 30 years. They're technology has been changing so slowly and their machines are expensive and huge. 

No competitors though, they own the tech!

Trying to help local forensic artist identify someone.,ebrake,25,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/17ixa1/i_need_help_converting_a_cat_scan_to_a_3d/,"Since word has gotten around that Im the local go to guy for 3D printing I was approached with an unusual request from my local sheriffs department.

They have a forensics reconstruction expert that does clay modeling on human skulls to help identify the John and Jane Does.  She has such a high success rate that other police agencies have started to contact her about helping with some of their cases.

The problem is that they can not ship her human skulls that is part of evidence on the other side of the country.  So the solution that they have come up with is Resin SLA 3D prints of the skulls.

The other police department had a CAT scan preformed on a skull and sent the file down to her.  The problem is that it is not in a ""solid"" 3D format that the 3D printers use. Its in individual image slices that medical imaging software assembles to create a 3D image.

So Im trying to find a way to convert this CAT scan to a useable .STL or IGES format so that it can be accurately replicated.

Google has led me to: Mimics Innovation Suite http://biomedical.materialise.com/mis

Unfortunately I can not buy the software on their site (dont even know if I can afford it they have no listed prices) and I have received no response to my information requests.

I also came across 3D Doctor software (http://www.ablesw.com/3d-doctor) however they want over $2,000 for the software and I cant spend that much just to convert one file on a non profit job that we are doing for free.

So I thought I would ask the great minds of reddit.  Do you guys know another way to covert CAT scans to a 3D friendly format, or would someone on here happen to have a copy of Mimics or 3D doctor that might be willing to do the conversion?  Im looking for any suggestions here I really want to help them out with this project.",,False,self,t5_2rk5q,False,,,True,t3_17ixa1,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/17ixa1/i_need_help_converting_a_cat_scan_to_a_3d/,

We've implemented almost all of it. Over fifty people signed up for the beta, which is far beyond our expectations for one simple reddit post. So, again, thanks.

Anyway, what's improved: 

* You can now see stl files in 3D.  [Take a look at Mr. Alligator](http://www.bld3r.com/obj/18001?webgl=True) (may not work it [all browsers](http://caniuse.com/webgl), let us know if you're having trouble. Here's one [firefox](http://forum.123dapp.com/123d/topics/how_do_i_enable_webgl_for_firefox) solution). We implemented three.js and WebGL for uploaded models. There are a lot of improvements i want to make to the js here, but it works, and to be honest, i had no idea how to get it working two weeks ago. 

* After a lot of issues, we did finally got naked domains working. 

* Also, there have been a lot of other improvements to things you don't really see, from the algorithm for the front page, to the way blobs are stored, and a host of bug fixes. 

What I'm still working on: 

* The next major upgrade i want to add is Thing Tracker. I'm not super familiar with it, but there was more interest in that than anything else, and it sounds like a good concept. 

* I am also working on implementing a feature that lets you link to an etsy page for models you created. 

* Infinite scroll is coming as soon as we have more content. 

* I also want to make the whole sharing process just a bit simpler.

So, yea, if you haven't, check out the site at [bld3r.com](http://www.bld3r.com/). Please, continue to let us know what you think. We really do take the feedback seriously. If you have any models you want to share, that would be awesome.

I went to the site that has all the currently available 3D printers side by side and viewed all the models.  I really liked the print quality of the UP (before it was Afinia for the USA) but at the end of the day I settled on the SUMPOD because of its build and the ability to CNC with it.  When I purchased the SUMPOD Big Aluminum I was given a 6-8 weeks lead time.  Fair enough.  Fast forward to last week when I just got my box.  Not my printer, a box, with parts strewn all over inside and electrical components packaged in a loose bags with screws and nuts (LCD screen, etc.).

My original intent was to buy a fully functional 3D printer to begin familiarizing myself with 3D printing and then to dig into it and actually build my own second printer.  Now it looks like I will be rebuilding the skeleton of a SUMPOD to something completely different.

Here is a link of the pictures I’ve taken of my currently progress and the mess of parts I have with no materials list/instructions. http://s157.photobucket.com/user/Kahlid74/library/Sumpod.  I’ve found a forum with lots of other people in the same boat as me (http://sumpod.proboards.com/) and I’ve posted a build on there.  The purpose of this post is not to complain about a purchase that has come to bite me in the ass but as a warning to anyone thinking about getting a SUMPOD.

Given that's what I'm looking at, I am fully aware that my current computer will not cut any 3D modeling, since it has trouble with Youtube videos from time to time.  So my request here is two-fold:

1) I'm looking for input from you on which of these printers is a good end user choice; and

2) I'm hoping that you can comment if need by on my *build a PC* post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/16zyy1/build_ready_a_little_out_of_my_element_here_3d/).


As to the first, if any of these printers I'm looking at uses a proprietary filament, and I've overlooked that, please let me know.  That's enough of a strike against it as far as I'm concerned to make it almost impossible for me to choose that given printer.

Ideally, I'd like a kickass set of unique dice. I have been lurking this subreddit for a while - you guys are awesome. Advice would be awesome. 

I want hallow dice that I can get printed in steel. I realize that most people's printers cannot do that, so I am willing to ask local locksmiths and other metalworkers. Still, I'd need a model. That's where the 3D printing comes in.

So with that said, I'm interested in kickstarting the 3D printing movement in my region (Appalachian State University area in Boone NC, specifically). To do this, I'll have to get some hands-on experience, get the word out, and solve the issue of my own means of subsistence. This will be a long, long road, I get that. I have little knowledge of stuff like this, but I intend to learn.

So what I'm imagining is that if I can set up a 3D printer on the street and start printing novelty items for the locals/tourists (for a reasonable price), the idea will catch on. I'll have a suggestion board and all sorts of stuff, begin talking with all the tech-savvy folks in town, and eventually figure out what step 2 will be. To not get ahead of myself, this thread is specifically about step 1.

Yes, I'm doing my own research, but this is also a part of the research, because Reddit is an awesome tool like that.

So here's some of the basic stuff I need to know. 

-What is the best 3D printer for personal use that is a good balance with easy maintenance/reliability, affordability, and the ability for novices like myself to print basic objects as quick as possible?

-What are some of the major issues that you guys think I'll run into as a newby?

-I've noticed a lot of people say ""the novelty runs out quickly, once you print out a couple demo models, it's a waste of money."" I'm not buying that at all. So the question is, what is the best 3D modeling software in terms of affordability and comprehension?

-In layman's terms, What is the case for copyright and all that jargon when it comes to me setting up a company's 3D printer on the street and printing out models? Can I purchase models online and print them without being loaded into an unmarked black van?

-Has anyone had experience or know of some sources that relate to this venture I'm about to go on? I've never heard of an average Joe just hitting the streets with a 3D printer, it'd be interesting to hear of others' successes and failures. 

Thank you guys for helping me out. And obviously, if someone is inspired to do the same, the more the merrier.

I'm starting to feel confident that my review was fueled by frustration and ~~erectile dysfunction~~ my addiction to coffee enemas.  I'd like to thank everyone for your helpful and encouraging words - I have removed Solidoodle from my revenge list.**

I received my Solidoodle 3 last month and my print success rate is about 20%.  This printer is junk, don't buy it.  

About 2 weeks ago I had to stop playing around with it because I ran out of ABS and final exams were weighing down my freetime.  I just finished my finals yesterday so I'll be back at trying to figure out the problem.   

I'll highlight the **cons** as I can't really think of any pros

* The heat bed **will not** heat up to the default of 95 C on it's own.  I've turned it on, watched LOTR The Two Towers extended edition, and returned to about 89 C.  Also note that I have the Printer located in my small office at home with closed doors.  
* The heat bed takes about 45 minutes to heat up to 95 C **IF I blast a [Space Heater](http://www.amazon.com/Lasko-754200-Ceramic-Adjustable-Thermostat/dp/B000TKDQ5C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366132504&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=space+heater) directly onto the heat bed**. 
* 9 out of 10 times the first layer **will not stick**.  I've calibrated the bed like the solidoodle wiki page explains (as well as watching several videos on youtube explaining how to do it) and no matter what, I hardly ever get the goddam first layer to stick.
* On at least 3 occasions, when I did get the 1st layer to stick, the spool jammed up and instead of feeding the ABS into the head, it spit out unused spool through the side of the extruder.  I'll try to get a picture if this happens again.  The ABS that was spit through the side is now wasted (and it was ALOT!)
* Literally **EVERY.SINGLE.TIME.** that the part actually **does** stick, the bottom layer will gradually warp on one side.  For smaller prints (like a 1"" diameter coin, 1/4"" thick) this can be ignored.  Anything larger will ruin the print.  Usually about halfway through any larger print, the part will simply be pulled off of the bed and move with the head and one piece.  
* Support - it's a joke, I've sent a few emails with questions and the replies I receive aren't really helpful at all.  I asked for help figuring out how to get the first layer to stick and after 3 replies I received a link to the wiki.  Thanks support, that's about as helpful as when the Dell Support explained that the only way to fix any problem with my computer was to reformat.  

Oh I thought of a Pro: **it's cheap**.  It only cost me $800 for the biggest disappointment of my life.  If you think about it I could have had a son that would both cost and disappoint me more.

Someone brought in a B9 (SLA printer). The resin stinks and is toxic. Leftover resin can't be reused so every print is 10-30$. After several failed prints (calibration issues ? software issues ? who knows) it went back to where it came from.

So I've been lurking the sub and saw at least a couple people interested in a review. I'm new to 3D printing but I'm willing to answer any questions.

I'm located in California so the printer was shipped internationally. The box came with pressure sensors which were tripped. The only damage looked to be superficial, a piece of the plastic case was broken off. Functionally everything looked fine. 

Its fully assembled which is nice but definitely not ready out of the box. Comes with the necessary screws drivers for leveling the plate and some basic maintenance. Also had their glue, some sandpaper, and a usb stick with their cubex software. I wish it had the hex driver necessary to make print jet adjustments though. Also something .5mm to stick up the jet when jammed would be nice as well.

Support has been awesome so far, they quickly sent a replacement case, under warranty, and respond quickly when I asked for supplemental information that is missing from documentation on removing the case. Replacement case was missing their brand so I think it was sent from the manufacturer. I could check but the box is all the way over there...

Their documentation isn't the best, for example, in order to set the set the print jet offsets you need to print their print jet calibration file which the documentation tells you to download at http://cubify.com/. Thats the exact link. I haven't been able to find it anywhere on the site. Google was able to find it pretty quickly otherwise I would have asked support.

Its a good looking piece of machinery; the owner of the company has it out in front so visitors can't help but take a look. Aesthetically, even harmonically, great but I doubt that's what you all care about.

Setting the Z-gap, aligning the 3 print jets, and leveling the plate shouldn't be this hard though. I may be an idiot but I think our print plate is bowed or at least not flat. Support had me take a few pictures and they're sending a new one now.

The Cubex software is only useful for converting .STL or .Creation files into cubex build files. I'd rant about the lack of features but I'm pretty sure it's not meant to do anything else. I've got to figure out what software to use to design stuff. Oh god, I have to learn 3D design!

I was able to print out a few small things but only in one color. Due to the print plate I'm unable to properly align the print jets, thus the z gap only works on one at a time. Also due to the plate, larger prints come out awkward as the jets push down on the print at some points. I'll post pics if anyone is interested.

One print jet is jammed so I need to do a lot of work on it to get the filament running properly. The steps are in the documentation, I just haven't gotten around to it. 

All in all, I like the thing, it's just been a huge hassle to get running and my boss is breathing down my neck wondering why I'm only printing blue knick-knacks when he wants me to print a bust of his head last week.

They don't even have a ""translation"" list somewhere on their site between their description and the real material.  I found a few, but only by looking at the MSDS for each ""Vague &amp; Bland Name"".

1367967707.0,19,self.3Dprinting,1dw75p,10 Days with a Replicator 2x,strdg99,21,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1dw75p/10_days_with_a_replicator_2x/,"Back in January, I ordered a Makerbot Replicator 2x. Yes, I’m fully aware of the feelings towards Makerbot in the 3D print community, but I was looking for an off-the-shelf printer with dual heads that would print PLA and ABS (especially ABS). Well, it finally arrived (12 weeks delivery vs. the 8 weeks advertised). And the top cover is still missing. Makerbot says that will be another few weeks. I still wanted to see what it could do, so I started printing.

First, right out of the box, in high-quality mode using Makerware the print quality with ABS was far better than I expected. 

I did try using ReplicatorG and while I prefer that it is far more flexible, that flexibility has made it harder to work with beyond the default settings for ABS. Somewhere along the line, it lost the home and limits settings and now bangs into the stops. Bigger learning curve here so I set it aside for the short term. 

So back to Makerware. ABS works great. In fact, many people have a hard time getting their prints to stick to the build plate. In my case, they stick too well and I’ve torn the Kapton tape a few times removing the print (yes, even with a Cricut spatula). Fortunately, I found plenty of Kapton on Amazon.com.

However, PLA has been almost impossible. I spent hours playing with temp and feed settings trying to get PLA to print. The Replicator 2x is apparently optimized for ABS. PLA tends to jam in the feed. A lot. Higher temps didn’t help. Finally after a lot of frustration, I reloaded the ABS and started printing again. This time I tried the medium and lower quality modes. The low quality mode needs a bit of tweaking for sure. The extruded plastic strands wouldn’t adhere to each other, so I have some more learning to do there. Medium quality worked pretty well, but as expected, was medium quality.

I’m now going to go back and start working with the PLA to see if I can get it to work, as well as ReplicatorG to see if I can figure out how to stop the head from slamming into the stops. Then on to dual color prints.",,False,self,t5_2rk5q,False,,,True,t3_1dw75p,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1dw75p/10_days_with_a_replicator_2x/,

1348940908.0,18,self.3Dprinting,10oatn,I need help getting the word out about my experience with a terrible company.  (Botmill),Exsanguinatus,24,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/10oatn/i_need_help_getting_the_word_out_about_my/,"Settle in, guys...  this is going to be a long story.

*TL;DR at the beginning, since this is a long-ass post.  Botmill is a shitty company with shitty customer service and they'll take your money in exchange for a shitty product, then blame the fact that it doesn't work on you.*

January, 2011:  There's something I've been itching to do for a long time; purchase a 3D printer.  So, I look around, and I find a deal on a do-it-yourself kit from Botmill.  Seems like a decent deal:  I don't have to locate my own suppliers for what is effectively a Mendel.  They tell me I'll get everything I need to assemble it, as well as a pound of plastic to work with. Hella fun to build something like this.  I mean, it's like the ultimate in Lego assembly to me.  So I make my purchase.

Almost immediately, my money's withdrawn for the purchase.  They tell me I should have a tracking number by the end of the week.  Takes something like two to three weeks to get my parts.  Lots of emails on my part saying ""WTF?""  When I get them unpacked and attempt to start assembling, I find out that all of the plastic parts are complete shit.  A segment of my email to the company follows:

    I'm only about 30 minutes away, I think, from the address on the boxes that were shipped to me.  AND I'M REALLY MAD AGAIN.
    This is only the third time I've tried to get this problem resolved. The owner, Gil, gave me his phone number to call him if I was still having troubles.  I've left messages, and I've called most of this weekend so far.  So far, no response.  And, oh, yes.  I have troubles.
    When I last talked to Gil, I was told that since my extruder plastic was all bad, I was getting new extruder parts, and assembled extruder, as well as a new set of all the other plastic;  the reason being, if the extruder was that bad, the rest of the parts were probably crap as well.  I was shipped my parts and I got them something like a week later than I was expecting them, and lo-and-behold, I only have the extruders.  The rest of the replacements did not come.  Since I was in Florida this weekend, I figured I'd make it down there to get my as-yet missing replacement parts.
    Nobody's answering the phone, Gil!

A little note to the readers...  Gil's already ominously informed me that our communications are private and should not be posted anywhere.  My words are my own, so I have every right to relay them to whomever I want.  I will at least leave his end out unless heavily paraphrased.

Obviously, I'm trying my best to hold my shit, here.  I'm *trying* to stay polite and reasonable.  The bit at the top about the SAE allen wrenches had to do with the fact that they said the kit included everything required to assemble.  This shit's all in metric.  They never sent a power supply, either.  I didn't think about it during assembly, so I didn't complain about it early on.  In the end, I had to put something together to handle power myself.  They also sent me an additional heated print bed, but there's no instruction on how to assemble it, nor was there any power supply for it, either.

It took ten days, and still no follow up.  I had to contact them *again.*  I was told that the parts I'd originally gotten were all done at a casting company in China, which is why they were shit.  Then they switched to a US casting company, and the parts were still shit...  so now they'd set up a bunch of printers themselves and were printing out parts as fast as they could...  and that I'd have to wait for them.  By this point, it's not mid-March.

Finally.  March 28th comes around...  MARCH FUCKING 28th!  Two months after my money was withdrawn.  Let that sink in a little....  I'm contacted by one of their employees confirming my delivery address and am given a tracking number later that day.

Assembly finally starts.

Different extruder entirely.  That's ok...  I can figure this out.  Turns out I have the hardware for the ""Adrian's Extruder"" type, but the plastic for the ""Wade's Extruder""...  Inconvenient.  More shipping occurs.  Ok, now the hobbing on the bolt that is supposed to feed the plastic is in the wrong place...  Good thing I have a Dremmel!  What a mess...

April 12, and after working on assembly most nights after work/dinner, sometimes until 1-2 am, and the printer's together except for wiring.  I've been in constant communication with their ""tech"" guy sorting out various issues...  In reality, I've had to figure out damn near everything on my own, as they still had pretty shitty assembly information available.  Wiring was highly entertaining, as I had to track down the steppers they sent me online and figure out what wire is supposed to go to what pin.  The information I was given by their support guy was no fucking help at all.

So, eventually, I have everything wired up...  still no power supply at this point, but I'm not concerned with that at the moment.  I'm trying to align each axis and make sure my machine is squared up.  This leads to a great deal of frustration, as no matter what I do I can't keep the print nozzle a constant distance from the print bed while aligning the z axis.  I'm not a machinist, so I'm at a little bit of a loss as to why this would be, since I appear to have done everything correctly in terms of assembly for now.  Several things happen, such as my over-tightening of an adjustment screw on the bed and snapping one of the plastic pieces....  I'm tired, frustrated, otherwise busy in life, and I set the whole thing down for a couple months.  I'm not too worried about it, as I'm pretty sure that once I glue shit back together and get the alignment figured out, everything will be fine.  For now, though, the whole process has been draining.

Fast forward to September.  I've brought the printer home with me to show my dad and request his assistance.  He's done just about everything in life.  He can fix this shit if I can't.  I explain my issues, he looks at the machine for about 30 seconds, then he comes back with a straight edge and some feeler gauges.  Turns out my alignment problems weren't really my fault because the damned aluminum print bed is cupped!  *Cupped!* Almost 25 thousandths of an inch off in the middle.  It's a weekend, and the end of September by now, but I try my luck anyway with an email.  No response.  Only to be expected.  I get the bed decked to within 5 thousandths of an inch of flat for about $40....  investing more of my own time and money on this project.

Finally, I'm down to the brass tacks of this beast.  November, now, and the only easy part of this whole discussion with Botmill takes place.  My extruder's been being really weird, so I go to change out the brass nozzle.  While disassembling it, the thermistor in the heater block just falls apart.  I'm kicking myself in the ass at this point, and contact Botmill.  They kindly ship me out a new, although completely different, replacement free of charge.  Finally, something goes right with them.

December, and the extruder's back together.  I'm trying desperately to get a good print out of my printer.  I've signed up through their website for support, as I figure I'm beyond the need for special assistance...  Things seem like they're going to work, so I'm trying to use the regular channels for assistance.  Two submitted tickets to support and about two weeks later, no one's contacted me back and my support tickets are gone.  Obviously, I'm confused, so I try emailing Gil Mayron again.  I'm put in touch directly with support.

Suffice to say, the printer doesn't print correctly.  Nothing I can do results in proper GCode.  Nothing I can do prevents the plastic from just leaking out the extruder nozzle as soon as it's hot.  I have to make many crazy adjustments to settings such as temperature, since my new thermistor only reports 150 degrees to make molten plastic, and the recommended temperature settings pretty much burn the plastic.  I'm trying to figure this out with their support, but nothing I can get out them seems to do the job.

I use the same software. I get copies of their settings. The GCode produced by the software yields nothing useful.  I try the demo GCode files available...  Nothing ever prints right because temperatures are inconsistent and the first layer of plastic is shit because all the plastic melted out of the extruder nozzle by the time it's gotten to the correct starting position.  The only thing that every printed close to correct was code supplied by Botmill, but even then, the first layer was missing whole chunks due to the leaky nozzle.  The emails between myself and support got on until February.

Fast forward to June.  I've had a temporary room-mate and no room for my disaster of a printer.  He's moved out, now, and I'm once again trying to get my printer operational.  Only now, two of my steppers seize up sold as soon as power is supplied to the printer!  I contact support, get basic troubleshooting advice which, as someone whose worked in computer technical support, is pretty much no help (unplug everything and plug it in again...  Really?).  So I'm still stuck with a non-functional printer.  Just more non-functional than ever.

I make it August 8th, and I'm tired of this thing.  I'm done.  There's no reason for me to keep it anymore.  I email Gil Mayron again and ask for a shipping address to send it back to them.  No response at all.  So, I use the ""Contact Us!"" link on their webpage.  I'm fucking pissed.  I threaten them with contacting the BBB if they don't at least respond to me.  I say that I understand that it's been a long time in the running, but it would be nice if I could get at least a *partial* refund, since I have a long documented stream of issues...  but I'm not holding out on those hopes.  Mr. Mayron finally responds with the most condescending answer possible: ""Other people have gotten our product to work.  No refunds, no returns, no nothing.""  Thus, he implies that all of my whole string of problems are entirely my fault.  *MY FUCKING FAULT.*  Bullshit.

Now I'm mad.  I go hunting for other information and come across whole swaths of conversations on the RepRap forums, starting from around the time of my purchase, where people are having the exact same problems as I am.  Suffice to say, now I'm livid.  I demand a full refund for his shitty attitude and link him the conversations I found on that forum.  Things only went downhill from there.

I may have to look into taking them to small claims court.  If anyone's still reading by this point, I'd love some advice.

I have some plans for the course, and I would love your feedback: 


What I am planning to do is start small, teaching the students how to design and print a useful object for the home (say, a replacement _________), and then build up to printing an interesting object of their own design. The ultimate goal would be to impart the (I think) significant sensation of moving an idea --&gt; to design --&gt; to actual object. I should note that in total the course will only have 15 class hours (5 classes, three hours each). 


The printers the course will use are the Thing-O-Matic, and a printrbot Jr., as those are the printers I have access to. 


The modeling program I am planning to teach them to use is Blender. I think this works for a few reasons:

* All of the computers at the college have Blender 2.5+ already installed and ready to use.
* I think that while Blender has a steep initial learning curve, the eventual payoff is having a full featured and powerful modeling program to play with.
* I am kind of a FOSS guy, and I will always use a Free Software alternative if one is available.
* Also, since Blender can be downloaded and run on their own computers, they can mess around with the software outside of class hours.


I have a reasonable amount of experience teaching a variety of art and traditional printmaking courses, but this is the first time I am teaching an artform where a good portion of the course involves something that you do not touch directly with your hands (the 3d modeling, I mean). So, I would greatly appreciate any input on the course as described, or possible pitfalls to avoid when teaching 3d-modeling and printing!

Does anyone have any data on this?

I'd be very interested in this as I've been thinking about 3d printers as they relate to building human tissue. 3d printers currently extrude material in layers 0.1 mm thick (10^-4  of a meter). A red blood cell has a diameter of 8 µm (8*10^-6 of a meter).  That's a factor of only 12.5 difference. Maybe soon we could extrude human cells like ketchup out of little tubes. One tube per type of human cell grown from stem cells. Allowing us to build rejection-free organs, artificial limbs, better face-lifts for celebrities and more....

If the resolution is doubling every 18 months. Then it would take us 4*18 months=6 years before we could reach this resolution.

First, are hobbyist 3d printers able to print a quality figure with details at a small size (35mm scale, similar size to warhammer figures, something detailed like this http://www.oldgoatgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/GreyKnight40k.jpg but also consider dragons (scales and stuff) and mesh)? If so, which available 3d printers should be used for this?

Second, for printers that could produce details at this level, would the resins (or plastics) used be suitable for painting?

Let's discuss about this, what do you think of the idea and the quality over 3D printed phones cases?",Xspirits,19,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1b4e3g/found_this_project_that_allows_you_to_create/,"Ok I just found this project and wanted to share and/or discuss about it here. I tried to talk about it on /technology but may be it's misplaced?

Anyway, the cases look pretty sexy imho and I think the project worth backing, but again that's my personal point of view. 
Only issue could be they don't have a lot of available colors but well this could be one of the reasons why they are one Indiegogo.

Quality is a big factor for me, furthermore if I look for a smartphone case...

What they say:
&gt;High quality 3D Printed cases with switchable panels
&gt;ALL SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS: It doesn’t matter which device you have, we will have the perfect case for you
&gt;HIGHEST QUALITY: We have selected the best materials and developed a unique way of combining 3D Printing with top quality coating to deliver optimal protection

May be I'm not objective due to the fact I backed the project, but spreading the word could help them and the future of 3D printing to develop. I really hope we'll &gt;have awesome customized 3D printed stuff in a few time... I mean I dream of being able to print my OWN case as I want, anytime anywhere. While waiting for such a solution this is for me the prefect solution so far. Also, the quality seems to be really reliable this time. 

I really am a tech addict/enthusiast and hope we'll be able to create what we want from 3Dprinting.

That's not necessarily bad, it gives us more content, but it can be annoying when someone who isn't engaged in the community posts advertisements constantly. I'd like to remind people that you can [advertise](http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/) to just the /r/3dprinting subreddit.

We're following the rules laid down in [reddits spam policy](http://www.reddit.com/rules/), which I think is a good balance of allowing people to advertise while ensuring they're at least somewhat engaged in the community. Namely

 * NOT OK: Submitting only links to your blog or personal website.
 * NOT OK: Posting the same comment repeatedly in multiple subreddits.
 * OK: Submitting links from a variety of sites and sources.
 * OK: Submitting links from your own site, talking with redditors in the comments, and also submitting cool stuff from other sites.

Naturally I'm going to be a bit more lenient about those rules towards open source projects, they're already contributing to the 3d printing community as a whole. Can't say anything about the other moderators though.

As always, ultimately it's your upvotes/downvotes that determine what content gets seen in this subreddit. Please upvote based on what kind of content you want to see more of.

Making a new account to post about your blog is a big no, it will get caught in reddits spam filter. Either buy advertisements or use your normal reddit account.

I started planning a custom pannier/topbox design in my head and I'm quite happy with some ideas I have. I was wondering if technology is at the stage where I could print my own. I'm presuming the following:

1. I'd have to print it in stages and snap the pieces together.

2. I'll probably need a more robust frame to build it all around, I presume some kind of metal.

3. I'll leave spaces for locks/hinges etc.

4. I'll be sealing and waterproofing the whole thing.

Has anyone done this before, or anything similar? I'm a programmer by trade and far from practical... sadly. Where on earth do I start..!?!? :)

There are machines that can make a key from a brass slug, but no one uses them. I was wondering if someone could create their own key in a 3d printer. 

Not sure of the process, I imagine scanning the key then simply creating it. Create a copy of your own key, then go up to the door and see if it works. Squirt some lubricant like WD-40 directly in the keyway to loosen everything up before you use the plastic key.

Some high security keys are patent protected, if you can provide an up close pic of the key before you start I will tell you if the key you are printing is protected by a current patent(keys are like anything I guess, when the patent expires anyone can create the keyway)

[ This ](http://www.prsnlz.me/maker/3d-printing-a-working-car-key/) works, but if you examine the actual keyway, it is very simple with no grooves.

Ask any locksmith, there is always a key we don't have. Everyday sometimes. We can only haul around so much brass.

It takes 15 mins to heat up the bed, and 15 mins to cool down the bed 3. the prints it makes are riddled with junk along the edges, the bottom is always overextruded and squashed, there is a ton of strands going everywhere. It just produces the shittiest prints ever. 

So, with all that being said. Where do I go from here? Stick with it, try to calibrate it better? Are their better alternatives in the extrusion category, or do I save my pennies for a form labs laser version? With that I would at least get a usable object at the end.

I had so many ideas for my 3d printer, and was able to realize them after learning sketchup and creating a few models, but the end product is always a let down because of my crap 3d printer, at least thats what I'm coming to realize now.

I realize asking 'what's the cheapest bestest no maintenance-est printer' is like asking what car will never break down or what's better, Xbox or PS, but some guidance would be welcome :)

  About me: I use a Windows PC. I'm versed in 3d modeling and design. I'm comfortable building computers, doing some basic hardware modding, etc. but don't know how comfortable I'd be altering/potentially damaging an expensive new toy, so I'd rather avoid something that could be great if only you have to solder in some new components if possible.

  About what I intend to use it for: Practically, for printing out parts for custom display units to be sold for use at conventions, expos, craft shows and the like. For fun, for printing replica props such as the Portal gun or swords and costumes such as Iron Man helmets or stormtrooper armor components.

  My (preferable) criteria:

- I'm comfortable spending around a grand. Obviously the best deal is best, but if I have to go *slightly* higher (read:$100-$200 more) it may be possible. Taxes were not kind this year so that must be my absolute line.

- I understand that at this price range I will not not be printing amazing, finished, polished quality prints. I intend to do some basic sanding, acetone, assembling, painting etc. I don't expect to go from the printer to a sale, rather use it as a tool on the road to a finished product.

- Since I'm using it as a tool in a series of steps, I don't want it to be too much of a hobby in and of itself. I'd very much prefer pre-assembled, I'm not as interested (at this point anyway) in the assembling, calibrating, tinkering side of the experience. I know that it's still in it's infancy in the consumer space and I will be doing maintenance and calibrating here and there, but I'd like as much of a 'out-of-the-box' experience as possible.

- A build area of 40x40x40 feet. Just kidding. Preferably around 8 inches cubed. I plan on printing larger models in sections and assembling them afterwards, but the fewer pieces to deal with the better.

- ABS plastic for durability, heated bed for the ABS. 100 micron resolution.

- I'm in the US so I'd prefer the same for support, shipping, and replacement part purposes.

  I've looked a bit [here](http://www.3ders.org/pricecompare/3dprinters/) but I'd like some real input. So far I'm leaning towards a Solidoodle 3 due to it's build area/price point/construction, the fact that they're located in my state, they've been around for a couple years, and from what I've read they work well with their customers.

  I'm also considering the [Robo3d](http://www.robo3dprinter.com/products/robo-3d-abs-model-fully-assembled) for it's print bed and price, but they're so new...

  And lastly I toyed with holding out for/investing in the [Gigabot](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/re3d/gigabot-3d-printing-this-is-huge) but the price, lack of a heated bed for ABS, assembly, and still being in the Kickstarter phase deterred me.

  So yeah, thanks for any recommendations. I don't really have any brains to pick in person so I'd love to hear your input.",,False,self,t5_2rk5q,False,,,True,t3_1aohkl,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1aohkl/reddit_help_me_decide/,

I found on [this manufacturer site](http://www.lati.com/en/technical_data/chemical_resistance_01.html) that ABS plastic has poor resistance to gasoline.

I'm hoping (but not optimistic) that PLA is gasoline resistant, because I want to build a replacement filler neck for an old truck I have for which the part is no longer available.  Does anyone have chemical resistance reference for PLA?

I work as an machinist engineer in Aberdeen and often have to make plastic components for the Oil industry. These are usually nylon which i believe recently there has been some success in printing this, but I have had to machine ABS before and knowing what a lot of the parts do ABS would be acceptable for some parts I have had to make in the past.
These printers may not be as good as I think they are going to so I guess I wont know till I get one but most of the printers say they can keep accuracy to 0.2 of a mm which is enough for about 60% of the products I've had to make out of plastics.
Failing that I know a lot of the companies I've worked for in the past sometimes get scale models created of their new products and I was thinking it may be a faster way of creating desk size prototypes of offshore products to show off and possibly sections of equipment for training purposes ext.
Finally for giving a material specification for the product I was thinking each time a product is printed I could print a tensile strength test specimen at the same time, test it and give the results. 
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated I may just be dreaming but It would be good to see peoples thoughts on this.

I thought I would pass along the keys to success (at least with my printer.)

1. You do NOT need a heated bed, Garolite LE works perfect, almost too well.  I've printed micro models and near full bed prints with perfect adhesion and no base warping.
McMaster Carr PN 8474K141, 8474K151, 8474K161, 8474K171)

2. Turn off the Rep 2's cooling fan, with ReplicatorG its under the Cool tab, uncheck 'Turn Fan On at Beginning'.

3. On the Replicator 2 print at 248C. This is the correct temp for the best layer adhesion on this printer with Nylon 618.

4. To account for the strings you need to change 'Retraction Distance' to 6mm (under the Dimension tab in Skeinforge settings), also change the 'Extruder Retraction Speed to 40'.

5. Change your Preheat temp to 248C as well under the printer's Info and Settings menu.  This is for loading and unloading.  Remember to change this back when you go back to PLA.

6. It is highly recommended that you upgrade your extruder to one of the spring tension models from Thingiverse.  This makes a world of difference for Nylon AND PLA.  I have not tried printing Nylon with the stock (delrin plunger) extruder.

That patent basically involves increasing the z-height resolution of an object by only partially curing subsequent layers, then curing THROUGH the current layer. This is to overcome a limitation in stereolithography wherein the minimum feature height is a function of the light wavelength, penetration depth, and material's ability to be ""spread"" to make another layer. Maybe the patent summary says it better:

&gt;A method and apparatus for making high resolution objects by stereolithography utilizing low resolution materials which are limited by their inability to form unsupported structures of desired thinness and/or their inability to form coatings of desired thinness. Data manipulation techniques, based on layer comparisons, are used to control exposure in order to delay solidification of the material on at least portions of at least some cross-sections until higher layers of material are deposited so as to allow down-facing features of the object to be located at a depth in the building material which is equal to or exceeds a minimum cure depth that can effectively be used for solidifying these features.&gt;

From reading the patent it just seems as though they could set the layer heights to the MSD (minimum solidifiable depth) to skirt around this patent with software(which would mean reducing max resolution until the patent expires in 2020).

I got all the parts to put the electronics together, and I'll be doing that this weekend. I have occasional access to a Makerbot that I can use to print the printable parts, and soon I'll be ordering all the mechanical parts.

But, the more I look around at the things people are making, I don't see anything that really blows me away - at least not from a practical standpoint. Are hobby-level 3D Printers really just for making toys, baubles, and the occasional bottle opener? I wanted to use this to build custom parts for future projects, like small electronics enclosures or parts for a quadrotor copter. Is that unrealistic?

So what can I really expect from it? I'm still planning on building the Mendel, but if I can't really use it for anything practical I might just sell it after I finish and play with it for a little bit.

Any input is appreciated. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2rk5q,False,,,True,t3_xtr9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/xtr9p/is_it_worth_it_to_make_a_reprap/,

I've been waiting for printers to get close enough to ""plug-and-play"" that I would feel comfortable using them. That said, I do tinker, and I know my way around technology fairly well. 

My question to you guys is... Which printer is right for me?

I've been looking at the Ultimaker and the Replicator, however, Google doesn't yield many results for consumer level 3D printers, so I could be missing a great alternative.
If you guys would help me out here it would be greatly appreciated. I could see myself using this quite frequently in school to check out my designs, impress the teachers, as well as better understand my designs by ""using"" them or allowing those around me to test them.

I am, however, not rich so anything besides a consumer level product is out of my range. I wouldn't want to go higher than the price of the Replicator with dual extrusion ($2100), but that doesn't mean I want to spend that much either since this will be mostly a Christmas present/student loan purchase.

Thanks for the help guys! I try to research but with the technology being fairly new at this level its hard for me to even know what to search that won't instantly bring up the Replicator.

So, I've spent an exhaustive few nights researching every single 3d marketplace site that exists and uploading 3 models to each of them that I thought were worthy. 

The models:

* Star Vase - a simple vase. Price: $0.99
* Nexus 7 Stand. Price: $0.99
* Guardian Catapult: $2.99

These prices seem to be way lower than what most people charge ($45 for a vase desgin?!?!?!), so hopefully that leads to increased sales. 

The sites that I submitted to:

* http://3dburrito.com/
* http://3dlt.com/
* http://www.layerbylayer.com
* http://3dprintingmodel.com/
* http://www.ponoko.com/

If I can bitch for a minute, it was a real pain uploading to all the sites, as everyone wanted it in different formats, picture styles, tags, categories, etc.

The sites that I did NOT submit to:

* cubify.com - only does physical models
* shapeways.com - only does physical models
* fabme.it - does not accept models as far as I could tell
* azavy.com - too small
* createthis.com - too small and poor quality models
* cuboyo.com - too small 
* grain3d.com - too small
* turbosquid.com - not 3d printing oriented
* cgtrader - not 3d printing oriented
* grabcad - not 3d printing oriented

So, I plan to wait 30 days and then post again on Reddit and give a summary of how much I made on each site. If anyone can personally vouch for any of the 'too small' sites I listed (i.e., either you work there, or you've bought or sold models successfully) please let me know and I will consider uploading my models there. 

If there's any other suggestions I'm open to them. I'm not expecting to get rich, I'll be surprised if I earn more than $10.
