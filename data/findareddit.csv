I'd like to share my story, get advice, and hopefully find someone who can help it take off and make a difference in people's lives.",SFTGFOP,58,20,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/1hrj6p/i_built_an_app_to_fight_rape_id_like_to_share_my/,"I'm just going to give the whole post here in the hope that someone can help me put it in the right place. I've spent a lot of time working up the courage to post this, and I want to make sure that I don't waste it. I can change it somewhat for the format of a suggested subreddit.

I built (hired a team to build) an iPhone App, RealHelp. Originally the idea was to build an app to address campus rape, but the end product ended up with a lot more possible applications. Essentially here's how it works: 
1) You set up a contact list. 
2) You determine who gets what level of alert, (red, orange, yellow, blue) which direct the recipients to how concerned about you they should be. 
3) In the case of a situation where you're alone and threatened you slide an alert button and it sends push notifications; and backup emails, facebook messages, or facebook posts to everyone specified on the list. Each message explains that you're in trouble and links them to a live feed of your location on a map, streaming audio from your phone, and any pictures you might take. Responders with the app can even chat with you and each other to coordinate. Anyone who misses the event can still click on the link for the archived audio, pictures, chat, and location. 
  Essentially for rape prevention purposes, which usually involve an acquaintance, one button and you can confidently say ""All of my friends now know where I am, can hear everything we say or do, and now thanks to this picture definitely know that you're here with me. I'm leaving, and you're getting out of my way."" I am neither a rape victim or a rapist, but my feeling is that a few dozen witnesses who care about you would act as a very solid deterrent. Either the aggressor backs off and plays like it was all a big misunderstanding (maybe it was); or there's a recording of them victimizing someone floating around haunting them forever, maybe they end up going to jail, and maybe an outraged friend gets there before the police. 

As this thing evolved it became clear that it may have more uses. Pretty much anywhere someone might be in trouble because they're alone and vulnerable, this could help. 

Long story short, the app works. It's free for the iPhone, and it works beautifully. It can easily stream an alert in real time to dozens of contacts at once. My developer never quite got the Android version stable enough for me to release. The audio is fantastic and you can really pick things up at a distance. The problem is that so far I haven't been able to build up a user base. 
  One of the big problems is that RealHelp has no fulltime employee, it just has me. Since creating it I've gotten married, had two kids, and still have a full time job. I have poured tremendous amounts of time and effort into the design and promotion of the app, but also spend months at a time not pushing it.
  The other problem is a lack of traction. I'll admit that I'm not good at persevering when I don't see results. My initial assumption was that, with all the rape awareness on the web, this would be a ""build a better mousetrap"" scenario. Ultimately though, people who raise awareness of rape issues online didn't seem all that interested. Some pointed out that creating a tool that could prevent rape was problematic because it raised the expectation that women should have to protect themselves. I also joined the Apps Against Abuse Challenge, but Circle of 6 stomped me, despite having what looked to me like a significantly less powerful app. Still, they haven't risen to the user base that I think something like this needs to make a powerful impact. I've since tried some press releases, but they've mostly been ignored. Right now I am not sure what direction to put my effort into to get results.
  The fact is, RealHelp haunts me. If it were a shitty app, soundly beaten by a now vastly successful competitor, or Facebook built the functionality into their app (they could easily); then I'd be okay just scrapping it and moving on to new attempts to change the world for the better. I still think that it could do a lot of good, and I feel pretty guilty for letting it flop. 
  Honestly, I don't know where to go from here and I'm looking for advice, help, or even someone with the resources to help it take off. I would kind of like to sell it or give it away at this point. Cash-wise I've sunk a new luxury car's worth into it, but I would be so happy to see it succeed under someone else so long as it succeeded. So any insights, advice, guidance, or offers you can give me will be well received. I'll also gladly answer any questions. 

TLDR: Built an app to fight rape and abuse. I dropped the ball on promotion and it didn't go anywhere. It works though, and I'd like advice on what to do with it.

2. Create a notepad file of everything you remember about the subreddit (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)

3. Try and find the subreddit through people you remember posting/commenting there (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)

4.  Search for it using Reddit.com's Reddit's search


5.  Look through the sidebars and FAQs of related subreddits

6.  Searching through Reddit threads and comments

7.  Google it

8. Find the subreddit through part of the subreddit name (Using subreddit explorer and RES)


9. Find the subreddit through tags or subjects (Using Metareddit, Subreddit Finder, or a spreadsheet

10.  Find the subreddit by looking at a list sorted by activity level/number of subscribers etc...  (through Reddit list, Stattit and Subreddit Finder)

13.  Asking for help on a subreddit

14.  Create it

****

****

**`1.`  Look through your bookmarks/browser history (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)**

Check your bookmarks and browsing history if possible, it might be in there.  Even if you're sure it's not, if you're on the same browser and the same computer, give it a try, you might get lucky. 

****


**`2.` Create a notepad file of everything you remember about the subreddit (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)**


Type down everything you remember about the subreddit in a text document, and if you remember something new, type it up.  (Type of Reddit, description, possible things it might have been called, post titles etc...)  This may help jog your memory, at the very least it may help you find it using some other methods. 

****

**`3.`  Try and find the subreddit through people you remember posting/commenting there (if it's a subreddit you've been to before)**



Do you remember anyone that posted or commented in the subreddit regularly, by their full username?  If so, you may be in luck.  Go to their user page by typing in their username after the following URL, with no spaces before or after, and hitting enter  http://www.reddit.com/user/  

Once there, scroll through their pages and see if you can spot the desired subreddit.  If you can't, or if it's too tedious, there may be an alternative.

Go to [metareddit.com](http://metareddit.com/), click the tab named [""stalk""](http://metareddit.com/stalk) at the top of the screen, [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/D76Y0.png), and type in their reddit username in the box on the left [pictured here in red](http://i.imgur.com/JQpX7.png), and click the button marked stalk, [pictured here in blue](http://i.imgur.com/JQpX7.png).   

Using Se7en_Sinner as an example, [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/6t3Uc.png)  we can see that he/she has posted in advice animals, dexter, funny, gameofthrones, gaming, gifs, harrypotter, iama, leagueoflegends, pics, rocketsinmybutt  and trees.  (Note that it only shows the subreddits that the user posts in most, not all.)

If you can't find it either of those ways, you may want to send the user a private message simply asking them if they know the Reddit you're thinking of.  To send a private message, either go to their user page and click the link named ""send message"".  [Pictured in here, again using Se7en_Sinner as an example](http://i.imgur.com/697XC.png).   

Alternatively, click the envelope in the upper right hand corner to go to your messages [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/3aGoJ.png), click
the tab in the upper left marked ""compose"" [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/DTu6v.png), filling out the form and hitting send pictured in red. [Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/C8Jj5.png)

****


**`4.`  Search for it using Reddit.com's Reddit's search**


Using either part of the subreddit name that it may contain or a subject (such as cooking, or science), search for it using the Reddit.com Reddits search.  

To get to the Reddit.com Reddits search:  Click [edit](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/) in the top right of the screen [(picture of it's location)](http://i.imgur.com/MENFA.png). 


To get to the Reddit.com Reddits search if using RES with default settings: Click the plus mark at the top right of your screen, [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/PYgpH.png), a box should pop up, click the link [edit frontpage subscriptions](http://www.reddit.com/reddits), [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/gzni2.png). 


Once there,  if you remember words that were in the description/sidebar or that might be in it, type it in where it says ""ready for something new? subscribe to some new subreddits."" [Pictured here surrounded by a red box.](http://i.imgur.com/yL28u.png), and wait for suggestions to appear.

You may also type it in where it says ""search subreddits by name"". (A bit misleading since that's not all it does) [Pictured here surrounded by a blue box.](http://i.imgur.com/yL28u.png) and press enter.

**`5.` Look through the sidebars and FAQs of related subreddits**

For example if you search for a subreddit about robots go to /r/Technology and look at its linked subreddits on its sidebar. Also some subreddits have a menu bar on top [like /r/Futurology] and some a multi-link, in those multireddits you can often find the one you search.

Also there are FAQ with collections of subreddits, for example if you're looking for a music subreddit go to /r/music and view it's FAQ that is linked on there, it got hundreds of subreddits categorized.

**`6.`  Searching through Reddit threads and comments**



There are subreddits just for submitting subreddits such as /r/redditlists, /r/multireddit, /r/weeklyreddits, /r/subredditoftheday, /r/redditdayof, /r/newreddits and /r/obscuresubreddits.  You may wish to search through them for words describing your Reddit or part of the reddit name.  

To search a single subreddit, simply type in what you wish to find in the grey box in the upper right hand corner of that subreddits screen, and a box should appear with a check box, click it to search just that subreddit.  [Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/ExBfS.png) 

For more advanced features, click the link that says ""advanced search: by author, community..."" which will expand.   For even more, check out the [search FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/search)  

Alternatively, you can just search all of Reddit, hoping that someone commented/submitted your subreddit and it pops up, though this may be a slim chance.

[List of Subreddit lists and multireddits](http://redd.it/13fazj)




****

**`7.` Google it**

Simply go to google.com, and search Reddit through that with `inurl:reddit.com` or `site:reddit.com` for the subreddit category you want, a description that it may contain, or part/all of it's name.

****


**`8.`  Find the subreddit through part of the subreddit name (Using subreddit explorer and RES)**


If you have an ideas on what a subreddit that you're thinking might be called, you might try [the subreddit explorer](http://joelriley.com/subreddit-explorer/).  Simply type in what you think it may contain, with no spaces before or after, and if it finds any matches, they'll instantly be shown and highlighted, as [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/oq8ec.png).

If you think the subreddit you're trying to find *starts* with a word/letters/numbers and have [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com), there's a similar feature for it.  Go to any thread that you can comment in and type in /r/find (replacing find with what you want to search for.) with no spaces after, and wait.  A box of suggestions should pop up if RES has any to offer.  [Example picture](http://i.imgur.com/IEyFi.png)

(Note, that RES will *only* find subreddits that start with what you enter, unlike subreddit explorer which can start with it, contain it in the middle, or end with it.)

****

**`9.` Find the subreddit through tags or subjects (Using Metareddit, Subreddit Finder, or a spreadsheet)**



Can you think of the general subject or any tags that may be associated with the subreddit you're thinking of?

If so, head over to [metareddit](http://metareddit.com/) again.  Click the tab labeled ""reddits"" in the upper left, [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/e179I.png), and click the relevant tag if there is one.  (The larger the tag, the more subreddits it has.).  

If you don't see it, you might try clicking one of the other sections near the top, [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/9O3HJ.png) that most accurately describes the subreddit you're looking for.

If you can't find the proper tag, you might try using metareddits search;  simply click the search box on the upper right of the screen, insert your search term(s), and press enter.  [Search box pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/xjDQ4.png)


A somewhat simular site, [subreddit finder]http://subredditfinder.com/) also uses tags.  Simply go there, and scroll down, looking for the tag that best describes the subreddit you want.  If you don't see the tags, click the button labeled ""subreddit tags"" [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/ho6MJ.png)


There's also this [spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?key=ttpCnxB3rDcEbGTxSi9CBFw&amp;hl=en#gid=0), created by /u/Wordslinger1919.  It's not massive, but it contains many of the most popular subreddits, and is  sorted fairly well.  


****

**`10.`  Find the subreddit by looking at a list sorted by activity level/number of subscribers etc...  (through Reddit list, Stattit and Subreddit Finder)**


You might try looking for it on [redditlist](http://www.redditlist.com/), [stattit](http://stattit.com/subreddits/), or [Subreddit finder](http://subredditfinder.com/).  

You may also try using the keyboard shortcut CTR+F, and trying to find all or part of the subreddit name you think it might be, or, if it's a subreddit you've been to before, finding about the proper amount of subscribers it had and scrolling up and down on the proper list.

Also, there's the [List of Subreddit lists and multireddits](http://redd.it/13fazj)

****

**`11.`  Find the subreddit by looking through a Reddit's directory/map. (through Subreddit suggester, pictures..)**

If you know the general category the subreddit you're looking for is in or would be in, you might try [Subreddit suggester](http://www.pearltrees.com/subreddit_suggester).  

Simply look for the bubble with the category that best describes the Reddit you want, clicking the bubble itself to go to a separate map of those reddits.  You can also hover your mouse over the bubble, then click the + that appears to expand them within the same image. [Picture showing this](http://i.imgur.com/PeYyr.png)

[There's also this picture that is similar, but not click able](https://hdevalence.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/routput2.gif).



****

**`12.`  Go there and hope it exists**

Put simply, type in Reddit.com/r/ in your URL bar, type in random things you think the subreddit might be called, and press enter, seeing if it exists.  You may get lucky, or squat.  




****

**`13.`  Asking for help on a subreddit**



If the above steps haven't helped, you could try politely asking an appropriate subreddit for help finding the subreddit.  Start with /r/findareddit, and if they can't help you, /r/tipofmytongue, and last but not least, /r/TOMTcoldcase (only if it's been at least 24 hours since you posted in /r/tipofmytongue)

Before submitting to /r/findareddit however, you may wish to look through [the list of most commonly suggested and discussed subreddits on findareddit](http://redd.it/13e1rb)

And while you're waiting for an answer, it wouldn't hurt to help a few others in need if possible. 


****

**`14.`  Create it**

If nothing has come up, and you've tried everything, it might be time to create the subreddit yourself.  Click the ""create a community"" button that can be found on most Reddit pages, or [here](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/create).  If you do go this route, this [list of subreddits for mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/weeklyreddit/comments/xpho4/week32_july_30_aug_5_moderators_special/) may be of use to you.  And if you ever do find the subreddit after creating your own, you always have the option of redirecting people to the old one.

Last year, I started therapy and as of February of this years, things started to turn around. I'm happier, more assertive, and no longer hide under the covers about problems in my life. I've lost nearly 20 lbs, I'm kicking ass at my job, and I'm starting to meet people again.

The only problem is that my apartment is still horrible. Whenever I try to think about cleaning it, I get overwhelmed. It's not just me; it's a cheap, shitty apartment that is above a basement that flooded three years ago, with old/cheap appliances. The kitchen sink leaks a bit, there is grout in the bathroom, it's just not nice. But I didn't do any of the stuff required to combat that either.

So, any suggestions for a subreddit where I can get some advice on organizing and cleaning my apartment?

A tree was planted in the name of a woman who died of cancer. Her and a large group of her friends who had lived in this city for most of their lives went through the entire legal procedure for the Dedicate a Tree program in the city. The location was picked by the Parks and Rec dept. The tree had a small and expensive plaque placed around its base and many of her friends and family (including her 3 sons) celebrated her life when that tree was planted. 

Without any consent to the Parks and Rec dept or the group of people who paid for the tree, a local organization removed the tree. The Parks and Rec people investigated the issue and found out which organization it was and ordered that the organization pay for the original and a replacement tree. The second tree was forcibly removed by orders of the councilman, at the request of this same organization. We were told by this councilman's office that it was removed because plaques are not allowed on trees. If this was the case, then couldn't they have merely asked the Parks and Rec dept to remove the plaque by itself? And if this is true, then why did they remove the second tree? The second tree had no plaque. 

The event for the planting of the first tree was the last family event that the woman's father was able to attend before he died 2 weeks later. That event and first tree was extremely important to all of us. **I want to know, what can I or should I do? I'm planning on pestering the councilman and the president of the organization so far, but it is doubtful that this will be enough. I am trying to get as many friends and family to do the same. Do you think this is something that I should try to contact the media for? Should I put up fliers shaming the organization and councilman?** 

This organization is supposedly interested in the location's 'beautification' which to them apparently means to remove trees. I know this sounds like a first world problem, and it is, but I imagine being one of her three boys who wants to visit an area that was supposed to be dedicated to his mother and instead, there is an empty plot. That empty plot is there because the organization, that is affiliated with half a dozen yacht clubs in an affluent area, found a way to take away the beautiful tree that existed there before.

Here is my situation

This maybe a somewhat long explanation, so here it goes.

I am 20 years old (Male) and I have a sister who is 21 years old (obviously female). 

I am employed at McDonald's and have been for 3.5 years. I also work for my dad's business. My sister doesn't have a job and could care less to get one.

 I live with my parents and my sister ""lives"" her boyfriend. She only comes home when she needs stuff from my mom, dad or myself. She is under my parents insurance and drives my dad's car only when she needs it for ""interviews"" until 4am.

My sister always says she is applying for a job and we all know she is full of shit. She waits for government checks and uses my mom's money by other asking for it or taking without asking.

She sometimes steals my money in my room, which I keep under lock ever since $300 went ""missing"". She blames it on her ""friends"" which change every week because they are all scumbags who do drugs and party all the time.

My sister is the most frustrating person on this planet and no matter how many times we confront her she is still an asshole to everyone. She steals from my parents and myself. She smokes and uses this money to buy cigarettes and party. 

My parents as well as myself have talked to her, but my parents never seem to punish her severly enough. And just now I realized she stole $50 from my room. I am so fed up with her shit and can't take it anymore. 

One more thing, I live in Ontario, Canada ;)

I need your help to get revenge on my asshole of a sister!

If you have any questions about my situation, please ask me anything that may help you devise a perfect revenge.",,False,,t5_2sey6,False,,,True,t3_1ijiru,http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/1ijiru/subreddit_for_getting_help_with_revenge/,
