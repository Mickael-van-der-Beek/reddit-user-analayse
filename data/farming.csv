On May 7th, the owners awoke to find their barn engulfed in flames. Despite all of their efforts, they were unable to save their animals. They lost horses, pigs, cattle, sheep, ducks, chickens, and lambs. Their barn cat and a chick (now named Lucky) were the only 2 animals to survive the blaze. Their insurance will not cover the full cost to rebuild. Can we show them a little love? 

 A fundraiser has been set up for the farm here: http://www.giveforward.com/darthiafarmphoenixfund

If you donate, and are a fan of writer Kristen Britain, then you can submit your receipt for a chance to win prizes (signed copies of books, a meeting with her, etc) here: http://www.kristenbritain.com/news.html

Several cases so far has set this precedent.  So Monsanto, if they wanted to, could run trucks through small town America spraying their genetic pollen in the air with the goal of infecting crops on noncustomers and shake them down for money.  Cause if they are not customers, fuck them, we'll get money from them anyhow.  This is a deeply flawed state of liberty for our farmer citizens.

As the law currently stands, Monsanto's product can contaminate your crop and they get to sue for damages.  The FBR should negate intellectual property rights of an entity if it is found that their product (by way of natural means) damages your property.  This would mean that the burden of proof would be on the accuser (Monsanto) and not the farmer.  Monsanto would have to prove the farmer intentionally planted their product.

I had read some papers by Dr. John Ikerd at Univ. of ~~Illinois~~ Missouri that sort of gave me some hope that we could actually turn a little profit from our venture. He wrote a [series of papers on small farms](http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/default.htm#Small Farms) and encouraged small farmers to find niche markets. I can't find the exact quote, but in one paper he said a 10 acre farm with careful planning and niche market selection could bring in an equivalent profit to a 100 acre farm that might deal with a sole product (corn, wheat, etc.). While I don't know how true that may be, it IS a bit of an inspiration. I'd love for my fiancee to quit her day job so she can do this full time, and those papers give me a bit of hope!

Here's some of what we do sort of outside of what we thought was ""normal"" (such as processing poultry and raising the sheep) -- I'd love to hear what you might be doing!

* Ground, raw poultry &amp; rabbit for pet food (laws are too strict to process rabbit and quail for human consumption)
* Breeding silkies, ducks, and quail for sale / Hatching eggs for sale
* Herbs for local distillery (planning for next year)
* Hops for local homebrewers (planning for next year)
* Blown eggs for crafts (Ukrainian wax dyeing, or something?)
* Feathers for crafts (still working on this)
* Rabbit pelts for crafts (still learning to tan hides ...)

The pet food has been a winner for us. We sell it for just as much as we would for people food and I sell out as soon as I let people know I have it in stock.

We also sought out some ethnic markets for our regular products -- I have a fellow from Vietnam who buys every duck egg I have in stock. Apparently they're hard to come by! There seems to be some interest from them in buying live meat birds, which would be wonderful (especially the ducks, since they're a pain to pluck).

We do this all on 10 acres while still keeping our day jobs. It's a lot of work, but we love this kind of stuff and look forward to our nights and weekends.

So, any of you out there with a small farm business who found an interesting way to turn a bit of a profit, besides the sort of ""usual"" things? Care to share your odd little side projects? I'm hoping we can all share and maybe help one another out with brainstorming!

and i started thinking about how google would actually view farming. the matrix of hunger, abundance and labor is a data distribution problem, really. so how do you bring the people to the food and vice versa?

imagine 20-50 small/tiny horticultural plots distributed across a town (or the google campus) ranging in size from a half acre down to a single plant or tree. each geotagged with data on what's what, when to harvest, processing and cooking instructions, a record of fertilization and weeding. 

make a mobile app that tells you what food is growing around you, planted by whom, maintained by whom, what food near you needs harvesting or weeding, gamify it obviously, leader boards for most food planted, most propogation, bonuses for importing new species and propogating successful plants, starting new plots, best weeder, most food given away...

make a distributed flagging/advertising system for help-needed requests, essentially food-available-for-work notices (instant 100% employment). 

the app design is a massive, google-sized project, but we'd also need to start with a substantial variety of plots started. tagging local public mature fruit trees is one easy step (theres a public-park food forest in asheville that would be perfect), also community gardens, but starting a couple-few dozen tiny 5x5 plots in public parks would be the perfect way to get the ball rolling. 

your standard row-crop agricultural model would perform poorly for this. what this would reward is distributed horticultural plants, perennial vegetables and herbs and food trees - permaculture essentially. plants that will take care of themselves pretty well, and give a bounty to the patient.

1347582842.0,23,self.farming,zunrg,Breaking down the numbers behind Livestock Antibiotic use.,Out-of-Doors-Man,24,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/zunrg/breaking_down_the_numbers_behind_livestock/,"I've read that 28.8 million pounds of antibiotics are sold each year for agricultural use and this constitutes 80% of antibiotics use, but would like to drill down into the data.  I can't find the specifics anywhere. Googling only takes me to fear-mongering NYT articles with zero specifics, only calls to burn rural America and farmers at the stake.

You see, I am a cattle rancher and have a few pens which you could call a feedlot.  I selectively use antibiotics on a very very small scale (think ounces per thousand) That shit is expensive!  One mile east of me is a large production beef feedyard (50k head) and they do not bulk administer antibiotics either (for disease or growth).  Knowing this I am having trouble wrapping my head around this 80% number. 

I suspect that it might be pork and chicken indoor confinement production that consume the bulk, but wanted to get the facts. 

**TL;DR:** Does anybody have data as to what specific animals consume antibiotics and for what purpose?


**EDIT:** I found a KSU study titled ""Use Estimates of In-Feed Antimicrobials in Swine Production in the United States"" which found that 1.6 million pounds of antibiotics are used in pork production annually for growth promotion/nutritional efficiency.  Add in antibiotics used for disease treatment, and the study revealed that 2.8 million pounds of antibiotics are used per year in pork production.  

However, “Hogging It,” from the Union of Concerned Scientists claimed that use for those two purposes totaled 10.3 million pounds annually.  

Further breakdown from the same UCS study: 11 million pounds of that are used in poultry feed, 
10 million pounds in hog feed and 4 million pounds in cattle feed.

**EDIT 2:** I personally don't consider the Union of Concerned Scientists a credible source.  I suspect their breakdown of ""non-therapeutic use"" is inflated.  [24.6 million pound for exclusively growth use in 2001 vs the FDA figure in 2010 indicating *total* use, growth and therapeutic, at 28.8 million.  Doesn't pass the smell test. A lot of this must be therapeutic]. I am still looking

**EDIT 3:** Official statement from the National Cattlemen: ""In the mid-1980s, the National Cattlemen’s Association adopted policy discouraging feeding low levels of antibiotics to promote growth."" Perhaps this number is so difficult to come by because antibiotics are *not* used for growth purposes in beef cattle, preferring hormone treatment instead.

**The Good Stuff:** From tjw (in a comment below): 
Here's a 1999 feedlot survey: 
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/feedlot/downloads/feedlot99/Feedlot99_dr_PartIII.pdf

Here's a 2006 swine survey: 
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/swine/downloads/swine2006/Swine2006_dr_PartIII.pdf

There's a lot of detail there, especially in the cattle one. The gist of it seems to be that hog operations seem very likely to feed antibiotics (81.2% of sites). I think that means continually. The survey does not specify which classes of antibiotics are fed but does seem to consider dewormers separate from antibiotics.
Cattle operations on the other hand are are a lot more complicated. It seems like almost all feedlots feed new arrivals with some form of tetracycline, but the average duration is less than 8 days. This is a most likely the labeled use for shipping fever. The only classes of antibiotics that tend to be fed long-term are Tylosin (a coccidiostat) and Virginiamycin (an anti-bacterial antibiotic). However, when you look at the percent of cattle in the feedlot that recieved Virginiamycin, the number is only 0.1%. 42.3% of cattle do get fed Tylosin though and the number is much higher at feedlots with &gt; 8000 head (47.2%) than it is with smaller feedlots (16.1%). This is most likely because coccidiosis is more of a problem in larger feedlots.
Long story short (too late), cattle in feedlots aren't fed very much anti-bacterial antibiotics at all.",,False,self,t5_2qrz8,1349559644.0,,,True,t3_zunrg,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/zunrg/breaking_down_the_numbers_behind_livestock/,

**Overview**- Here, main source of irrigation is canals, and monsoon season. we grow wheat, cotton, mustard, Kinnow(a breed of Orange) and Guar.
not everything is done using machines, for example cotton is collected using labor.

* being poor farmer means you have 1-10 Acres.

* being average farmer means you have 10-15 Acres.

* being above average farmer means you have 15-30 Acres.

* being rich farmer means you have 30~ Acres.

that's why most of the foreign companies modify their tractors according to our need.
Fuel price is 45 Rupees per litre[1 US $=52 Rupees]


**Machines used**

* Tractor ranging from 40-60HP. i have FORD 3600[they are still available here]. [image](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/49877176.jpg)

* other farm equipment, for example Harvester we call them combines [Image1](http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/galleryformatter_slide/Rice-field-in-india.jpg)

* WE DON'T USE BULL CARTS AND BULLS


**PROBLEMS**
here are some problems faced by Farmers in Punjab[India]

* OIL PRICES- Govt gives subsidy on diesel but recently govt is thinking to cut it so oil prices are going high.

* SOCIAL PERCEPTION- Normally farmers are seen as Idiots, ignorant, bully and illiterate. Farming here is last option for a son of farmer. when one don't get any job in any other sector then they resort to farming[not willingly but as a last option]. The main reason behind this is profit which is marginal for average farmer due to fertilizer price, fuel price and labor.

* CORRUPTION- It is a national problem for Developing India but it affects farmers mainly. bureaucratic corruption prevails in schemes made by govt for farmers. for eg- Govt gives subsidy on fertilizers. Fertilizers are made by govt owned companies run by bureaucrats, but bureaucrat misuse this subsidy by manipulating the output from plants. they show they have produced 1000 units[just for example] but in-actual they produce only half of it hence gulping subsidy for 500 units. similarly, schemes never reach to farmers.

* CROP PRICES- here, govt decides minimum crop prices per quintal(1 quintal=100 kg). crop prices are low here farmers struggle to save some money after working so hard in fields.
See- [farmer's suicide in India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers'_suicides_in_India)

I would LOVE to include a section in my program that is all about the benefits of local (and sustainable) farming vs industrial.  Some of the parts I would like to examine within that are 
- carbon footprint of shipping
- freshness of food (due to shipping)
- extra chemicals needed
- genetic diversity
- profit margins for farmers within each group.

I would also love to have more elements, keeping in mind this is for 5th graders.   The main thing I am having trouble finding is hard statistics.  The IDEAS are supported, but I have not been able to find (for example) an orange shipped to CA from Florida costs x with y carbon footprint as oppose to one grown within the county.

Much appreciated to hear any comments or suggestions.

so i've got tractors, even a little old farmall, i've got a plow, disc, a big old tiller, a borrowed spreader, and am working on my supply list to order a drip irrigation setup. 

what i dont know is what to look for, what to be worrying about, what to be working on right now (soil prep, obviously, and i am, but that doesn't take enough time to stop my worrying). the plant date is may 1 in our zone - not taking any risks with late freezes.

Our goal is to be doing that as full time as possible by the time I am 32.

I currently have an undergrad degree in Computer Science and am A+ and Network+ certified. I am presently teaching overseas. She has yet to finish her undergrad. I plan to work full time while she goes to school, until I can transition to farming.

This is where I need your help. We have decided that upon our return to Missouri (where we plan to reside) I will begin taking Ag classes at the local community college (as my alma mater doesn't have an Ag program.) This sounds like a fantastic idea but...

Like with Comp Sci, I put a lot into it and got very little out in terms of personal fulfillment and joy. I know I want to farm and my wife more than supports me in this.

Early this morning, the calving barn on my family's farm burned to the ground, taking nearly 100 calves with it.  My cousin arrived at the scene in time to attempt to remove about a dozen cows, but no more.  The screaming was unbearable.  The smell of burnt flesh is still hanging in the air.  After visiting this morning to console my cousin, I went to work, and when I explained my distress to coworkers, friends, even my husband, the biggest reaction I got was ""Oh man... That sucks.""  No one seems to understand that these animals weren't just a paycheck, they were creatures we bottle-fed by hand every day.  My family is fucking GRIEVING right now.

TL;DR: Family farm's calving barn burned down, taking almost 100 calves with it.  People don't get the feels involved.  Thanks for listening.

The family sold the cows in 1996 and so I have few memories with milking, however today I remembered one of my favorite things to do as a young farm kid came around harvest time. Until approx 2001 my family still used a corn picker for some of the corn harvest. As young kids my brother, cousin and I would crawl up into the full gravity wagons and push the corn down and out of the wagon if it needed to be done. It was always a blast sliding down the steep sides and laughing at how we struggled to climb up the slippery sides when we had to get out. Also, when our dads were shoveling the corn into the truck after it had dried in the corn crib, we would slide down the corn pile and push fresh cobs their way.

My wife and I, mid-thirties with impeccable credit, are interested in starting a new farm from scratch. We aren't interested in picking a commodity crop that does well in our area (Western Montana) and growing as much of it as we can, we'd prefer to dabble in a diversity of products - small goat dairy with value-adds, rabbitry, eggs, maybe some aquaculture, taking the time to grow a modest 500 or so tree orchard, berries, herbs, annual veggies, etc etc etc. A one-stop shop.

The thing with this, is that it takes *time* to build all this. Some of these products wont yield a materially harvestable amount for several years, such as the orchard.

In the event that we were able to secure financing for 100+ acres plus some equipment, how does financing work when you wont be grossing much in the way of revenue for a while? 

Is starting a new farm even a thing any more? Or do you kinda have to get in on an operation that is already established in the marketplace? 

tldr: Is there a way to finance a new farm that allows the farm to mature? 

edit: Really interesting dialogue going here. Thanks so much for all the replies. Upvotes all around. More about us, we currently own a house on 2 acres and have a handful of milk goats, rabbits, chickens. Yes our credit is 800+ each. I've got 15 years cross-industry business and financial management experience. She's got 7 + years of self-employment and has owned livestock of one kind or another all her life. We've explored Grade A dairy certification for where we're at, but don't see us growing beyond 8 milk goats here and infrastructure costs are too high to justify for that few. I love love love the idea of starting small and growing into it but if at least one of us is tied to a full-time in-city jobbie-job, we aren't going to be able to get enough land with our everyday cashflow (I'm talking even just 10 acres) where a commute is realistic. So how does one start small? If we could make a real run of it with the 2 acres we have, that'd be great, but I don't think that will cut it. Would love to hear that I am wrong though.

I already know all about the diet of beef cattle, but most folks don't.  I can talk all I want to about my knowledge, but most people want sources.  Help me find sources.

Myself and every rancher that I know, use native grassland as the base of feed for the herd.  I've been told by a UNL professor that grass constitutes 80% of the food intake of the whole heard (steer, bulls, heifers, and cows averaged out).  Corn constitutes only around 12% of the average cows diet.

Most people have been taught that the diet of a beef cow is 100% corn.  I need sources that show what this is not true.

**Update:** if you look at /u/camdemonium's 'cattle on feed' report, there are 11.2 million cattle on feed as of 1/1/2013. [Report here.](http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/nass/CattOnFe//2010s/2013/CattOnFe-01-25-2013.pdf)

Now if you look at the total US beef herd numbers we are at 29.3 million as of 1/1/2013.  [Report here.](http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/current/Catt/Catt-02-01-2013.pdf)

This means that 18.1 million beef cows are presumably on pasture, 61%.

I think this pretty well proves that at any given time, most cattle are on pasture.  However, this still doesn't address the fact that corn represents a small portion of their overall diet.  I have no idea how we can quantify how much forage (grass) is consumed.  Perhaps we can back into it if we know daily averages and the amount of corn that is fed to cattle during 2012 or 2011.

**UPDATE 2:** I have also stumbled upon this Colorado State article discussing the fact that ""Most of the beef raised in the United States, and even more so globally, consume relatively small amounts of grain.""

**Boxcarr Farms is just the begining of our dreams. We are a family of chefs, artists, and artisans. We are passionate about our land, animals, community, and the environmnent's future. Our family owned farm is nestled in the heart of Cedar Grove, North Carolina. We purchased this beautiful 30 acres in October 2009 with a thirst for many wonderful ventures. On April 4, 2013 our main house caught fire. Unable to leave the land and the animals, our family is camping in a trailor with no facilites, depending on genorators to pump well water for the animals and crops. Any amount that you are able to donate would be greatly appreciated. It will go towards rebuilding our home and securing the future of our farm.

I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on the issues on patenting organisms. My main question I pose to you is: **why is patenting an organism bad, or why is it good?**

If you feel patenting an organism developed by a company is bad, then can you explain why you feel this way - preferably using evidence?

If you feel patenting an organism developed by said company is good, then can you explain why you feel this is beneficial to everyone (and not just the company)? Again, preferably citing evidence.

**Note:** This is NOT a discussion regarding the safety of genetically modified food, the effect on the environment or labeling. This is solely about companies receiving patents for organisms they have engineered. Please keep this an open-discussion, and don't be afraid to post your opinions even if it goes against the mainstream. Keep downvotes only on trolls or rude people, please!

Thanks for your input. I'm genuinely curious to hear peoples opinions and I will avoid getting involved in the discussion as some of you already know my opinion on the matter.

Yesterday, I told her I wanted to get some frozen yogurt, and she said something like, ""You're not really going eat frozen yogurt.""  I thought she was joking, but when we got to the freezer section, she started berating me about my frozen confection being more important to me than stopping cows from being tortured.  Apparently, she's under the impression that people at dairy farms just go around breaking cow's tails for no reason.  Someone at her work had shown her a video of farm animals being abused.

I told her that it sounded to me like an isolated incident that was being used as part of some propaganda campaign, but she insisted that it wasn't.  I made the argument that you could find many instances of pets being abused by owners, but that that doesn't mean people should stop having pets.  She wasn't having it.  When, we got back into the car she started crying over the well-being of the cows.  She's 25.  I did not get to enjoy my frozen yogurt. 

Can anyone who has first hand experience with dairy farming evaluate, from an unbiased stand-point, the quality of life of the average dairy cow?  Even if they aren't being abused, do things like a mother's calf being taken away from her have a serious impact on the cow's ""happiness?""

My dad farms around 500 tillable acres with corn,soybeans, wheat, and red clover along with raising cattle on the land too steep to till. I have some questions that I have asked dad but he says I too young to understand and that I hope reddit could help with. I joined a fraternity here on campus made up of a lot of farm kids like myself but my family's farm is considerably smaller than their 2k-6k acre farms. Something I always hear theme talk about is how they have to spend money at the end of each year so they wont be taxed as heavily, is this a real thing? This was how they justified buying new diesel trucks, combines and equipment each year but my dad uses what he has and very rarely buys new machinery. Our biggest tractor is a john deere 4430, and our combine is a 6620 john deere. Another thing that im curious about is plowing. My dad plows everything that he keeps cows on over the winter, along with cultivating corn and beans in the summer and when I ask the guys about this they say that plowing is for lack of a better work archaic and that my family is farming in the past? Do you still plow? Another one I have is that my family plants soybeans with a modified corn planter, are we the only ones to do this? All of the big farmers around home/ the ones I know at school plant with drills. Another thing I have a question about right now is buying land. There have been at least two cases where my dad has farmed on halves with older guys for 15-20 years and then shaken their hand to buy the land planning on going to the bank the next day only to have one of the super farmers in our area buy the land out from underneath him. Do big farmers try to keep smaller farmers from buying land where you live as well?

Any pointers or advice? ,X_Trisarahtops_X,15,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/r6vtq/interview_on_a_farm_my_dream_job_very_nervous_any/,"Hi Reddit. 21f here. I have an interview for an animal care assistant job on a farm (http://www.springbarnfarm.com/ for anyone who wants more information on the type of farm it is). 
I'm very nervous. The job description asked for 2 years minimum in the industry. I wrote that I dont have this, but I do have an animal degree with X Y and Z experiences and did voluntary work on a small city farm every week for X amount of months and have done work experience in various places. They wanted to interview me anyway. 
On the phone, I was told its just a chat and informal interview and to think of things that might sell myself to them. I'm nervous as my lack of 'proper' experience means anything I know how to do, other interviewees will probably know how to do (since the description originally said 2 years in the industry). However, this is more or less what I want to do for a career. It'll sting if I mess it up and dont give it my best. Noone around me is in this field really, so advice is sparse on the ground.

Can anyone give me any general pointers or techniques?  What sort of traits would such an establishment be looking for? Any advice? What would make you hire someone for such a role? 

Thanks Reddit!

I've been looking online for a guide explaining the legality of building on a farm. For example, if I buy a 10 acre agricultural land:

1) Would I be allowed to build a small house for a small family on it? 

2) Would I be allowed to build a small lake/pond (one acre or less) which contains fish for personal consumption? Would it have to be some distance away from the agricultural plot of land?

3) Is it possible to buy 10 acres of completely undeveloped land and use only 2 acres of it for farming, and leave the rest as natural forest?

4) Does a greenhouse attached to the house count as a part of the house, or the agricultural operation?

5) Does agricultural land have to make revenue? what if I only harvested for my personal use only?

If anyone is able to answer any of those questions it would be great, as I have exhausted my google abilities.

(yet) We have secured steady employment that is not location dependent, and now that we are no longer tied to the city we are seriously considering moving out to the country and starting a small farm somewhere in western Oregon. Something around 20-40 acres. Financing the purchase would not be a problem.

Neither of us has much experience actually working on a farm, but while I grew up in the city, both of my parents are from farm families and I do like to think I have a pretty good idea of what farming life is like.

We don't expect to get rich, or even make much money farming. What we'll probably start with is renting or sharing out most of the land for the first few years while we get started. What we would like to establish first is some basic homesteading stuff to feed ourselves; some chickens, a vegetable garden, a couple goats, maybe some rabbits. Eventually a few hop vines and maybe a small plot of barley for some homegrown homebrew. Ultimately I would like to start establishing some beehives, and when I get the hang of that and the honey starts flowing use it to make and sell mead. 

The rest of the acreage would probably be used mostly to grow hay and lavender, bees love the stuff and it makes great honey. I would rent most of the acreage out for hay until I felt comfortable doing it on my own.

My dad started teaching me how to brew when I was thirteen, and it is one thing I know I can do well. I happen to have a particular fondness for mead, a knack for making it well, and while the craft beer market in Oregon is pretty saturated there is a pretty big hole where mead should be. 

Like I said, I don't expect to make a bajillion bucks. We just want to get out of the city, own something real, produce something of value, give our future kids a great place to grow up and hopefully not lose our shirts in the process.

1369775780.0,12,self.farming,1f83fb,The folly of organic and GMO food labeling and a suggestion for something better. x-post from /r/organic,Mach10X,18,6,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1f83fb/the_folly_of_organic_and_gmo_food_labeling_and_a/,"I wrote this up a while ago and wanted your opinions.  I know many of you may be in the crowd of 100% organic and 100% non-GMO or nothing.  However hear me out and help he understand if I've made any mistakes in my logic and research.

I wanted to speak a little about the labeling of organic foods and the proposed regulations to label GMO crops. I think this is a very dangerous game and I'll explain. In a nutshell both GMO and organic can be both good and bad. The true holy grail relies in using the best parts of both organic farming and non-organic farming practices, and using GMO responsibly.  In fact many fruits and vegetables create large amounts of natural pesticides that GMO could remove to make the foods less toxic to humans while substituting a more potent and less toxic alternative repellent or pesticide via GMO or by manual application.

Regarding organic, organic does not mean more nutritional, organic farmers can label foods organic as long as they use naturally occurring pesticides (many of which are very harmful and damaging to the environment).  By enticing farmers to go fully organic they are cutting out many of the best parts of non-organic farming, namely the good synthetic pesticides that are highly targeted and designed to breakdown into harmless substances.  Many synthetic pesticides and repellents in their unbroken down form are harmless even in concentrations hundreds or thousands of times what you could possibly get from eating treated foods that have been unwashed (same is true of the best organic pesticides as well).  Farmers should be enticed to use the last harmful pesticides not just whatever will get them the organic sticker.

Current laws and regulations on organic food labeling are not helping us at all, they are causing farmers to jump through many hoops that shouldn't be there. For example, organic beef cannot be fed antibiotics of any kind ever. The horrible suffering of the animals that do become sick is perverse. There should be regulations on responsible use of antibiotics. Lazy farmers put it in the feed. Responsible farmers quarantine sick cattle and administer only to those that need it most. Sure it costs more but it's the responsible thing to do.

Regarding GMO labeling. We should not be enticing farmers to completely cut out GMO, they should, however take a stand against harmful GMO and terrible GMO practices. For example, Roundup ready GMO can be great as long as the farmers are using round up sparingly and the modification has been proven to not alter the nutrition of the plant or cause the plant to produce any harmful byproducts in the transcription of these modified genes.  Responsible farmers would use roundup ready seed as well as other methods of weed control (great examples in organic non chemical weed control methods). A combination of both is ideal. Irresponsible farmers looking at nothing but profits will use far too much round up and end up fueling the evolution of herbicide resistant plants while flooding the environment with excess toxic chemicals via runoff.  GMOs that reduce the time for germination and increase growth rate, as long is it's carefully tested and openly peer reviewed to show that no harmful proteins are expressed by the gene insertion process are a not just good but necessary to feed our growing populations.

The solution? We need some sort of non-profit or neutral agency that can certify responsible farming practices and techniques. I'd like to know that the food I'm buying was farmed only with chemicals and fertilizers that pass the Ames test ([info on this and how it pertains to farming](http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/synthetic-v-natural-pesticides/)).  I'd love to buy meat, produce, and grains that used responsible environmentally friendly methods that are a combination of the best practices and methods that organic, non-organic, GMO and non-GMO have to offer.  This voluntary participation group would ban certain harmful practices and provide an approved list of safe to use chemicals that have been scientifically proven to be effective and the least toxic.  Farmers would be audited for amounts of chemicals use in a fair manner and agree to apply non-chemical techniques and pest control solutions in tandem with responsible use of chemical pesticides and repellents.

Food demand is going to increase.  This is going to increase the consumption of non-renewable energy that modern agriculture depends on, which will increase food prices.   It will also increase the unsustainable land and ecosystem degradation caused by traditional methods of agriculture.  Eventually, this will cause a slow and persistent decline in output.

There is a great alternative to the course we are on.  We can use our resources to transition to sustainable systems of food production.

**What agricultural practices should we work to reduce and cease?:**

- The use of non-renewable energy.

- The use of chemicals that have negative [human](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_pesticides) and [environmental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_pesticides) effects.

- [Slash and burn techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_and_burn) - used by between 200 and 500 million people worldwide.  

**What practices should we adopt and develop?:**

- Water Conservation

- No-Till

- Recycling of local nutrients through composting, mulching, and/or animal husbandry 

**Resources:**

[National Sustainable Farming Information Service](http://attra.ncat.org/)

[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education](http://www.sare.org/)

**Things to think about:**

How do we convince farmers to transition to sustainable practices?  You would have to show it to be profitable and simplified through technology or community support.

How do we inspire more people to become farmers and simplify getting into the field?  Design small scale systems of production that people can experiment with.  

What affordable technologies could we create to simplify things for rural farmers?  How could we educate them on sustainable practices?

A man’s usefulness in a herd ceases at once
when he loses his temper and bestows rough usage.
Men must be patient. Cattle are not reasoning beings.
Remember that this is the Home of Mothers.
Treat each cow as a Mother should be treated.
The giving of milk is a function of Motherhood;
rough treatment lessens the flow.

",farmingquestion,12,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/13dz98/my_friend_thinks_he_has_a_multimillion_dollar/,"Hey reddit, I got a friend who a couple of months ago learned in math class that hexagons are the most efficient way to fill up any space. He then thought that industrial agriculture would be 20% more efficient if a similar rule was applied to corn farming when crops were laid out. (For reference, he is talking about this sort of pattern: http://poj.org/images/3766_2.gif). So I ask you reddit, would this hexagon pattern for corn really change the industry forever? 

EDIT: After talking to my friend this morning, I have asked him to clarify and he has come through. The basic concept on that picture I linked would be that corn is planted on every point of the hexagon shape so that rows would be formed. So, instead of straight parallel lines filled with corn they would be staggered so that the corn rows would take on the hexagon shape. I think he was a bit surprised with the first commenters picture that details that exactly (For reference: http://www.nzdl.org/gsdl/collect/cdl/archives/HASH0172/7bf7ecc3.dir/p017c.gif) but nonetheless he still thinks it might not have been applied on an industrial scale or to corn farming...help this guy out reddit :)

Our 'stick pile' is the size of our house, and we have at least 4 places on the property storing cut and treated wood, most of the piles being larger than the space that's available to store them.  Some of it of dubious quality.

What can I do with this 'resource?'  It's clear I have too much of the stuff, and the way I'm storing it is not working.  Should I invest in better (any?  I have a home-depot kind of chipper that is not really up to this task...) chipping equipment?  Is there some way I can break it down faster?  Is there some zen to wood storage you can impart to me?  Any other use of wood that I should know about?

We recycle what we can, but produce more wood scraps than we recycle.  We have two wood stoves, but very mild winters.  I'm in a drylands: The Middle Rio Grande River Valley.

Our grain prices have been rising steadily over the last several years - they're about 15-20% higher now compared to two years ago.

We're farming on 100 acres, of which only about 15 or so are used for grazing our livestock.  We have a good supply of manure, both chicken and ruminant, and I've been pondering the viability of putting 10 or so acres into barley or wheat.

* What sort of yield can one generally expect in my climate?  Our flat bottom fields are all rich peat.
* Related to the last question, if I'm shooting for about 20 or so tonnes per year, how many acres would I need in production?
* What sort of equipment (preferably small and inexpensive) would be best for farming at this scale?
* Are there good varieties that'd do well in our wetter climate out here?  (We're in BC, but the climate would be similar to Washington state or Oregon.)
* Do you think this a bad idea?  I'm entirely open to this being a bad idea. :)
* In my online research, I've come across an timey turnip/wheat/barley/clover rotation.  I'm aware it's more work, but the ability to close the loop on the bulk of our farm inputs is appealing.  Does anyone have any experience or advice on this sort of rotation?

Is small, local agriculture (including urban farms, home gardens etc.) a viable method of farming and providing food for the future compared with large conventional farms? How can we successfully integrate growing food and learning about where our food comes from into education from a young age?

Essentially, why is one of these methods of farming or approaches to farming^ a more viable way of providing food for the future while keeping our earth healthy in the long run. I know that I've drawn a line and divided farming into two black and white sides where as its much more gray and varied then that, but I was just trying to simplify for the question.

It is pretty straight forward - acquire chickens/goose, make shelter, they reproduce. What was bad about chicken is they sabotage roots of the trees, which is quite a problem when besides living in the forest, you have hundreds of apple trees around.

So we got two turkeys for, made them a temporary shelter. The eggs appeared on second week when they felt really well in new environment. The mother made life to five new turkey babies.

What surprised me about them is that the kids slept under the male turkey and female turkey walked them outside, while goose do it otherwise. 

The life of two small turkeys was ended by a hawk and a cat. cat went to maritime school shortly after, as it was old and that was already fifth incident. Hawk left unpunished.

I could not understand who might have done it. No cat can get there during the night time, and cat would have ate them, not left and stomped into the corner. Hawk is innocent this time. Boars can't get in. Dogs either. For now only suspect is female turkey.

My next plan is to make better portable shelter for them for the next year and see what happens. 

How do you think what and who might have done it? Any other tips? Was the female turkey jealous?

Our farm started as a dairy farm.  I had no desire to milk cows every day for the rest of my life, so after college I worked in TV for a couple of years.  My TV station when bankrupt about the same time my parents sold the dairy herd.  

So I came back to the farm on a temporary basis and am still there 11 years later.  We crop farm, make hay and straw (lots of landscapers and contractors) and run a corn maze and pumpkin patch in the fall.  We're fairly close to Washington DC in a town that is becoming a foodie destination so vegetables (for restaurants or roadside stand) seems like a good option.  

The problem is, when vegetables need the most attention, is when I'm super busy with hay and straw.  By the time I'm caught up on those jobs my test plots have become a jungle of redroot, lambs quarter and Johnson Grass.

The basic premiss is to show where math is used in real life, in this case, farming, i.e., growing food. 

Here are the next three videos:

* [Food and Farming, Part 4: The Spreadsheet, a To Do List, Yield for Broccoli (Math in Real Life)](http://youtu.be/rU8LO0iXom4)

* [Food and Farming, Part 5: The Spreadsheet, a Flowchart, The Big Picture (Math in Real Life)](http://youtu.be/uxoLLHW0t3U)

* [Food and Farming, Part 6: Example #1: Calculating Crop Yield (Math in Real Life)](http://youtu.be/La_JqIxpa94)

Three more videos and a course description for this series still to come. 

As always, feedback is greatly appreciated. 

Peace.

The latter part of the article references [this earlier CDC study](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/pdfs/11-1370.pdf) that estimated disease outbreak rates for raw milk were ""150 times higher than for pasteurized milk"".

I should note that I don't have a problem with raw milk consumption or sales.  My family drinks raw milk from our dairy.  This issue comes up a lot because permitted raw milk sales are legal in PA, but not allowed in Maryland.

I've always been interested in farming, animals and nature. It would make me really happy to have a few crops, some milk and meat animals, eggs and honeybees. I'd like some hands on experience. My idea was to intern on a farm for the summer before I go back to college. I have no prior experience (other than with horses and some gardening), but I'd love to spend four months learning how a farm runs and getting down to work. Plus, I'd love living on a farm, and I need some extra cash to pay for school.

Any advice?

I'm also not sure if this is the appropriate reddit for this question if it's not let me know. 

The information I am looking for is more out of curiosity then anything. Basically I want to know what would be the benefits of raising pigs for meat rather than cows. (optimally I'd like data on all farm animals).

For instance: I want stats like it takes x pounds of feed to get y pounds of meat off of a pig, off a cow, off a chicken, etc. 

Also included (I assume many of you have personal experience) do animals differ greatly in other costs? Such as vaccinations, housing(?), breeding. This information though isn't necessary for a simple model I'd talk about with my friends, but more data is never bad. 

Before I get into this my own assumptions (I don't know very much about farming and livestock raising) are that Rabbits would provide the most meat per cost, while Steers would provide the least meat per cost. 

Also if no one wants to do the tedious work (I don't blame you, lol) could you at least point me in the proper direction to where I could find the data I'm looking for. I'd even take anecdotal data like ""At my farm I spend x amount on feed for y chickens and then you can get about z pounds of chicken meat from one chicken.

I got on this topic because in another thread farm subsidies came up, and I was wondering on a purely monetary level which animals give the most bang for the buck as it were.",,False,self,t5_2qrz8,False,,,True,t3_inol0,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/inol0/what_animals_produce_the_most_meat_for_the/,

Is the dichotomy simply about quality versus quantity? In what sense is one more admirable of a pursuit, since having lots of food and having good food are both desirable.

My original thought was to try Einkorn. On that front, my problem is that it doesn't seem to be available in the US in any substantial bulk quantities(like a 25 lb bag). I could obviously start with a smaller amount, but it would be years before I could have enough left over for food purposes. Plan B would be to try Emmer wheat, but I'm wondering what would happen if I did both eventually, either in different plots, or rotating. My understanding is that most wheat will hybridize promiscuously if given the chance. The plot I'm considering is rural, but quite far from any cultivated fields, so cross-pollination should be minimal.
  
Would it be possible to have both varieties nearby and remain distinct?

My wife and I are in the early research phase of a business plan involving operation of a medium-sized greenhouse farm for non-commodity crop production. She grew up in a rural area where her family worked a couple thousand acres of wheat fields implementing traditional soil farming methods, and isn't keen on repeating the experience. I've worked in tech all my life so our interests within the scope of this project mesh nicely: My very loose concept thus far is to integrate large passive solar greenhouses with Arduino-controlled hydroponics using environmental sensors and have the lot mostly run itself. We also want to raise various livestock that provide multiple product opportunities (poultry, beef, goats, sheep, etc.). We basically want to take the traditional self-sufficiency model, add some tech to provide automation and enable us to grow whatever we want (Colorado climate = limited outdoor selection), scale up production, and monetize the results.

Just mentioning all of that in case anyone has feedback. I haven't really bounced these ideas off of anyone with practical experience, so please fire away if you feel inclined. I'm sure there are a billion things I haven't thought about yet.

Now, the flurry of questions I have is mostly to do with the business end of things: How did you decide what crops to grow? Market research? What do you do with your products after production, e.g. what are your revenue streams? I'm familiar with wholesale, CSA, and some direct sales methods, but how do you get your foot in the door with any of them? If selling to a restaurant, do you bring in a selection of fresh product and offer a business card? If selling to a school? Do you operate a roadside stand anywhere? Pick-your-own fields? What am I not asking that I should be? Where can I go to get this information?

Figuring out how to manifest the product is not a problem for us, but figuring out which products and what to do with them afterward is presenting a challenge. We'll be going to some Farmer's Markets around town over the next few weeks to talk to some vendors and ask similar questions but I figured I'd start here.

Proud of myself.,big_onion,8,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/13l0a4/first_big_sales_for_thanksgiving_proud_of_myself/,"We bought a small farm earlier this year and have been really working our butts off (we both have day jobs). All year we've been selling loads of eggs, and loads of meat (mostly for pet food -- weird niche market we stumbled into but hey, whatever works!). We raised a small group of turkeys to sell for Thanksgiving and here's the shot of most of them all processed, packaged, and in the fridge, ready for pickup or delivery (which happened this morning). (Also some chickens in there!) I kept a 22 lb turkey (bottom left in the pic) for myself, and can't wait to cook it! We hand pluck, so it's definitely a labor of love.

I know a lot of you are probably from bigger farms, but I wanted to give an internet high five to any other small farmers who have to wear the many hats you need to do it all yourself. It's no easy job, and it's nice to see the customers happy and really appreciative of the effort. (I admit, I also like making a little money off of it!)

Market research? I have no clue.

Marketing? I plan to start at farmers markets in the area.

* If this is feasable, is there a kind of goat that would be best suited for this job?

* Have other people tried this?

In fact, a lot of farmers don't realize what the dollars are used for or how they are distributed.  

A little info:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_checkoff_program

I am in favor of the program due to the research paid for by the program for corn.  Ethanol became much more affordable due to the research funded with checkoff dollars.  The political lobbying that got ethanol quotas was also funded by Checkoff.

With the success, I'm surprised that other industries haven't tried it.  Unions are similar but not really.  Imagine if all computer sales had to put 1% into the IEEE to fund research for future development.

Or 1% of healthcare costs when to a fund to educate consumers.

So much of what farming does is self-funded and self-guided instead of  a government fund.  I just wish I could explain that to more people and others would adopt the process.

FAMACHA of 4, no sores around her mouth or inside on the front, pooping just fine, eating pasture, still occasionally nursing from momma.

But she's always laying down. Not always, but most of the time -- more than our other lambs. We occasionally give our flock some sweet feed (we normally pasture) as  a treat and the flock usually comes running, but she rarely comes for any, always staying back. Her momma comes running for it (she would do this even when she was little, often leaving the little lamb waaaay in the back calling for her).

Any ideas? Should we not worry? It's been warm lately, but even on the cool days after a rain she's out doing the same thing. Sometimes on her own, sometimes with her momma.

This is generally monitored by the seed companies, who then report it to someone up the chain, who reports it to the EPA. If I fail to comply (multiple times), I can lose my right to purchase modern seed, and possibly face legal action.

Last year, I bought seed from 3 different dealers. I purchased more than enough refuge seed to cover my legal requirements, but I didn't purchase it all from the same company. So when one seed company looked at their books, I didn't appear to have purchased enough refuge seed, which they then dutifully reported. Shortly thereafter I got a nastygram in the mail.

I went to that company with the recipts and other documentation showing that I had, in fact, purchased the seed I was supposed to. They apologized and assured me that they'd talk with the reporting agency and get it cleared up. Gave it a week, called back, no progress. I talked to the regional sales manager, and he assured me of the same. Called back later and he again assured me it was taken care of. Never heard another word.

Last week I got another nastygram informing me that it hadn't been cleared up, and that the time for appeal had now expired. Well shit. I've repeatedly tried going through the dealer in question (who probably won't be getting my business again) without success. Now I'm trying to get in contact with the agency that manages compliance to see if I can deal with it directly. Except that I haven't been able to find which agency it is.

We started with about 40 calves live birth. They are getting well over 200lbs now and we have been experiencing at least one or two a week suddenly dying over night.

Normally I go out there and tackle down sickly calves, treating them for any BRD, Fevers, Bloated Stomachs, but I'm a bit baffled by the number of sudden deaths from seemingly otherwise healthy individuals.

Doing the research, the main likely possibility would be Clostridial Diseases which would explain quick deaths for strong individuals. This would require a 7-8 way vaccine. It's been unexpected since we mostly only have to worry about BRD in our climate.

One issue could be the water supply, the main supply is too high for young calves to access so there is a trough on the ground now which easily gets contaminated. It's been mostly covered up now to keep it cleaner so calves can't walk into it.

Another issue is possibly heat. We have a small herd in the barn (large barn but only 1/2 is occupied) with zero losses; it can be opened up to accommodate more for free access, but my aging father is stubborn and obstructive to this; using a friend who raises calves from 500lbs up in open fields as an excuse.

I could use some advice. Regardless next year I'll have to take the initiative and make some changes to protect our future livestock.",,False,self,t5_2qrz8,1373838000.0,,,True,t3_1iaq9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1iaq9e/issue_with_calves_suddenly_dying/,

Hey r/farming, so I have an interesting situation... I have recently acquired a nice piece of land in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. It has good soils (conser silt loam, santiam silt loam, and waldo silt loam class 2&amp;3) It is slightly sloped to the SE has easy access and is near Monroe, OR. There is about 70 acres that is currently cultivated (Ryegrass) but I am looking for a but more of a return on it than what the current Lessee is paying (just over 2k/yr)

I am considering planting a hardwood timber crop across it for a long term investment (since I can't actively manage it every day) but this will leave open ground for years before the trees close canopy leaving ample time for other uses as well. I'm thinking something like maple, cherry, walnut, chestnut, etc.

Any thoughts on what I can do with a limited amount of time each year?   30-40 days a year onsite is probably the max.  How about any info on the actual lease price for that land at just over 2k/year for like 70 acres of land with good soils? It seems kinda low to me but maybe I'm wrong?
How about any other ideas?

The mother-in-law then arrives home and proceeds to shout at my wife that because the sheep have been out grazing all day (they have), she shouldn't be laying the sheep on their sides to cut their nails as their intestines will jam/blow up/explode causing the sheep's death.

i'm starting to work in the fields and would like some advices about softwares related to farming.
In fact one related to irrigation: as it is the rain season i'm using rain gauge to measures the rainfall and then cut the irrigation  on a gross estimation.
Is there a good software where you can put statistics about irrigation like rain / temperatures / evapotranspiration ?

A other one on crops management (sugarcane) where you can put how much water/ fertilizer you have used and results of the harverst etc....to have a clear view

The product is price insurance on crops/livestock. Essentially, you would pay a nominal premium (say, $20/tonne) in order to lock into a bottom price (say, $600/tonne), and if the market price dips below that, you can collect the difference. 

For example:
Current price is $607/tonne for canola, and you'd like to lock your bottom line at $600/tonne. This is to protect yourself from the swings of the futures market, namely the dips that significantly affect your bottom line.

* Current price (in Apr.): $607/tonne

* Premium: ~$20/tonne

* Base: $600/tonne

* Tonnes protected: 1000. 

* Total upfront cost: $20,000

* Market price in Nov: $500/tonne

* Payout ($600 insured - $500 market)*1000 tonnes: $100,000

Would this be a product you would be interested in?

EDIT: This is differentiated from a futures sale (deferred delivery) because you are not capping your price. With the futures sale, you are guaranteeing another individual the sale price (i.e. if the future is at $600/tonne, you must sell at $600/tonne, no more, no less), whereas in this, you are guaranteeing only the bottom line, however at a premium. Should the market price (for whatever reason) go up to $1000/tonne, you would have to sell at $600 in a futures contract, but through us, you would be selling at market regardless (at $1000/tonne).

What has the highest profit yields? 

I have worked with chickens and pigs before. Are these good animals to have on a farm operation? 

Eggs vs meat chickens?

Greenhouse?

Fish? 

Who do I sell to?
