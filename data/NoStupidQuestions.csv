I want to know what the main aspects are, what about it makes people have a good time and what a typical person's goals are in going out.

As I understand it, first people meet for pre-drinking because it's cheaper than getting drunk in the club. It's a good time to have a laugh as well.

After some time of pre-drinking, people decide to head to the club, I'm guessing when they think it will be late enough to be full.

At the club people queue outside and have a chat while waiting. Upon being granted entry I think people tend to head to the bar for a drink.

After this I'm not sure what's supposed to happen. Some people dance, which is fun in itself, but it feels wrong to go there simply to dance as a man. Some people mostly stand around instead of dancing, I'm curious what they get out of the experience, it's too loud to talk properly.

After a few hours I generally feel uncomfortable that I've been repeating the same few actions over and over and decide to leave.

Is the shared experience of music the main aspect? I hear a lot of people saying it's bad.

Are most guys trying to pull girls? In that case, what's the procedure for that? Words aren't easily exchanged in that environment. Is it acceptable, even expected, to go up to strangers and start interacting with them?

Man real life is hard. I could totally master it if it were a computer game.

Me, on the other hand, have been very exposed to the western culture through the internet. Presently, I run a popular website and generate ad revenue (NOT adsense). So 100% of the revenue comes from foreign land. But I still operate from a small city in India. 

Is is possible for me to move to a different country and live/work there? If so, how do I go about doing that? I've heard that getting a US business visa is very difficult after 9/11, but how are the European countries? Are there any visa-friend countries as my options?

Sorry if it's a little... Fresh... For this subreddit but I really want/need it answered, it's driving me insane

Right, so here's the deal: I'm 17 and I've been with my girl for 10 months now and the relationship is going great! Before her, I was pretty inexperienced but picked up what I had to do with foreplay and stuff very quickly and would now consider myself... Well, pretty good... The only problems were that I wasn't able to cum (from a handie or blowjob) unless it was me doing the jerking, so to speak. Also; whenever we attempted sex, I would try to put the condom on but my dick had gone down while trying to put it on. I thought it was just beginners nerves or whatever, but 10 months on I still have the same problems!
I partly attribute it to the condom being fiddly as fuck to get on, and a real ""moment ruiner"" as you have to break away from the action to put it on, but that can't be it entirely or else everyone would have that problem and no one would be having safe sex! I also figured it might be due to the fact that I do masturbate A LOT (I'm talking 2-3 times in a day) so I've decided that while my girlfriend is away for 2 weeks, I will attempt to not masturbate. Now, this will probably prove challenging so I'd like to know if anyone has any real confirmation that it will make a difference. If this is the only factor in both problems then I'm happy to stop, but I need to know because I've attempted it a couple of times before and found it quite difficult.
I hope someone can tell me the answer to my problems, and ease my mind or if there actually is something wrong with me I can go to a doctor and get it sorted out. Thank you for help. :)

My entire family is vegetarian, we do not eat seafood or chicken or any other meats, but we do eat eggs and dairy products. My two siblings and I are not Hindu ourselves, but we have all been raised vegetarian by our father. My parents have always told me that I can eat meat if I like, but I just never have wanted to.

Nobody has ever directly insulted me before in person because I am a vegetarian, but I noticed on the internet that there are many people who openly hate on vegetarians (creating insulting memes, posting mean comments, etc.). This realization that so many people harbor hatred towards vegetarians made me worried that people who I told I was vegetarian were secretly judging me because of that.

Does anyone here understand the reason why so many people seem to hate vegetarians? I know this will be a very tense topic of discussion, but any tactful and understanding responses would really be appreciated.

There's this thing that used to happen to me all the time: Get nervous for no reasons, start sweating a bit. Instead of the sweat doing what it's supposed to and cooling me down, it makes me more hot and nervous. Eventually I just start feeling really hot and uncomfortable and I can feel my heart rate get really high. It just keeps escalating and getting worse.
Slowly I figured out how to get control of it, and it doesn't happen as often, and when it does, it's not as bad as it used to be.
I was wondering if there's a name for this in psychology/medicine because I've never heard anyone else mention it but at the same time I find it really hard to believe that I'm the only one that it (used to) happen to.

John's friend Shirley, wanting to play a practical joke, sneaks into his house and, without waking him up, lights a cigarette and puts it in John's mouth.

In his sleep, John smokes the whole cigarette and then Shirley gets rid of the cigarette, leaves John's house and no evidence behind.

So, with no memory of this incident, John develops a nicotine addiction.

What would happen then?

Would he somehow know to get cigarettes to feed it? His brain would probably want more nicotine, but he'd have no way of even knowing what exactly he wanted, right? Would he just go crazy wanting something, but not knowing what? Or what would happen?

Actually, now that I type this out, I imagine he'd go through withdrawal symptoms of nicotine and not know why.

However, I might be wrong and I'm still curious, so..

My reasoning is this:  when she was a baby and I was nursing her, she would have allergic reactions from my breast milk because small amounts of what moms eat find their way into the milk.  It took us months of doctors visits and trial/error to figure out what was going on, but eventually we found out she has a handful of very severe allergies.

So now I'm wondering if there's a risk of her having a reaction to semen/vaginal fluids (if she swings that way) when she becomes sexually active.

* Increase sensitivity

* Take effect instantaneously or periodically or something  like that

* Sustain the erection after ejaculation

* Have any negative side effects

* Cause the whole ""4-hour-long-erection-thing"" that commonly

* Have any real benefits when taken by women

* Have any competition - I think it is Cialis (?) Are they basically the same?

* Act the same universally or do some experience different results than others

He never sees her go berserk since it happens while hes at work (5am - 5-7pm) So when I tell him about it he thinks I'm exaggerating. 

I really don't want to bring the dog with us for a number of reasons. We're moving from the desert to a greener state. We pretty much don't have neighbors, so if the dog goes with I'm scared she'll rip the shit out of someone. She HATES people she doesn't know, and she lets them know. Which is great for a guard dog, but not when I can't stop her. 

There's so many things that could go wrong - and in my mind all of them end with us having to put the dog down.

I understand it's a ploy to get people to read through the rules (the curiosity of the brick invites them), but it seems like I'm not getting something about the brick itself (including the fact that you finish reading the rules and never find out anything about the brick - the reason you went there to begin with).
