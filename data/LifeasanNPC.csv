some logs.",CoffeeBox,309,44,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/11i862/skyrim_hearthfire_so_this_guy_wanted_to_buy_some/,"So I'm just doing some work down at the saw mill when out of the corner of my eye I see this guy wearing all jet-black leather hauling ass on his horse towards town. He doesn't slow down when he gets to the gates, just gallops through them, across the bridge, and then (you won't believe this) gallops the damn horse straight up the ramp into the mill.

I'm about to dive for cover, but I'm too stunned to react in time. At the very last second, he reigns the horse in and brings it to a stop about a foot away from me. He dismounts from the horse and with a totally blank look on his face turns to me and says ""I'd like to buy some lumber.""

I'm more than a little freaked out by the whole thing, but I try to play it casual. ""Doing some building, eh? We can deliver them wherever you need."" The guys reaches into his money purse and pulls out a fistful of gold, hands it to me, and says ""I'll take 20 logs."" I let out a little sigh of relief, glad that this is going to be over soon, and I tell him that I'll have them hauled over right away.

Without missing a beat, the guy immediately reaches back into his purse and pulls out more gold. ""I'll take 20 logs."" Why didn't he say he wanted 40 logs? Did he change his mind? Well, whatever. Money is money, I figure. So I tell him the same thing I said before, ""We'll have them hauled over right away.""

Guy immediately pulls out yet **another** fistful of gold and repeats himself. What the hell? We do this again and again, him just pulling out wads of cash over and over like he's caught in some kind of endless loop. I keep taking the money, and promising that we'll deliver right away, but he **never** replies, unless it's to pull out another lump of gold and order 20 more logs.

We do this little routine over a dozen times, at least, just him pulling out gold and buying logs 20 at a time. Then he finally stops, and without saying another word he turns, quickly snatches a butterfly out of the air, rips it in half, shoves both wings into his mouth, gets back on his horse, and then rides it straight into the river.

I awoke in the middle of the night to the silhouette of that brutish man standing over me. Nearly electrocuted him on sight, I was so startled. 

I thought he was going to try to... um... *take advantage of me*. But no. He just asked if I knew a thing or two about Destruction. Being the College's gate guard, I'd hope so! Rubbing the sleep from my eyes I explained that yes, I did indeed know quite a lot about Destruction, but I don't give free lessons. He told me that he certainly had the coin, and he proceed to pay over a thousand gold for lessons. He was a quick learner. *Astonishingly quick*. Come to think of it, I think he absorbed a year's worth of knowledge in about 15 seconds. 

He thanked me, walked over to a corner of my room and crouched. I thought that he had totally lost it, but surely enough, a moment later he disappeared. The things Drevis teaches those illusionists of his, I tell you. I lay down in bed and fell asleep almost immediately. 

And the most terrifying part is that I had this dream about a dozen times last night. Over and over. The same conversation, similar transactions (he paid me a bit more gold during every dream), and the same crouching disappearance technique. I remember it all so vividly that I don't think it could have been a dream, but if it wasn't, were'd the couple... *dozen*... *THOUSAND* gold pieces that he paid me go?

Maybe I did actually give him those lessons. Maybe he stole the gold. It's not like I have any evidence. But I know one thing.

So anyway I am showing him the latest shipment of iron bars from Northwind Mine, when he shoves me a load of gold and buys the whole shipment! Every single bar! I have no idea how he plans to cart this all away, but then he shoves me out of the way of the bellows and starts churning out iron daggers. Not one or two, by the *hundreds*. I only sold him twenty bars, he pulled the other couple of hundred from Sovengarde knows where!

A couple hundred daggers made in *minutes*. Insanity. Well with his pile of daggers just sitting there next to him, he gives me this blank look. Doesn't say a word. He then pulls out his bow. *Well, this is it. Insane new recruit-cum-guildmaster has snapped once and for all.*

He doesn't point it at me though, he turns around and fires a shot straight into the air. He then turns back to me, still this blank look. Like he was expecting something. A good twenty seconds later, I see Nazeem (smug prick), from a good three hundred feet away, receive 2 feet of daedric arrow right through his skull.

I look back at our guildmaster. The iron daggers are gone. Nowhere in sight. He is still giving me this blank look. I have no idea where the daggers have went. And then, he crouches. Looks like a damned fool. At least until he crab-walks a foot backwards and *completely disappears*.

I met my husband in Whiterun as I was walking in the market. We talked for a bit and I told him about my dreams of becoming a merchant. He agreed to get me a Mammoth Tusk in return for a private lesson on bartering. I was already starting to fall for him.

After that I saw him around a few times but he didn't approach me to give me the tusk so I had assumed that he had lost interest in me. Then one day out of nowhere he shows up with the tusk. I gave him the lesson like I promised and while I was doing it I fell completely in love with him.

Then he left again and for the longest time I didn't see him. I greeted him whenever he was nearby though, hoping that he would talk to me. He didn't. Until of course he showed up with an Amulet of Mara around his neck and asked me to marry him. I said yes of course being hopelessly in love with him.

The marriage was quick and we agreed to move into his house in Whiterun. The first surprise of the marriage was when I got there and found another woman living there with him already. I ignored it though, as she told me she was his housecarl and I had already known he was a thane. I told him I was going to open a shop like I had always dreamed and he seemed very happy for me. I cooked him a homemade meal and we spent the night together, happy as could be.

In the morning he took Lydia and left for a month. I spent the whole time worrying, wondering if he was cheating on me or worse if he had been killed.

Then he returned and it was like nothing had ever happened. He asked me for his share of the store money and for a homemade meal and I was so happy he was alive I gave them to him with a smile. It seemed like he was planning to stay now. He spent the first day at the blacksmiths and then came home and we spent two whole days in bed together. He never said a word to that Lydia girl. It was glorious. I thought that he was going to become a blacksmith and stay with me forever. 

It lasted for about a week and then he was gone again just as quickly as before. I was devastated. The only comfort was that he had not brought Lydia with him. We talked about him, and she had told me that she had never slept with him, merely done her duties as his housecarl. I wasn't sure I believed her but it was obvious that she missed him just as much as I did.

Another month later he showed up to grab his share of the store money. He brought with him a very skimpily dressed girl that I recognized as a companion. He was gone before Lydia could even come downstairs to greet him. We cried together that night.

I haven't seen him since (I barely leave the house anymore preferring Lydia as company, and so I don't have to talk about my marriage) but I have heard from several people that he has come into town since then.

My name is Lucia. I used to live on the streets in Whiterun begging for money just to stay alive. Nobody would take me in. Nobody cared. The only person who was nice to me was another beggar named Brenuin. That’s how I spent my days until one day one of the people I was begging from offered to adopt me. He was wearing really cool armour he called “ebony” and he walked right up to me and told me I could live with him. I was so happy I almost couldn’t believe it.
When we got to the house I was a bit scared of it because it was right beside a swamp but I was too happy about finally having a family to care. When I got inside I was greeted by my new mother Mjoll. She hugged me right away and I could just tell it was meant to be. I also met Papa’s steward Aela the Huntress and his bard Sonir. Sonir also sadly mentioned a houscarl that used to live there but was killed fighting with Papa.

When it was late I was sent to bed so Papa and Mommy could go and get what Papa called his “resting bonus” whatever that means.

The next morning Papa was gone again and when he came back I had a sister! I was so happy I almost cried. Then he made yet another trip and I got a dog he called Meeko! I had to pinch myself constantly just to check to see if I was dreaming.

It wasn’t until a week later that I began to wonder if something was up with Papa. 

First of all there’s an entire room of the house we’re not supposed to go into. It’s Papa’s armoury and Papa always keeps the doors shut. So naturally Sophie and I dared each other to go in there to take a look. What we found inside was… it’s hard to describe. There were weapons and armour everywhere, and even as a little girl I could tell that they were valuable. Looking at them was like looking at a dragon’s horde. There were bows that glowed with magic, swords and axes that were bigger than me, staffs that I didn’t even want to touch and armour that looked beyond ancient. I guess I understand why Papa doesn’t want us playing in there but it’s so beautiful. I just can’t help but wonder where he got it all.

The second thing that’s weird about my Papa is that he builds things really fast. I mean *really* fast. One night I went to sleep and when I woke up we had a cellar. It was filled with shrines, a forge, and a mannequin with yet another set of valuable armour on it. 

The absolute weirdest thing though is that he sometimes leaves for a week and then comes back home with entirely new skills. New magic, new ways of fighting, that sort of thing. Once he left for a while and after he came back I saw him walking around the house crouched down for some reason. Ten minutes later Mommy, Aela, and Sonir where walking around in their underwear. They still haven’t put clothes back on for some reason even though it’s really cold. 

He does other weird stuff too like standing completely still for hours, change armour in seconds, and even jumping really high for no reason while he walks. I just don’t understand it.

I love him anyways though. Because he let me into his family. And because he loves me.

1355222615.0,192,self.LifeasanNPC,14nr6f,[Skyrim] My wife and this asshole Khajiit. ,EmptheBear,230,38,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/14nr6f/skyrim_my_wife_and_this_asshole_khajiit/,"My name is Horgeir. I live in the small town of Dragons Bridge where I operate a lumber mill. Ever since the war started demand for lumber has been high so I have been hard at work, and in the evenings I simply want nothing more than to be able to rest and enjoy my mead. Especially my beloved Dragons Breath mead. I went to great lengths to acquire it and it was worth every coin. 

Now, my wife used to be young and pretty and nice. However, she has grown into an old, cold hearted bitch. She constantly calls me a drunk and blames me for spending up all of our money. Which after what she did today is the ultimate definition of irony. 

So, while I was taking a break today at the mill a Khajiit came riding over the Dragon Bridge. This guy was something else I tell you. His fur was black as night and he was covered from head to toe in what looked to be armor made from the scales of Dragons. On his back he wore one of the most deadly looking bows I have ever seen. It looked as if it had been taken straight from one of the realms of Oblivion itself and it seemed to emit an unnatural green glow. That isn't all either. His horse. . . I swear to Talos that it was not of this world. A horse darker than the darkest black with eyes that let off a bright red glow. 

After he crossed the bridge he turned and looked at me. My hair stood on end. This was no normal Khajiit. I don't think this thing was even mortal. He approached and dismounted his horse. He stood next to me and looked me over. The whole situation was rather uncomfortable so I decided to break the silence. 

I smiled at him and said ""You're a well traveled sort, I can tell just by looking at you."" 

He responded with nothing but silence. This situation was growing more awkward by the second. He just stood there, with no emotion on his face staring blankly at me. 

I lifted my cup to my lips and drank as he watched. I spoke again. ""Working hard gives a man a reason for drinking hard. Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine."" 

This time he actually responded. ""Sounds like you're having some trouble with your wife."" He spoke in a thick Khajiit accent. 

I was slightly surprised by the fact that he finally spoke. I sighed and said ""Her name's Olda. If you've met her then you probably already know what I'm talking about.  I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all of Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be."" 

At this he turned and climbed back onto his horse and rode away into the town. It was a strange encounter alright, but I decided to finish up my mead and get back to work and just try to forget about him. I saw him a few other times that day as he rode past the mill heading west out of town and then again a few hours later when he returned. 
At the time I thought nothing of it, but I should have known that cold hearted shrew I call my wife was up to something. 

That evening I headed out of town to where I kept my stash of mead. My wife pours it out when she finds it, so I hide it in a small cave and leave some wolves to guard it. Much to my dismay as I approached the cave I saw their corpses strewn about. A single arrow embedded in each of their skulls. My mead was gone. 

Enraged I ran all the way home. I knew exactly what had happened. I burst through the door to find Olda standing there, my Dragons Breath mead in hand. She screamed at me ""So, you think you can spend up all of our money on mead do you? You lazy, good for nothing drunk!"" With this she threw the bottle of mead into the fire where it shattered. 

She explained to me how that Khajiit came and spoke to her, and she hired him to find my stash of mead for her. Here is the kicker, SHE PAID HIM SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOLD AND YET I AM THE ONE THAT WASTES ALL OF OUR MONEY?

I didn't care about politics, and since Whiterun was neutral in the civil war, I couldn't care less. I told him to sit down by the fire and I would send someone to serve him, but that asshole walked straight to my bard, and after about a 10-second conversation, the two of them start brawling inside my fucking inn. Inside my fucking inn! Bards can't fight, and the brawl ended in less than a minute. Mikael fell on the floor and stood back up. Something about a promise with the woman outside in the market. Anyway, that got my eyes on that bastard. 

This asshole then walked to the corner of my inn to one of my daily customers, and after another 10-fucking-seconds conversation, the two of them started brawling again! Uthgerd lasted longer than my bitchy bard, but still lost to this bastard who was obviously picking a fight with everyone. Uthgerd then paid this bastard for beating her up. 

This ""brawler"" finally sat down next to the fire. Sinmir turned to him and gave him his usual ""Whiterun Guard"" rant, and I saved him from that awful conversation by telling my Redguard servant to serve him. Saadia did her job fine, but that asshole told Saadia something, and the two of them went upstairs. Not only did that asshole beat up my bard and one of my customers, he took my servant away from her work shift! I waited for a while and was considering to go up to make sure they weren't up to no good, but ""brawler"" came down and left my inn. I let out a sigh, but later I found out that Saadia wouldn't leave her room! I worked my ass off and wanted to have a sip of my Argonian Ale, but it went missing! I swore to Talos I placed it in the kitchen.

Bastard came in the later that night and went up to Saadia, and the two of them left the inn. I never saw Saadia again, and she still had the wage I paid her! I heard that ""brawler"" joined the Companions, but I saw that as a good thing, because Talos know what he would do if he spent a night in my inn!

I didn't see ""brawler"" for a while, but he apparently became the hold's Thane and bought a house in Whiterun. He came in a few weeks later and kept asking me about recent rumors, so I finally bullshited something about the Jarl's son, and hoped that he wouldn't tell report me to the guards for spreading rumors about the Jarl. Just before he left, some shady man in black robes challenged him to a drinking competition. After three cups, he muttered some gibberish and ran out of my inn crying something about a staff. The shady man chuckled and followed out. I couldn't give more shit about it. 

He came in again after another week or so, and told Uthgerd that he needed help. They left together and I never saw Uthgerd ever again. So I lost my servant and a customer to this bastard.

It was probably a couple of months when he came in again, this time wearing a tight black suit. I tried not to laugh as he walked past me and to the room at the far side of the inn. I wanted to tell him that the room's Breton guest didn't want to be disturbed, but I would love to see him getting kicked out. He closed the door after he went in. A minute or two after that, he came back out. The Breton didn't come out after a few days, so I went in to check on him. Turns out he was dead inside his room. Naked and not a single item on him.

""Hellooo?""  I say.  A rat scuttles across the floor.  It is not a test subject.  I shoot the rat anyway.  It gives me something to do.

It has now been a few hours since I shot the rat.  There have been no test subjects passing through the test chamber.  If robots could be bored I would be bored.  But I am a robot so I am not bored.

Suddenly I hear another turret.  

""Is anybody there?""  Then the other turret begins shooting.  Somebody is there.  

If robots could be excited, I would be excited.  But I am a robot so I am not excited.  Instead of feeling excited I prepare for the test subjects arrival.     

""Helloooo?""  I say again.  I hope it is not another rat.  In the distance I hear the other turret.  

""Shutting down.""  
That means that the test subject has deactivated the other turret.  If robots could be sad I would be sad.  But I am a robot so I am not sad.  I hear the test subject come closer but I cannot yet see it.

""Could you come over here?""  I ask the test subject politely.  I need it to come over here so I can kill it.  The test subject comes into view.  I shoot at the test subject.  A few bullets hit it.  The test subject ducks out of sight.

""Are you still there?""  I hope the test subject is still there.  I hear it fire the portal gun.  The test subject then peeks around the corner and fires the portal gun onto the wall behind me.  

""There you are.""  I say.  I shoot at the test subject and it ducks back out of sight.  I suddenly realise I am now in trouble.

The test subject is likely to travel through the portal and come out behind me.  If I could turn around I would be able to shoot the test subject easily.  But I cannot turn around.  This is not good.  There is a high chance the test subject will deactivate me.

Sure enough a few seconds later I am lifted off the floor by the test subject who had sneaked behind me.  If I was not a robot I would be scared.  But I am a robot so I am not scared.

""Put me down!""  Perhaps if I act like I am scared the test subject will not deactivate me.  I try to make my guns face backwards so I can shoot the test subject but they will not rotate that far. 

The test subject drops me on the floor and I fall on my side.  

""AAAGHHHH"".  I will deactivate in a few seconds.  I fire my guns wildly.   I don't want to deactivate.  Am I scared?  I feel scared but I am a robot so surely I cannot be scared.  

A few bullets hit the test subject and it stumbles backwards.  It then runs behind a corner, out of my range.  It was only trying to stay alive.  I was only doing my job and the test subject was only doing its job.  
""No hard feelings,"" I sigh.  Then I deactivate.  ",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1ga7mf,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1ga7mf/portalportal_2_life_of_a_turret/,

I'm talking to my steward and bodyguard, just discussing whatever's been happening, the ongoing civil war and how my city guards have been doing.

I hear our giant main door open, and in walks this guy. What a class act. He's dressed up in steel plate armor, so he must be some kind of adventurer. He must have just come back recently, his sword is dripping blood all over my newly cleaned floor. He sprints his way up the steps and looks at our tables for a second.

Here's the crazy part. He shouts the loudest shout I've ever heard, and all the silverware and food on our table goes *flying*. I'm so shell-shocked, I have no idea what to do. I muster a feeble ""Watch what you're doing!"" and he just stares at me for a second. He sprints up to me and stops not a foot from my face, and, I shit you not, asks me to be a thane in my court.

Now, technically, he hasn't done anything illegal yet, so I tell him, still a little freaked out, that he'll have to help out a significant number of my people (total bullshit, half of the thanes in Skyrim are pompous aristocrats from wealthy families) and buy a house. He turns and sprints away without a single word, leaving me there with my mouth open. I dismiss him as a nutjob and head to bed for the night.

The next day, he comes in *again*. Talos, what does he want now? He throws something like 15,000 gold in my steward's hands and tells him to give him the deed to a new house, complete with renovations and an alchemy lab. He turns to me and told me he's helped my people and expects to become a thane now. I check with the guard standing next to me, and what do you know, he's helped like 7 of my citizens with whatever they needed. I wasn't about to tell this magic shouting guy to go away, so I gave him an axe from my armory, a housecarl, and the title of thane. And, same as last time, he runs off again. 

A few hours later a half-dead guard stumbles in and tells me that someone killed half the town and almost my entire force of guards. This certain someone used my axe and magic shouting to do the deed. I guess he decided that he'd had enough fun for one day, and surrendered to the guards. He spent *one* night in jail and went off on his merry fucking way.

I checked the Nordic book of laws, and sure enough, any crime committed in Skyrim can be dismissed with an amount of gold proportional to the crime, or one night in jail.

But I am not dead.

My underground adventures led me to the depths of this strange earth. My never-ending search for precious stones brought me to that lake of fire. Little did I know that the lake would be my grave.

But I am not dead. No tomb holds me.

The massive diamonds that drove me to craft a bridge of dirt across that firey divide still lay locked in stone. Just out of reach. Who would've thought that a simple misstep at the edge would result in so much pain? No words describe the agony of heat and flame that melted my flesh and ended my life.

But I am not dead. My bones remain.

My worldy possessions met the same fate as my fragile form. All but my bow and quiver of arrows; thrown from my hands as I lost my step. These items hold faint memory of who I once was. I will keep them. 

A spider, jet black, eyes of that same red flame. Out of the darkness it creeps. Mortal enemies no longer. It approaches my rattling, bleached fingers. Skittering legs turn the creature to its side. Does it bend down? Am I to ride this creature of the dark abyss?

How much time has passed? The spider has come and gone and come again. It brings others with it. Some are spiders. The others are more dark. Fiendish. The spiders live their lives. They have grown old and died and new generations have come to accept me as friend and rider. Some part of me misses the first. But that part has grown so small of late. Sadness is replaced with anger. Why am I here? I remember. I died.

But I am not dead. 

A noise. Like crumbling sand. Rocks and dirt. A light breaks through. A figure wrought in iron emerges from the wall. What creature seeks the dark abyss? The lake of fire and death? Why does a faint memory tug at the corners of ancient past? Anger flushes the faint tug away. The creature seeks the diamonds I sought to claim so long ago. They are mine. 

The young spiders die in their assault with me against the creature. Arrow after arrow I fire from my withered bow. The spider I ride is cut from under me. Another arrow finds its mark in the creature's side. It crumples. I feel another tug of distant memory. It mimics a forgotten feeling. What does victory mean? The creature stirs. My fight is not over.

But wait... Those eyes. They are not the same. The creature that rises from amidst the strewn remains spilled upon death is not the same that fought before. Mumbled moans escape the lips that already show signs of decay. Perhaps the creature truly is dead. Impossible. It moves. It shares my fate. But not my fate. The flesh remains. Lifeless eyes stare at me. I see a look only briefly grasped as hunger. No help can I offer this new creature. No flesh remains on my dusty bones. I died.

Well, I was a traveling merchant anyway.  Had a pretty nasty run in with a Death-Claw about a year ago.  I don't know how the hell I survived but I suppose I got pretty lucky.  I ended up finding this huge boat that had a pretty large bridge connected to it, decided to check it out.  Long story short I found my new home.
 
I can't really move around all that great because of the Death-Claw injuries, so I stay here for the most part.  I've lived in Rivet City for just over a year now.  I know it's not the nicest place, but at least I can call it home.  
 
No one lives for free though, I started a little store in the market area of the ship.  Because of my injuries I've hired someone to do the gathering for me.  That's not really the point though. 
 
Some new guy in full Tesla armor walked in one day and starting asking me about his father and such.  He wouldn't even believe me when I had told him I haven't even left the ship in over a year! 
 
This guy buys every single thing I have in stock after convincing me to sell it all for over 80% off, you don't really want to deny a guy in Tesla armor any service. After all that he just sells a bunch of random shit to me that no one would ever want and leaves.  
 
Thank god he's gone though, right? - WRONG. 
 
This asshole comes back like 2 days later with like 500 pounds of the most random stuff and forces me to buy it yet again.  Of course he buys all the good stock I have.  Why would I even want surgical tubing and a child toy car, right? 
 
He repeats this process over and over, sometimes he even sleeps directly in front of me on the floor waiting for me to make just enough caps to pay for the rest of his junk. 
 
It's ruining my damn life!

Yesterday I was driving my jeep down the coast with my brothers when we came upon one of Vaas’s camps.  I guess I wouldn’t call it a camp, more of a shanty town.  The guys that hang out around these places are always fucking crazy; like keeping live tigers and shit in cages.  Anyways, they start taking shots at us and we immediately take cover and start returning fire.  I’m crouched in the bushes clenching my shark fetish necklace, praying to Citra that I don’t die.  I’m getting a few shots off, but we’re severely outnumbered.  There’s like seven of these bitches. 
 
Then, out of nowhere, I see the lock explode off of a cage that’s holding a fucking grizzly bear.  I look around to see what the hell happened and about 100 yards away I see this crazy mother fuckin’ white boy.  He’s got a sniper rifle slung over his shoulder, sprinting toward the camp.  In no time at all, he hops on top of a shack, shimmies across the roof, unslings his rifle and takes a shot at an inebriated fool trying to burn the fucking bear with a Molotov cocktail. He must have hit the bottle itself because this idiot is immediately covered in flames; lighting himself on fire and a couple of buildings along with him.  

Meanwhile, this bear is mauling the shit out of these assholes.  They are shooting all over the place, barely missing each other.  

Whitey jumps from the roof right onto this one mother fucker and stabs him in the neck while at the same time pulling a doll’s head, a wad of bills, and a knife out of this dude’s pants, then throws the knife at the last fucker alive.  This is all before the body even hits the ground. 

Now it’s just him and the bear. Snow White whips out a blood red Shredder with the biggest ass clip I’ve ever seen.  I guess if you’ve got the bullets you’ve got nothing to be afraid of.  Fifteen shots later, he’s crouched down, knife in hand, skinning the shit out of this bear.  He shoves the bloody pelt into his homemade backpack and then is up and running again.  This kid doesn’t stop!

After seeing all this, my adrenaline is up and I’m feeling pretty awesome.  I’m thinking that I’m the MAN!  But then he steals my jeep and I realize I don’t have a way to get home.  Damn.

All I know is that after a seemingly endless void of emptiness, that one day I was able to walk forth onto an unusual land.

I was on a road and I could see others just as confused as I. Regardless of the situation I pushed on and made my way to the gate in the distance; winding back and forth between the narrow pavement road which inevitably led me to my destination.

As soon as I reached the gates I noticed that the people ahead of me were going in freely without obstruction, I proceeded to enter through the gates as many did before me.


-----


I suddenly realize where I am; an amusement park.

Aside from the rides the park itself was incredibly dirty with no signs of garbage bins or brooms-men. I continued to walk down a dirty road which seemed to lead into a dark building. I slowly realize that I cannot walk off the pavement; as hard as I tried I could not bring my feet off the walk-ways of the park... almost as if I were magnetized to the ground beneath.

There were so many people, but the most unusual thing was that I would just pass through everyone as if I were a ghost. Everyone walked in a straight line and just went through another as if the laws of physics did not apply... 



Am I dead? Am I in heaven? 

As I ponder about my location I suddenly realize that I have come to a dead end, instinctively for some unknown reason I suddenly get in a line with about 200 other people.

I look up and see what I am waiting for, a roller coaster with one ""dip"" that reached over 100m; apparently it had just opened up. 

-----

By the time the line shortens and I'm the 10th person in line the machine starts to play distorted music and the current riders of the coaster crash into another ride because the brakes failed to stop the moving cart...

In an instant I turn around and everyone in the line starts walking in reverse fashion; leaving. I do take one glance behind me, expecting a mechanic to be on his way to repair the giant behemoth, instead I see nothing but a empty field; as if the ride had never even existed at all.



I talk to someone beside me,


*""Dude you see that SCARY COASTER #55?!?""*
*""There was an accident! No way I'm going on that!""*




I turn back to the field to see the very same coaster in the same spot. While I didn't line up this time, I did take a look at the name of the ride: *""SCARY COASTER #56""*

The man that once stood beside me was off on a hurry to get in line again. I catch very vaguely what he says before leaving earshot-distance:


*""Oh wow look at that ride, SCARY COASTER #56! It's nice and new!~ Looks safe and fun!""*



-----



After that weird hiatus I return back to the food-court section of the park. I find it rather shocking that everything in the park is free, the rides, the food, and even umbrellas.

I start to look through the food stalls.


Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.

Burger Bar.


I decide that I am not hungry...

Oh wait, a Drink Stall.


Not a moment later my bladder is full and my quest for the washroom begins. I find one quite quickly with only 1 person in line.

I step right behind the man and being to wait. As I wait I start to look around and notice an unusual sign on the washroom...


*""Service Charge: $300""*


I stop lining up and decide that I should find an atm.



-----



I do not even know where I am inside the park anymore. This place is huge, my logbook says I've been here for 10 years now.

For 10 years I rode rides and ate burgers, while unable to go to the bathroom due to my lack of finances; I have tried to leave the park but every-time I get a map and try to get to the exit, a sign saying *""No Access""* keeps stopping me.


I cannot cry or die. I am stuck in this world for eternity.


For 10 years I collected information about myself and reality, trying to make sense of everything. But in the end the only two sentences I had written down in my logbook were these:



*I am a Guest.*

*I am Guest #456.*

I don't know if it's in the air or the water that is making my mind go. I remain somewhat more articulate than...I guess they're my brothers. What do you call a group of bandits that are lead by a vault hunter? We're not heroes by any mean, we right no wrongs, we solve no problems. All we seem to do is fight with the other bandits at Sawtooth Cauldron. We raise a flag, they take it down, they raise a flag, we take it down. I can't understand why we fight these turf wars rather than just becoming allies. Then again, it beats listening to the Buzzard pilots drone on and on about their flights and how they can take a dump in mid-air. It was funny the first time...all those years ago.

I see the madness taking hold in them, one by one. Men who I knew to be good and sensible are now just obsessed with killing. It has come to such a point that it feels all they know are a few phrases about stripping the flesh off of anyone who comes near. Sure, we all do our best to make our mask filter out whatever it is that makes our minds go, but it always seeps in. Maybe it isn't in the air at all, maybe it's the thought of that vault, that's what floats around on the air. Not a pathogen of Pandora, but an idea, the idea of the vault holding the answer to all of life's problems.

I had a friend not too long ago, the madness got him too. He made himself one of those masks that the psychopaths wear, and stopped wearing his shirt. I stayed around him, protecting what was left of my friend, hoping one day his mind would come back. I never got the chance to find out. One day when we were looking for, well, anyhting we could get our hands on, he was torn in half by a bullymong. It threw both halves at me right before I managed to kill it. I kept his mask, mainly because it helps me feel less alone. The worst part is, I can't even remember his name, all I can think is how finding the vault might have helped him, helped fix our lives.

Maybe that's why more vault hunters came to Pandora. Jack kills most of them, but I hear of four that survived. How long before they are taken by the madness as well. The first four vault hunters are still here. Our leader is, or was, one of them. They found a vault and all it had was some monster. Why do they stay now though? Do they have the same madness that is gripping all of us? Can they not leave the planet? They did great things but can't seem to leave, all their power and might worth nothing. They're still slaves to the vault like the rest of us. If their might and power can't over come the madness, how can I? I can already feel it in my head. How long until I am no more than a screaming violent psychopath? I can't let this happen. There's only one way out of this, and I can't say I like it. But how? I don't think I can take being ripped apart by the animals of Pandora. Then again, we *are* on a huge cliffside, but I'm not sure if I can bring myself to do it. 

I hear gunshots.

The new vault hunters have arrived. This may be how I go. I don't want to attack them though, I don't think I could take being shot to death either, or stabbed, or whatever that hovering ball thing is. No, I want one clean shot in the head. Is this the madness talking? Do I want to live if this is what my mind may become? No, I want this. Maybe, I'll get back what I used to have before Pandora. I'll wear my friend's mask so I don't have to be so alone, so they won't see the terror and regret in my eyes. My best course of action is to probably just act as insane as possible and demand to be shot in the face. I don't want to go out begging, no, I don't want their pity, just one bullet to the face. I should get to a good spot. 

They're drawing closer. There's a lot of death around me, I soon hope for it to wash over me, wash me away from Pandora.

I travel this route every day to sell my crops and wheat. Suddenly, out of no where, this bulgy man came running up to me in a fancy suit of armor. Typical adventurer, I figured. He stopped and gave me this blank look, so I gave him a casual greeting. No response. He just continued to look at me, with this blank expression...then he turned his head and seemed to look off of the cliff we were standing next to. He then looked at me again, then looked back off the edge of the cliff. He continued this exchange for quite a while, trying to decide on what to do by the looks of it. Odd, I thought...

...and suddenly, the bloody guy opened his mouth and SHOUTED this incomprehensible gibberish, FOOT ROW DOCK or something of the sort, but that's not the weird part. His shouting released such a force of wind that I was shot straight off the edge of the cliff, tumbling more than 60 feet down into the river below and breaking nearly every bone in my body. Before I passed out, I could see the man at the top of the cliff, glancing at my limp body. He seemed to be wearing a malevolent smirk. ""Impossible,"" I thought. He then proceeded to leave down the path, but not before giving out a muffled childish giggle to himself.

""I hear you deliver letters,"" a husky female voice said softly. I saw a hand, a shimmer of black silk, and heard the rustle of leather against the expensive material.  
""That I do, ma'am,"" I agreed. ""Costs five septims, ten if it'll put me in danger.""  
There was a pause while I looked down at the letter. Then: ""Better make this ten, then. Maybe fifteen.""  
""Whoa, ma'am, you shouldn't go talking the price up. No matter the danger, it's only ten septims,"" I said loyally.  
""Oh, really?"" She sounded pleased. ""Ten septims it is, then. The target of this letter is the Dragonborn; she travels a lot, so I can't guarantee that you'll be safe. She's in Whiterun right now, I believe.""  
""Again? Wow, lots of people want letters sent to the Dragonborn,"" I admitted, looking up at the woman. Her face was concealed so that all I could see was her stunning blue eyes.  
It was enough. In my slightly intoxicated state, I felt like I would do anything for her.  
""Hmm. So you know how she looks, then. Good, that means I won't have to describe her."" She chuckled under her mask.  
""She's been wearing daedric armor most of the time,"" I admitted, ""but that stands out in a crowd. Anyway, I found her after she fought a dragon once. I'll remember that Shouting easily.""  
The woman's eyes sparkled. ""Good luck, and remember not to let anyone see that letter."" She dropped a sack of gold on the table and headed away.  
I picked through the bag and found twenty septims. ""Hey, lady, wait! You gave me too much!"" I called out after her.  
She paused at the threshold and looked back at me, eyes dancing with laughter. ""That's your tip."" Then she opened the door and was gone into the night.  
  
I took the letter and headed to Whiterun, purse jingling merrily the whole way. When I arrived, however, the guards were all in a tizzy about something. Just as I got inside, I was grabbed by a sharp-clawed creature. A guard let out a shout of alarm, and suddenly an arrowhead was pointed straight at my face.  
The creature fell away and I realized it was a... something. I couldn't tell. Furry and hulking, it collapsed with the arrow still through its neck. Then, as I struggled to regain my breath, it abruptly staggered to its feet, shake its heavy head, and bounded away with the arrow still through its neck.  
A guard helped me to my feet, shaking his head. ""Damn thing just appeared out of nowhere. We're not sure what to do with a thing like that - such things have happened before, but so rarely that no one is ever prepared. Are you okay?""  
I looked down at myself. My collar was a little ripped where the creature's claws had grabbed me, as was my right arm, but I didn't have any injuries. ""Whew, I'm fine. What was that thing?""  
""We think they might be werewolves,"" the guard admitted.  
""Werewolves! Like in all the myths? I didn't think they were real.""  
""No one thought dragons were real, either,"" the guard looked darkly at me. ""Be careful. Don't hang around the streets.""  
""Oh, that reminds me! Is the Dragonborn here?"" I asked, suddenly remembering my reason for being here. ""I have a letter for her.""  
The guard lifted his helmet a little bit and scratched at his neck. ""Oh, yeah. She went to talk to the Companions a few days ago. Went out to explore some cave with that meat-headed twin. Not sure if she's back yet. Why not stay in the Bannered Mare tonight and ask about her? The locals always have gossip.""  
""Thanks,"" I replied. ""For the news and saving my life.""  
The guard nodded formally. ""Watch the skies, traveler, and remember: no lollygagging.""  
  
The Bannered Mare was comfortably warm and homey, surprisingly. Because I spent most of my time in Falkreath, I had never had the chance to stay in another inn. A young bard proudly belted out ""Ragnar the Red,"" while a serving maid daintily swept the floor, and an elderly man grumbled about Whiterun's security. It was quite pleasant.  
""Do you have any rumors about the Dragonborn?"" I asked the woman standing at the counter, presumably the owner.  
She snorted. ""There are rumors on other topics?"" Seeing my puzzled face, she shrugged. ""In a town where the Dragonborn is Thane and owns a house and is part of the Companions, there is little else to talk about."" She extended a hand to me warmly. ""Sorry about the rude opening. I'm Hulda, owner of the Bannered Mare. As for rumors, well, there's not much recently. Supposedly the Dragonborn was heading out of town on her way to Windhelm to talk to Ulfric. Wants to get a feel for both sides of the war, you see.""  
I tried not to groan. Windhelm was far away and colder than a hagraven's tit.  
Hulda looked sympathetically at me. ""Look, if it's too far a travel, you could just give me the letter. The Dragonborn comes in here often, so I could just give it to her. No sense in putting yourself in danger.""  
I began to reply, but was suddenly cut short by the slurring of a very drunk man. ""Hey, buddy! You a good drinker? I'm Sam, and I bet you this here staff I could outdrink you!""  
I always had fancied myself to stay sober longer than any other Nord while drinking. ""You're on.""  
  
My head still hurt. After sorting out a huge mess with a hagraven, a goat, a giant, a temple of Dibella, and eventually the Daedric Prince Sanguine himself, my hangover only seemed worse. I took some comfort in the fact that I had apparently had a wonderful night, but only a little. My tunic was stained with wine - I didn't have the time to buy a new one, but the stain was faint. The letter was still safe, though, so at least I could finish my job.  
I was finally at Windhelm. Assuming the Dragonborn would only be in one place, I headed for Candlehearth Hall.  
""Dragonborn? Oh, no. She left a while ago - doesn't like Windhelm much. And the town doesn't like her much either,"" the barmaid added darkly. ""Last time she was here, she broke into the Aretino residence and ended up doing something for the boy there.""  
I staggered to the nearest chair. I'd missed the Dragonborn again!  
""You know,"" the barmaid said after a moment, ""She said she was heading for Solitude. If you want to try to catch up to her, on the road is the best place for it.""  
""Thank you,"" I managed, picturing twinkling blue eyes. ""I'll do that.""  
  
As I strode tiredly up the road, wishing I had waited until daytime, I heard a faint roar. Oh, no, I thought, another werewolf, or a frost troll. I'll never see the end of this.  
Then there was a shrieking whinny and over the rise before me, a huge golden horse charged. Lather streamed from his mouth and his pelt was laid open badly - blood glistened wetly on his hindquarters. ""Ahh!"" I let out a cry of shock and threw myself out of his path, coating the front of my tunic in dust.  
The horse neighed loudly again and came to a halt, flanks heaving with effort. As I picked myself up, the roar sounded again - much louder now. And I recognized it.  
A dragon!  
That howl of rage, the scream as it flamed.. I remembered it from the time I'd seen the Dragonborn battle a dragon. But what would a dragon be doing here? They only landed to attack when the Dragonborn was around...  
Ah! She was here then! Absurdly inappropriate joy bubbled up in me as I realized my target was right nearby. If the dragon didn't best her...
""YOL-TOOR-SHUL!""  
A blast of fire exploded over the hill. I struggled to get to my feet just in time to see a black-and-red, spiny humanoid run frantically over the hill - daedric armor, I thought disjointedly. And there, right behind it, was the dragon.  
Its crimson hide glittered as it rose up like a massive daedra, flames clinging to its scales and casting dim, flickering red light over it while smoke billowed from its mouth and nose in an evil black cloud reaching with its dark tendrils to obscure the crescent moons. A vile and sulfuric smell filled the air - the stench of death, my fear-crazed mind babbled - and gleaming golden eyes that smoldered with hate and wrath burned furiously through the choking smog.  
Even as terrible and powerful as it was, the dragon was painfully awkward on land. It hobbled over flame-scorched wings, following the Dragonborn as she ran past me. ""HIO FEN DIR NAAL DII YOLBAH, DOVAHKIIN!"" it bellowed, sending a wave of heat rolling over me and nearly knocking me flat again.  
As the Dragonborn passed me, the dragon turned its head and its small yellow eyes pierced me. A sneer crossed its huge, horned face and it stomped over to me.  
I let out a very un-Nordic scream of terror as it reached down and picked me up in its stinking jaws. Though it did not bite down, its teeth pierced my tunic easily. I kept screaming. It snarled and shook its head a little, as if trying to shut me up, when the Dragonborn spoke.  
""Drop the man now!"" she shouted, and her voice was all at once commanding and furious and full of righteous justice.  
""AHH, DOVAHKIIN, YOU WISH TO DO BATTLE RATHER THAN FLEE? I WILL DROP THIS PATHETIC SCRAP OF MEAT,"" the dragon roared. Then it shook its great heavy head back and forth... and hurled me away.  
As it did so, my poor tunic was torn to shreds. It had held up through a werewolf and a drunken adventure, but to be thrown by a dragon was too much. I hurtled through the air stripped down to my undershorts. Yet, by some miracle, my letter pouch stayed with me.  
My eyes squinted closed as I prepared for the impact that would surely kill me. I tried to remember all my happy moments - meeting the blue-eyed woman in Falkreath was certainly the first to come to mind - and found that I had very few. Maybe I shouldn't have become a courier. But it was too late for that now, of course - I was about to hit the ground and be killed.  
Instead, though, I struck something soft and shaggy.  
""Ouff!"" The air escaped from my lungs in one great rush as I slid down the strange surface to land on my rear in the dust.  
I sucked in air gratefully, but the inhale quickly turned into a painful, whooping cough. Still, I was breathing - far better than how I had expected to fare.  
But what was I leaning against? I felt behind me. Thick, wiry, shaggy fur. A round shape. A huffing sound.  
I had landed on a mammoth.  
I leaned my head back and gazed up at the starry night sky, half of which was obscured by a half-awake mammoth whose back had made an excellent landing pad for a shrimpy, near-naked Nord courier. I was alive.  
Then a sudden burst of flashing color filled the sky, a beautiful yet blinding array of vivid, pulsating hues that shimmered against the stars. I had seen this once before - it was the Dragonborn. She had slain the dragon and absorbed its soul.  
Oh! But I had to deliver my letter to her! I tried to climb to my feet and found that it was incredibly difficult to do so. Entangling my hand in long mammoth fur, I managed to stagger up and start limping towards the array of lights. The mammoth, my savior, simply snorted and went back to sleep while a hulking giant stood guard nearby should a real threat have revealed itself.  
The Dragonborn was snapping charred and blackened bones off of the dragon's ribcage when I reached her, but she turned to look at me. With one hand, she reached up and pulled off her daedric helmet to reveal the slender and puzzled face of an Altmer woman who was looking at a nearly-naked courier offering her a letter.  
I didn't bother trying to explain. ""I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only."" Before she could speak, I rushed on. ""Don't know who it's from - they wore a shrouded cloak that covered their face."" Except for their eyes. ""Here you go."" I offered the letter, and one clawed gauntlet reached out to take it. The Dragonborn unfolded it and read it, and her face darkened.
Nervously I said, ""Looks... looks like that's it. Uh, got to go."" With that, I fled to find the nearest town and get a new tunic.  
  
""Ya know, buddy, yer oooookay,"" the farmer slurred cheerily. ""Not one 'a those crazy... those crazy...""  
""Black-Briar drinkers,"" his neighbor supplied.  
""Thassit, yeh, thassit,"" he agreed with a hearty laugh. ""I like this guy here cuz' he drinks Honningbrew Mead. An' he's gen'rous!""  
I had found a small town nearby and managed to find an old tattered tunic to wear until I could buy a proper one. Then I'd headed to the inn so I could drink away the night. The two farmers sitting with me, Ranor and Frelli, were drunk and all too happy to share mead with me. My head was buzzing pleasantly, on the edge of intoxication.  
""Ya know what, we oughta go walk aroun' Skyrim an' share this great mead with ev'ryone,"" Frelli announced. ""Ev'ryone should get ta taste Honningbrew.""  
""Hey, yer on the right track,"" Ranor agreed. ""Whaddaya think, pal, ya wanna preach the vir.. vir..."" he trailed off, unable to remember the world.  
""Virtue?"" I suggested.  
He laughed hugely and threw an arm around my shoulders with a grin. ""Thas' the one!"" His breath was rank, but all three of us reeked of alcohol. It was wonderful.  
""We c'n be the Happy Guys,"" Frelli suggested.

I was going to be Thane, you know. Paperwork filled out and everything. I suppose the Dovahkiin *did* take down a dragon (what about the other soldiers with him?) and saved Whiterun. Can't really say *I've* done that.

I was still *damned* excited to go adventuring with him. And for a few weeks, I did. But it turns out, I don't stealth very well in my clanky steel armor, so he sent me to his home, where I now reside, twiddling my thumbs.

Breezehome was actually pretty decent. It had a fire, bunch of garlands hanging on the walls, even a kitchen. Was definitely nicer than my living quarters in Dragonsreach. However, I did miss discussing ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the great warriors. Made me feel accomplished.

After a few months of counting the average amount of embers the fire releases per minute, a girl in skimpy leather armor walked through the door, accompanied by the Dragonborn. I placed her as one of those Companions over by Dragonsreach. She seemed fairly agile, was probably who he traveled with nowadays.

I was proven wrong when the Dovahkiin immediately left, and the Companion begun stirring the pot in the cooking spit above the fire. Apparently she was his wife now.

She used to be tough, I remember. Didn't take guff from anybody. Now, she's been reduced to a drooling, brainwashed mess of what she was. She still believes the Dragonborn loves her (he only stops by to take money from a store he doesn't even know the name of).

I laughed.

It was Tirdas, I think. Day was going like any other day in this positively *boring* house. I was sleeping in my quarters, when I heard the front door open.

Now, you have to understand, this wasn't uncommon. Like I said before, he was probably back home to get his *share* of Aela's money, maybe a homecooked meal. I was just getting back to sleep when I heard the loudest noise I think I've ever heard.

Clattering, crashing, the works. And the air was filled with a... peculiar scent. Was that...?

Yup. Cheese. Somehow, he had managed to cover half of the first floor with rolls and rolls of cheese, and he was slapbang in the middle of it, with that stupid blank expression on his face. I couldn't even see Aela.

I hate my life.

In a bar full of people on a rainy night in this busy town, I sit alone at a table and wonder what you are doing. My drink has been half empty for the longest time. I don’t want to finish it because I don’t want to leave. I want you to be sitting beside me, your face alight with some adventure you’ve just had, your arms moving reliving the exciting parts. Your dark hair falling in your face and your honey coloured eyes dancing.

I miss you. Various drunks keep trying to chat me up even though they know me and they know you and they know I usually come in here with you.

I could go home, but the house is so empty. And the dog is with you, which I don’t mind, I know how much he loves the trips, but it helps to see his face when I walk in the door.

Are you thinking of me? Are you wondering what I am doing, or are you too busy somewhere doing that thing you do so well. 

I try not to worry, I know you’ll come home and be fine, but one day, I wonder if I’ll just carry on sitting here, waiting for a man who never comes. A man who has shown me a world full of danger and excitement the likes I never dreamed of. 

The room is warm and the faces familiar. It smells of ale and roast goat. Shall I go home and sit by your bed and wait for you? Wait for the door to open and the sound of weapons stacked and armour dropped, the dog ahead of you, climbing the stairs and pushing his wet nose into my hand. 

And you will arrive and fall exhausted on to the bed and I will join you and sometime later we will awake feeling a lover’s comfort and you will call me your mountain flower, your blessing, your love, your Lydia.

He walks around, trades with a few of us, And proceeds to build himself a little dirt shack on the outskirts of town(Like I said, he's a little special.)

He then does the impossible, He walks over to the nearby forest and cuts down a tree. WITH HIS BARE HANDS. He then proceeds to somehow process the wood into planks and a crafting table, still using nothing but his bare hands.

Now that he's got his crafting table he makes an axe and starts chopping down the forest, slowly putting the entire thing into his pocket.

He lugs the entire forest back to his dirt shack and goes inside, Making a door.

He's wearing diamonds across his entire body, and he's holding a sword of the same material. He walks towards the blacksmith and says ""Trade"". The blacksmith offers him the usual iron sword for 3 emeralds deal, Then the mutant does something that will haunt me forever.

He simply looks at the blacksmith, with an emotionless face and says ""Bad trade"". He pulls out a bucket full of -GET THIS- Lava, and pours it all over the blacksmith's building, we hear the blacksmith scream for a few seconds and he walks away from the burning building.

He does this systematically to everyone he encounters, sometimes he lets them live and keep their home, sometimes they are burned alive by lava. Sometimes they are blown apart by tnt, sometimes he pulls out a fishing pole and throws them in the well, leaving them to drown.

It was listed as a heart transplant, which should have been easy enough, but I think the doctor had Down's Syndrome or Parkinson's Disease or something. The first thing he did was flick a scalpel off onto the floor, grab a bone saw, sever a couple of arteries and get his watch stuck on the patient's rib cage. That was before he tried to remove the fragments of bone he'd created when he began *bashing* the rib cage with the bone saw.

After he dropped the bone saw, he picked up a syringe and began stabbing the patient with it, over and over, before he dropped it into the patient's chest cavity. For some odd reason, he thought it'd be a good idea to drop a coffee cup in the cavity too before trying for a good two and a half minutes to touch his thumb to all four of his fingers on his right hand. The patient was still bleeding profusely but the doctor insisted things were well under control.

""Shut up. I got this.""

Well, after picking the pieces of bone out and casually throwing them onto the floor, as well as throwing the watch the doctor had dropped in the patient's chest cavity (not to mention the syringe and coffee cup) across the room, the doctor decided it was a good time to call it a day and stabbed the patient repeatedly with another syringe before using pieces of the patient's own rib cage to sever his heart and roll said heart off his torso onto the ground.

I remember wishing for the day I’d get to leave, whether in the company of a Thane or striking out on my own. I’d grown tired of the day-in, day-out routine of the hall - get up, practice with the guards out on the Porch until I can no longer stand the testosterone in the air, meals in the Great Hall trying my best to tune out Proventus’ whining and griping about whatever insignificant matter he’s got his hackles up about today, loiter around the hall until I feel about to die of boredom, go to bed, rinse, repeat...

I was an idiot for ever thinking excitement or adventure could actually be better than that glorious life of normalcy. The worst idiot. *Ever*.


It’s not that I’m not glad to be doing a service to my Hold by lending aid and succor to the noble Dragonborn hero who will save our collective asses from the rising menace of the draconic scourge. It’s just that I’m not sure I’m doing anyone a service by following this... madwoman. She kills! Anything. That even *looks* like it’s giving her the stink-eye. And innumerable deer and goats that don’t. Sometimes she doesn’t even use an axe, like any other sane Nord, no - it’s that uncanny spellwork, fire and lightning like some kind of Thalmor toady elf. The woman will steal anything that’s not nailed down, and if people were in the practice of nailing down things she wanted, I think she’d just rip them up and go on her merry way. Her gods-given gift of the dragon tongue? She uses it to chase butterflies. Or knock people off of mountains. Or knock butterflies off mountains, turn into a ghost, and then jump off the mountain after them - it took me two days to find her after that episode, and she was covered in blood that may or may not have been hers and grinning like a maniac. She gave me fifteen cheese wheels and a Falmer ear. I didn’t ask.


It might have been okay if she inspired any kind of loyalty in me, if I thought she cared if I live or die, but I’m pretty sure when she looks at me she sees, not Lydia-the-talented-and-hardworking-warrior, but Lydia-the-glorified-pack-mule. Every time she looks in my direction, I just know she’s going to hand me whatever dross she’s accumulated since the last time she noticed her pack getting heavy - sometimes it’s books or weapons, sometimes it’s the hundreds of smelly, bloody hides, sometimes it’s the skulls she picks up in ruins, sometimes the dragon bones and scales that I swear must be made of lead they weigh so much. Occasionally she even deigns to let me handle the next set of brooms for her collection. She collects *brooms*. I don’t know what she sees in them, but she has more brooms in her room in Breezehome than I ever thought possible. She usually tells me to wait outside whatever cave or dungeon she wants to pillage next, but occasionally she forgets, and I, for some reason, still follow her in. She’s given me a thousand ways to regret that decision - she “accidentally” swipes me with her sword - “you big baby, I gave you that ebony armor, it can’t have hurt that much” - or “just misses” hitting that bandit mage behind me with an occult bolt of lightning - “your brain runs on that stuff, you know, it’ll probably make you smarter once the muscle tics wear off” - or lectures me for hours after I step on one damn pressure plate that just happens to trigger a spiked gate swinging into her face. I’m sorry, my thane, I was a *little* more concerned with the draugr climbing out of its grave that was probably about to shout your sword out of your hand - remember the last time? You spent hours looking for it. I’m pretty sure smithing a new one isn’t beyond you - swords are not all that different than hundreds upon hundreds of Iron Daggers of Banishing. 


She’s been talking to some suspicious-looking characters lately, like that redhead in Riften selling the fishy-smelling elixir. She actually let me stay home for a while after that episode - muttered something about “tin can, hear her from a mile away” - I don’t even care about the insults anymore, the peace and quiet that followed was pure bliss. She just got back, though - said something about the Emperor being dead? I think we would have heard something like that... Anyway, we’re going somewhere tomorrow - she read some book, “Boethiah’s Proving”, and now she’s off on some hare-brained Daedra-worshipping scheme. I’d really rather stay out of it, but she’s going to command me to follow and damned if I won’t just do my duty like always. Oh well.

The guy gets out of his car and walks into the lobby, takes a look around, then pulls out a MOTHERFUCKING RPG OUT OF NO WHERE and starts blowing the place up. Shit. I haul ass beneath my desk, start praying. I hate this city.

Cops soon arrive, ""thank god"" I think. Nope. The killer hides behind a wall, and every time a cop walks in, he shoots them down. This happens once...twice...ten times...and soon I realize the cops are following each other into the lobby, one after another, like fucking blind lemmings. They nonchalantly step over their coworkers dead bodies and without knowing it, sentence themselves to death. Dumbasses. 

Eventually though, one cop grows a pair and a brain, and throws a grenade at the killer. Can't tell if it's a skilled or lucky throw, but the grenade blows and kills the killer nonetheless. 13 dead patients, 32 dead cops (probably for the better of the city considering their lack of a brain). I think it's over. Nope.
The cops walk over to the dead body, then drag him right over to the ER room and order some doctors to fix him up. A few minutes later, the guy had somehow come back to life...and then they LET HIM GO. Right at the door of the hospital. To top it all off, they didn't even confiscate his stash of an RPG, machine gun, rifle, knife, and flamethrower.

So what does the guy do? Before the cops had even left the building, he turns around and starts shooting up the place again.

Oh, look. A new guy. You've even got a suit! Don't tell me, you're a good cop.

Mr. Peters. Even giving me a name. Good cop all the way, huh? What do you want from me?

Wow. You're not serious, are you?

Do you honestly think you're gonna take back the Mojave from her? Look me in the eye, yeah, the one your friends haven't punched into bloody pulp, and tell me with a straight face that you and the rest of the NCR are going to take back what's ours.

You're wrong. I was NCR. Not any more.

For fuck's sake, I've told every interrogator the story. 

You wanna hear it again? Fine.

So it was after the second battle of Hoover Dam. I was Warrant Officer Kurt Frost, attached to 2nd Recon. Our job was to sweep through areas where Legion forces were still resisting. Now, I'd heard that that woman had personally subdued six Veteran Rangers and chucked General Wait-And-See Oliver right off the edge of the dam, but somehow she'd managed to smooth-talk Major General Webley into working with her. 

No, I wasn't there, and Webley still says that he did it of his own accord. No blackmail, no threats, nothing.

Anyway, I was on patrol with my two squadmates, Lance Corporal James Sandy and Gunnery Sergeant Daria Torres. We were sweeping through what had been Khan territory, now taken over by Legionnaires who were using the single valley entrance as a chokepoint. Our job was to scale the cliffs and keep an eye on their movements- while they weren't going anywhere, we'd have to clear them out sooner or later and NCR command wanted better intel. Turns out they had their eye on us the minute we came near Red Rock Canyon- we though we had the element of stealth and surprise, but I suppose that wasn't the case.

We were halfway up a smaller cliff face when I heard the first volley of shots ring out. Cheap cowboy repeaters that wouldn't be able to bust through our armour, was my first thought, when I heard a scream. Sandy got hit in the hand, let go of his cable and slammed into the ground, face first. Probably died as he hit the ground. Torres and I got lucky- we managed to get back onto solid ground without taking any serious injuries. We were quickly surrounded, managed to kill a few of 'em, but there were just too many of them. 

I woke up later, wearing only my shirt and jeans; my armour and weapons were nowhere to be found. Torres was the same. Thankfully, they hadn't roughed us up much. I guessed correctly that they wanted to use us as hostages, and while they certainly weren't nice to us, it was nothing a Ranger couldn't handle. We had water, gruel, and they didn't beat us often enough for me to really complain.

Days passed, and I got to looking around. You forget, Mr. Peters, that when you've been in the buisness of killing for country as long as I have that you learn things. You realize that the people you fight with, the people you fight against- they're not all one big group of people with the same ideas. I saw some legionnaires there who couldn't have been older than eighteen, ninteen. I looked around and saw these kids, wandering around aimlessley, terrified of what the next day would bring. Terrified that everything they'd learnt, everything the Legion had drilled into them, might just be bullshit. So there were the younger ones, the confused ones, that was maybe just under half of them. 

And then there were the ones who'd done this shit for so long that the very concept of fear of defeat just pissed them off more. Those were the ones who would beat us. This is important.

So six days passed, and nothing happened. A week after we'd been captured, this big fucking legionnare, called himself Grumio, popped in front of us carrying a radio. He said that my superiors wanted a word with me. So Torres and I got on the radio, and there was Lieutenant General Church.

You know what that son of a bitch told me? He told me that we were simply no forces available to help. Said we were stretched too thin, that our special forces were 'unable to spare the capacity to carry out a rescue operation in this time of crisis.' I heard Webley in the background. He was yellin' about how the demands the legion were making were reasonable- to simply face a fair trial and to ensure the safety of the younger soldiers- and that surely the lives of NCR troops mattered more than petty vengeance.

And Church fucking ordered Webley to shut the fuck up. Church congratulated us on our performance, said we'd be honoured with full military burials and posthumous promotions, and that they planned on blowing up the entrance to the canyon and letting us fucking starve to death.

Grumio asked me what my rank was. Turns out he was more or less a Warrant Officer himself, and that he was the highest ranking officer in the camp. He shook his head, and apologized. It was an understanding between old soldiers. That us ground pounders get fucked by the brass. He told me we'd be taken care of as prisoners of war to the best of their means until the end.


It was less than an hour later when we heard it. Torres and I were planning our escape, wondering what we'd do when there was a clear voice of a megaphone.

It was HER.

A woman's voice, at once warm and welcoming, yet supremely confident. Each word was rolled into the next. I'm no poet, Mr. Peters, but I know a good, what's the word, orator? Orator, when I hear one.

""Legionnaires of Red Rock Canyon. Caesar is dead, his head mounted in my trophy case. Legate Lanius, Monster Of The East, fled like the coward he is.""

""I am the Courier you know as Sylvia. I ask that you release the hostages you have taken. Do this now, and I will personally ensure that all of you face a fair trial under the laws of the New Mojave.""

""You have an hour to surrender to my forces. Those who surrender will face a future of cooperation and safety. Know that in an hour, there will be no trial. ""

This is when her voice lost all trace of the kindness and warmth. Then there was only this rage, this fury, this bloodlust. You could hear it in her voice, and it terrified me. And there's not much that scares me, Mr. Peters.

""There will be no trial, no surrender, no mercy. I will wade through your camp, and you shall know my hatred. I shall slaughter until Red Rock Canyon is filled with your blood and corpses. In the end, I will stand upon a mountain of your skulls and your only comrades will be the ravens that pick the flesh from your bones. You have one hour.""

Yes, word for word, Mr. Peters. That was the first time I'd ever heard the Courier speak in person, and I can plainly tell you that I was no longer NCR that very second. I remember it because it was terrifying. It was the voice of someone who had authority over life and death, someone who gave mercy with one hand and death with the other.

Anyway, I saw Grumio arguing with a bunch of other officers, and he shot a few of 'em. Told the younger soldiers to leave now, to go and find their lives. That left, oh, I dunno, forty or so legionary veterans. Grumio grabbed a megaphone once the younger kids had left.

""Those who wished to surrender have done so, Courier. The rest of us, you shall have to kill. Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant!""

And less than five minutes later, we were free. 

Yes, I know how utterly ridiculous that sounds. That's what I thought. One woman, take out forty veterans? 

Trust me, Mr. Peters. You can ask Torres. That woman walked right through explosives and landmines, sprinting so fast she was a goddamn blur. The explosions never even touched her. She was wearing some sort of modified Ranger armour that their bullets seemed to barely scratch. She carried some sort of assault rifle and a machete at her side. She fucking walked into the middle of the camp, and in the span of two or three seconds managed to score headshots on thirty legionnaires.

Yes. You heard me right. Thirty shots, thirty kills.

That left about ten soldiers, and that's when she drew her machete. That woman fought like nothing I've ever seen. She moved faster than anybody has any right to and shrugged off blows that would have cut another man's arm in two. Hell, at one point somebody slashed her exposed arm and I swear to god the machete made a metallic 'clang' and bounced off her skin. Grumio, last one standing, charged at her, and she just flipped him onto the ground and stabbed him in the neck.

And that was it. One woman, covered in blood, and forty dead legionnaires. She took off her helmet, and there she was. Asian, short hair, with telltale pale skin- someone who didn't take their helmet off very often. She was pretty, looking almost motherly, except, you know, she was covered in blood and shit.

She helped us up, brought us back to that swanky casino in the Strip. The 38. Asked Torres and I if we wanted to fight for an independent Vegas.

I accepted in an instant.

You might not know it, Mr. Peters, but she's really quite something. I don't think I've seen her ever stop. Always doing something. Hell, every day she's busy. Helping the poor, killing bandits and raiders, overseeing defences, negotiating treaties...she's a force of nature. Maybe you'll understand on-

No, don't worry about that. That explosion was probably her.

No, I'm NOT kidding.

Don't look so surprised. You think I got captured because you fuckers are that good? You think you captured a Veteran Ranger, outside your own territory, because you guys are that good at planning?

I'm telling you, you would have thought the same - she had maroon medical scrubs, thin-rimmed glasses and, I don't know, the kind of air about her that said she liked to cut up puppies. I don't pay her no mind and we lose her round the corner of the road.

Anyway, we come across her again a little later and she's just standing there, kinda weighing us up. I stare back with my best 'don't want no trouble' look.

She doesn't move until one of the other guards goes down and the last Legion scout's nearly dead, then she unslings that raygun and zaps him into a pile of cat litter.

I came to this frozen wasteland a decade or so ago, looking to make my way in the world. I met a beautiful woman, Saffir, who is now my wife. We have a little girl who is a little on the rough side, but nothing we can't handle.

Unfortunately, Skyrim is horrible. It's full of thieves, liars, and assassins, some of which I've had too close contact with recently. They made off with my family sword, a handcrafted steel blade from generations past. I wanted to go off and reclaim it myself, but my wife, being the nagging shrew she had become, threatened me with leaving if I went.

My angel came in the form of an Leather-clad Bosmer. She seemed likable enough, gruff, but good-hearted. She approached me and she made small talk, when she mentioned my little argument with Saffir.

""*My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword. He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.*""

""*I could help you, if you'd like.*""

I was dumbfounded. This complete stranger had just met me, and she had already offered to put her life on the line for a weapon I had lost.

I didn't have it in me to beg or plead, so I told her where it could be found and told her I'd be grateful if she came across it. She left a few hours later, and was only seen from time to time in town, stopping in Belethor's shop or headed up to the keep. I figured she had forgotten all about my little request and went back to my business.

On her next visit, she came to me with none other than my family sword slung under her arm. I was so glad to see it, I taught her a few combat techniques and went on my way.

I celebrated my sword's return with a few rounds at the Huntsman before returning home. The look on my beloved's face was enough to stop me at the door.

""*Saffir, what's wrong?*""

""*You know that Bosmer woman who comes through here, the one you got all friendly with?*""

""*She just ran through here, grabbing all of our possessions and stuffing them into her pouch, eating all our food, then she crouched, slunk off to the corner, and disappeared. And I think she took my clothes.*""

I never thought that being the Jarl of Whiterun could be such a terrible fate. My pride, my will--even my afterlife in Sovngarde--have been taken from me. 

By that damn Dragonborn.

When I first met him, I was slightly disgusted. He was nothing more than a smelly, dirt-encrusted man who looked more the type to lift a sweet roll from a starving baby’s hands than a destined hero of Skyrim. Yet he slew the dragon outside the walls of Whiterun, and consumed the beast’s soul. Any doubts I had entertained in my mind after his accomplishment were cast aside once I heard the shout of the Greybeards from their perch at High Hrothgar. “Dovahkiin!”, they called. A bitter taste rose in my mouth as that ancient name came rolling across the plains like thunder. To know that that mere prisoner of a man could be Dragonborn, while I myself could not even master the use of the Thu'um.

He returned from his kill to ask my guidance. Reluctantly, I pointed him toward High Hrothgar and told him to seek the guidance of the Greybeards. He did not leave at first (or thank me, for that matter) but instead relaxed into a crouched position. I was worried he was going to pass the dragon’s soul onto my floor in a spray of fiery excrement. Instead, he began tip-toeing his way to the room behind my throne. I felt compelled to remain seated and followed his course by moving my head until he was out of my sight. 

He returned hours later, walking by me as if I did not exist. He stopped at the dinner table, picked up a goblet, and threw it at my Housecarl, Irileth. She asked him why he did that, and he responded by jumping on the table and running across it, sending food and dishes flying about the room. 

Before he exited Dragonsreach, I heard one of my children ask the Dragonborn if he was here to lick my boots. The Dragonborn socked my son right in the mouth and made a hasty exit, leaving the boy a blubbering mess (though I must admit I felt a perverse glee, as it was something I had wanted to do for a long time. That kid has problems… pain in the ass.)

I was not amused when, later that evening, I found that almost every weapon, jewel, and piece of food had been stolen from me. I had to beat the servants within an inch of their lives, as it was clearly their fault. No wonder my daughter is always complaining about the lack of good sweet rolls, damn peasants are stealing them!

I did not lay eyes on the wretch for several months after he slew the dragon. I had been secretly hoping that he had slipped on some troll dung and cart-wheeled down the side of the mountain. 

Then one day, the doors banged open and he came rushing inside in a blast of cold winter air, wearing some freakish-looking black armor. No one said a word. He remained still for a moment, then dropped about fifty bloody rags onto the floor. I do not want to know where he pulled them from... maybe that wasn't blood on them at all, come to think of it. 

Suddenly he pulled out a cruel hammer that had what looked like a glowing red eye set inside its spiked surface. The Dragonborn let out a battle cry and began beating on Irileth. This angered me, so I rose from my casual, world-weary posture upon my throne, full of Nordic wrath. I struck him repeatedly, but to no avail. Irileth, though bloody and broken and in a posture of complete defeat… would not die. 

I had little time to reflect on this oddity before my skull was cracked wide by his mighty hammer and I felt my stamina draining. I fell to my knees, trying to ward him off with my hands as I felt warm blood cascading down the side of my face, yet he continued to rain blows down upon me. I felt my spine crack, my arms shattered like rotten kindling, but I would not die. The assault continued for several minutes until I heard a drum roll, though I knew not where it came from. Upon hearing this, the Dragonborn put his hammer away and made to leave. He stopped at the stairs and turned around, a spark of spiteful glee in his eyes. He opened his mouth and drew in a large breath, and before I knew what was happening, a great shout poured forth from him, and the contents of my dinner table where once again strewn about my keep. He chuckled and finally left.

He began to make regular appearances after that, showing up just to smack us around with his weapons until that drum roll happened. Sometimes he would wail away at us until there were several drum rolls. Yet we never died. We were injured, we felt great pain, we bled… but no, we would not die. 

I snuck away one night to see if I was really immortal. Irileth found me a week later, a noose around my neck and hanging from a shaft in one of the farmer’s barns outside of Whiterun. Many times I had tried to get the attention of one of those dirt farmers out on the road, but it’s kind of hard to talk when you’re constantly gagging. But at least I knew the truth. I could not die. I prayed to the Nine to make this not so, but my pleas either went unheard or the Nine simply did not care.

If I had been told when I was a child that I was immortal, I would have been thrilled. Who doesn’t want to live forever? But the reality is much harsher, and not something one should wish for. To suffer the many beatings that I have, to have my body and my desire to live broken again and again. To watch my own children be engulfed in flames, screaming and crying as their flesh sizzles, only to be fine again in a few seconds, and then have the torture unleashed upon them once again. 

And all while the Dragonborn laughs, and taunts, and waits for those drum rolls. We have been thrashed, burned, frozen, pick-pocketed, Shouted at. Dremora have been summoned to abuse us. All for the sake of some drum rolls. I still do not know their significance, though they clearly have some importance to the Dragonborn.

I fine him every time, but he must be made of gold for he gives it up without hesitation. I throw him in jail, and he either escapes or just fights his way out and flees the city. Sometimes he serves his sentence.

Sometimes.

Yet I feel there is hope. As I stood looking out over the vast plains of Whiterun this morning, watching the fearsome Giants herd their mammoths (such majestic creatures), I received word that the Dragonborn had departed Skyrim to seek out adventure on the island of Solstheim.

Good. Let the Dunmer deal with him… though Alduin and his kin still ravage the land of Skyrim. Damn Dragonborn didn’t even do his job.

If only there were another Dragonborn to take his place…

Update:

The bastard came back riding on a dragon. He used the foul creature to burn down Whiterun. We had just gotten everything back to normal after the damage the Civil War had caused! 

Every citizen of Whiterun is dead except for a few of us (at least I am not alone in my misery). I send hordes and hordes of guards after the Dragonborn (where in Oblivion do they keep coming from?) and he shrugs them away like nothing. I give up.

Curse the Nine! Curse the daedra lords!

And above all, CURSE THE DRAGONBORN!

I was born (fully grown) fifteen minutes ago in the town center, entering the world with a vigorous ""shee-hoh!"", full of hopes and dreams and dressed in nought but a pair of tight blue shorts. But I had no idea whatsoever what was going on around me, so I just stood around for a while. Occasionally the local barracks would spew out legionnaires. I had no idea where they came from - I never saw anyone enter the building. I thought they had a tunnel somewhere in there, or something. 

So yeah, anyways. I just stood next to the town center for a while, pondering this brave new world while some other guys in tight blue shorts chopping away at the local forests like a horde of Brazilians ran past me depositing their loads into the town center constantly. Others dragged large haunches of venison from berry bushes and fish ponds. Not sure what was up with that.

Then I saw it. A giant hovering thing (I have no idea how to describe it, it looked kind of like a kind of shovel with a really short handle or something, I don't even know) poked me in the belly. Startled, I blurted out a confused ""Rogan?"", but there was no answer. The thing merely dragged me by my pants into the black clouds beyond our encampment. The clouds gave way quick enough, but still, it was surreal - here I was, being dragged by a huge shovel-head through a black, dark fog mere minutes after being born. In any case, after a while we reached a fog that was a little less dark that twisted its way through the landscape (it started somewhere at our encampment, I always wondered where it led), and I saw some red buildings in the distance. 

A giant tower then floated through the sky for a while (What the fuck, right?). It then abruptly disappeared somewhere atop a cliff and was replaced by four poles and some building materials. ""Erectus?"" I asked, but again no answer came, so I just went for it and started hammering away at the ground in front of that thing. 

So yeah, I was actually alright with this, the shovel-head had stopped tugging at my pants and dragging me through the fog and I had some time to ponder these events while pounding the floor. After a while some archers even got dragged to where I was to keep me company or something. 

But my peace did not remain unbroken for long, of course. Some bearded guy in white and red robes walked up to me and started shouting ""Wololo"" at me, and the next thing I knew my pants turned red and the huge thing in the sky poked me again, with a sword this time, and all of a sudden those archers were using me and the bearded guy for target practice. 

Oh, I ran, of course, but one of their (perfectly synchronized -- those guys were professionals, word) volleys hit me and here I am, ten arrows in my gut, lying in a puddle of my own blood writing my last words.

Our newest arrival barely escaped with his life, but we have no clue how long he's been traveling. Lost count of the days, he's said.

*I don't get it. One of those things came out from the desert, but we still live. Actually... Things are amazing! He went into one of the small shacks left empty after the last raid, and we'd not seen much of him. But now there's a metal door on that shack, and a wall around our village. And new houses. And lights. The priest said he saw the creature building some manner of automaton. Massive hulking things of iron. There are more crops now. Could this be happening? What manner of magic does this being command? Are we really saved, or will our fate be much worse than I feared?*

He was a God damn animal.
Some bandits have been trying to start shit cause we've been hiding this guy named Ringo, so we gave the courier a gun and hired him to take care of them. Good for them if they want to risk their necks for Ringo, but I'll have no part of it. I don't fuck with bandits, and I don't feel like that's an unreasonable principle. I'm pretty sure I have a fatal allergy to getting shot.
Anyways, a little later I see him talk over to the gas station where Ringo's hiding. Then gunshots.

What the fuck. Of course I don't want this shit, but I buy it anyways because I'm about to pee myself.
Next thing I know, everything is exploding. The courier used dynamite (also given to him to fight the bandits) to kill everyone in the town. The bandits pay him some caps and take over the town. He strips everyone I know, all the friends I've lived with for years and years, Doc Mitchell, Easy Pete, Sunny Smiles, Trudy, Victor, he strips them down and sells me all their things. Most of their things still have gooey pieces of themselves on them, because of the dynamite. He sells me a gun with an entire hand still holding it, finger on the trigger. I begin to cry as I hand him the caps. I can't help it. 
And he doesn't even blink. His eyes were empty and black like the eyes of a doll or the dead. He finally leaves. Even if I have to spend the rest of my life running a shop for bandits, at least I'll never have to see that son of a bitch ever again.
And just as that thought crosses my mind, I glance out the window and see his silhouette freeze in the horizon, and slows turn back.

He begins to load his shot gun.
Oh no no no no fuck.
He walks into the saloon.
Wait what?
He starts killing all the bandits.

It's Vegas, 'course there's crazy shit, but for some reason, working as dealer in a casino like the Tops seems to earn you front-row tickets for the special kind of zany whatthefuckery that seems to be attracted to this town. 

Take for example, the woman who walks through the doors a few months ago. This crazy broad's wearing nothing but a pair of shades, a beret that looks like she lifted it off one of 'em NCR sharpshooters, and fucking leopard-print pajamas. Looked like she just fucking came outta Gomorrah, she did. 

Course, bein' a dealer and all, I gotta respect the clientele, so I play it cool, avert my eyes, etc. regardless of whether they're a drunk or the biggest kook this side of the Sierra Nevada. Just my luck then that she jogs over to my table lookin' to play some blackjack.

Without a word, she plunks down the max, 200 chips. Start dealin' cards, and whaddya fucking know, the cards lookin' up at me are an ace and a ten.

Now, it ain't exactly *unheard* of to get a hand like that. Lucky as fuck, but not impossible. What *is* unheard of is what happened next. This lady, bettin' at max, goes on to win *9 outta fuckin' 10* hands dealt to her, all the way till she'd made somethin' like 10,000 chips, only stopping for the amount of time it took to get to the cashier, pick up her ""prize"", and beeline right on back. 

'Course, right as this bimbo's making bank off us, the floor manager steps in and tells her she ""can no longer patronize our gambling services"". Soon as the words are outta his mouth, she's hoppin' like a fucking jackrabbit out the door. Ain't never seen her again, but word on the street is that she's the one been in an' out of the Lucky 38.

Now *that* is some fucking luck.

In the twenty years I've been chief, not a single thing has come out of that desert that wasn't about to blow me up or eat me. So I see something moving out there and I get everybody up in their houses. We are battening down the hatches as he gets closer and all of a sudden I realize that this one is different. He's human, or something close. He's certainly not like us. How can he even smell with a nose that small?

We send Frank out to see what he wants. Frank comes back with a handful of emeralds and no clothes. ""He wanted armor"", he says.

So every now and again this guy comes out of the desert to trade. I send a few guys to see what this guy is doing out there. They come back with stories about a house that gets bigger and bigger, about strange clanking and clicking that comes up out of the ground. I decide it's best to leave him alone.

But then it happens. This guy comes in one day stacked in steel and looking to trade. And it just so happens that he runs into Ed, the stingiest asshole in town. Well, obviously Ed tries to scam the dude, and he gets angry. And suddenly this stranger stabs Ed through the goddamn chest! Out of fucking nowhere!

Well, we're all too stunned and scared to do anything, so we're just standing there frozen until he leaves. But after that, we're pissed. We have rules around here, and he broke them. He kills a man, we get his Xp.

We suit up. Sure, he's armored to hell, but enough of us swarming him could work, right?

We get to his house in the desert after about half a day, plenty of time to kill him and get back before the spiders get antsy. His house is *huge*. I had no idea something that big could be built on sand. And sure enough, there's this clacking and ticking from under our feet. I don't know what it is, but it sounds nasty. We go in through the front door.

Halfway down the hall way things go bad. Fred trips the wire going in first. The whole goddamn floor opens up and he falls in. It's not too deep, he isn't hurt by the fall, but then the floor closes again. *On his head*.

Well, by now we're all screaming, and suddenly we realize just how long the hallway is to the door. Bill gets there first, just in time to look up at the lava coming down. Me and Ted back away, but we can't escape Bill's scream. We go tearing off down a side corridor.

Ted's gone. I don't know where we got split off, but i thought i heard him scream. Me, I ran into a room full of zombies with some sort of cage in the middle. Running as fast as I can, I see some kind of purple light. Well, it can't be worse than where I am now.

I'm in hell. It couldn't possibly be anywhere else. The heat rises up from the lava, the air so thick I can barely breathe. What's that? Some kind of ungodly chirping. I can see something white...

I knew the only things that came out of the desert would eat me or blow me up. I guess the stranger was no different.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_19xm1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/19xm1o/minecraft_the_stranger/,

I'm Stenvar. I ain't usually one for words, but I found this empty journal in some gods forsaken cave last Tirdas. Once the ale supplies have run low and the roasted goats leg has been picked clean there ain't usually much else to do of an evening 'sides watchin the skies or sleepin. I ain't overly attached to either, so I been practicing writing my words. 

She's watchin me now from her bedroll on the other side of the fire, thinks I can't see her through the flames. Curious as ever; that same look in her eyes she gets whenever we're debating whether or not to explore this cave or that redoubt. She's dying to ask *'what's with the book, Sten?'* But she won't. And she ain't nearly as good at pickpocketing as she thinks she is, so she ain't gettin her hands on it, save for prying it from my cold dead fingers. Which is always a possibility in this occupation, but at which time I won't care either way. So I'll keep on writing.

She walks into Candlehearth Hall one night, battered and bleeding, sits down at the bar and orders a bottle of Argonian Bloodwine. (And a sweetroll. The girl ain't ever met a sweetroll she couldn't find room for.) I'll never forget it. She downs the whole bottle right there at the bar. The *whole* bottle. That stuff'll burn the tattoos of'n a Forsworn, and there's this girl - this little slip of a thing in scaled armour that just about drowns her - drinking the stuff like it's Mammoth milk. I been sittin around in that tavern for more'n two years, and ain't nothin made me sit up in my chair like the sight of that girl downing Argonian Bloodwine like she ought to be sporting scales and a tail herself. She follows it up with two bottles of Nord Ale (but already I can tell she ain't no Nord) and then sits back, eyes closed. And I think she's passed out, like she's gonna take a header off of that bar stool any second, but instead she opens her eyes and turns to look at me. And suddenly it's me that's like to be takin that header. Reckon I'm still fallin, if I speak the truth. 

**14th of Evening Star**

I been toutin for business in Candlehearth a long time. I came here looking for them that done for my wife, and since I ain't found them (though I got me a damn good idea who they are) I just stayed on. Where else was I gonna go? Without Ivela I didn't have no place to go home to. I told her Windhelm weren't no town for a Dunmer but she never was one for being afraid of much and she went off trading her wares anyhow. Always thinkin the best of people, that one. You think like that, you just attract the worst of them. They can smell it on you, like a horse can smell fear. As like to break bread with the Khajeet as with the the Nords that slit her throat on that trading galley from Solstheim, Ivela would give anyone a chance to see that pretty smile. 

Gods but I miss her still. 

But Ivela's been gone a long time, and I've been working out of Windhelm a long time, and I ain't never come across nobody quite like this girl. I've sold my sword wherever there was coin in the selling of it. Words are wind, and loyalty is golden; these are things a sellsword tells himself to aid his wine in the bringing of sleep. I ain't never had much cause for a cause, if you take my meaning. And then she comes along. This Imperial foundling. Angry, for certain. Frightened, at least in the beginning. Powerful, but without discipline, out of control. Like me she don't come from anywhere in particular, but she made herself some friends in Ivarstead, and then - as she tells it - happ'n she got these friends killed. She'd contented herself hunting game, rustling up her potions wherever she could find the equipment, travelling here and there to trade her wares. Then they called her, the Greybeards, blast their eyes. 'You're the Dragonborn,' they tell her, casual as you please. 'You're the chosen one.' As if that weren't enough, some lunatic over in Morrowind takes issue with this, sends his grunts over to sort things out. They failed, but in the failing they took her friends, they died protecting her. And now she's angry. Real angry. In shame and grief she fled Ivarstead and come to Windhelm, following the only clue she could find on the bodies of the slain crazies. And that's where I found her. Half mad with wanting revenge, and not a battle skill worth a horker's fart. 

I talked her out of getting on the boat straight over to Solstheim and getting herself killed, like as not. Took some doing mind; that one's as apt to listen to reason as Ivela ever was, which is to say not apt at all. I told her that if she had the coin, I could maybe teach her a thing or two. Get that armour sorted out, maybe even find a weapon worth a damn. Take on some work around Windhelm, practice those shaky skills, maybe eat a few more sweetrolls so she don't get knocked over by every strong wind that come barrelling down through the Grey Quarter. Make some coin. Sweet mother of Talos, that girl knows how to make coin. Got every trader in the Hold wrapped around her finger wanting more of this potion or that; we ain't never gone hungry a single day. And always coin enough left over to slip to the ragged folk. 

It's been months, and damn if that girl hasn't surprised me at every turn. She's stronger, faster, more powerful than any warrior I ever known. From this frightened, shy, serious kid she's turned into a fearless, bawdy, deadly adventuress in hardly a world's full turn. I ain’t never laughed so hard, run so fast, nor fought to well as I have with her at my side.

**10th of Morning Star**

She don't know, but I seen the way she looks at Quintus, that Imperial snowback over in the White Phial. And I seen the way he looks right back, when I'm standin right there and they're making jokes about harvesting giant's toe cheese, or waxing lyrical on the healing properties of wheat. Ain't no way I can compete with that. Respectable businessman, alchemist, kinsman... snow-berried milk-drinker. Looks like he ain't barely seen daylight, never mind battle. He'll provide for her, no doubt. But he wouldn't put himself between her and a blood dragon. He wouldn't call off the attention of a snow troll while she sneaks up and sets it afire or distract a giant while she steals his hoard.

But Quintus or not, someday soon she'll have learned everything she can from me. I seen it in her face. She’ll slip away one night and she'll be on that trading ship to Morrowind, chasing her revenge. There won't be a damn thing Quintus can do about it, and she sure as Oblivion won’t listen to what I got to say on the matter. Truth is I ain't got no way left to impress that girl, save for hittin things real hard till they don't get up, and that's business as usual these days. I still crack wise about her givin me more coin every time she asks if I'll carry a little extra, but you know what? I don't want coin no more. I don't want nothin no more.

I just want the girl. ",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_16c2bs,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/16c2bs/skyrim_sellswords_lament/,

I would love to go out and adventure, its always been my dream to be a hero, and even now I always daydream about the epic battles I could be experiencing. Its just that between room and board, and paying for my... accidents, I couldn't even afford a cheap set of armor from Alvor.

Something changed all that recently. One day these two stormcloaks come running into town. At least I think they were both stormcloaks, one of them was a Breton wearing bloody legion leather and a mage hood. Apparently the proper soldier was a relative of Gerdur, they sat by the mill talking while the strange soldier ran around picking flowers, odd but I have heard the local flowers do have quite a few alchemical properties. Eventually they part ways, Gerdur's relative who I found out was named Ralof stayed for a few days before heading back to Windhelm, his companion left town towards Whiterun a few days beforehand though.

For a few weeks after that I thought things were going back to the same old bore, when one day the stranger comes back to town. I'm sure it was him since not many Bretons wear war paint like that. The strangest part was how he acted. He came up to me and started talking like we were best friends, but I have to admit I did get along with him well, he actually listened to my stories of battles I've run though my head dozens of times, though he did seem a bit expressionless at times.Then what seems like out of nowhere he wants me to follow him on his  adventures! I hardly hesitate because I will finally get a chance to live my dream.

He says he wants to trade some things so I jokingly say ""Think of me like a two legged pack mule, with a bit more charm"", even though he hands me a full set a reinforced leather and fur armor to change into along with steel warhammer, it wasn't long before I regretted those words.

I finally found out how strange this fellow truly was. First of all he runs EVERYWHERE. I try my best to keep up but even when I fall behind I find him waiting just up the road, only, he waits right in the middle with his back turned to me and as soon as I near he continues on.

We make our way towards a bandit hideout near Bleak Falls barrow, FINALLY I will got to experience some real combat, but it wasn't as glorious as I was expecting. Before the bandit can finish spouting off their warning he blasts them with lightning. This draws the attention of the others which come out of the tower. He dons a shield and fends their attacks while drawing them towards me. I worked up all the courage I could an swung at the nearest bandit, my hammer connected with the back of their skull in a sickening crunch. I had never swung at a real live person before let alone killed anyone! In a sad way though I got used to it fast, as every single fight we got into turned this way, him drawing their attention and me caving in the back of their skull, whether man, mer, beast or undead, every battle ended this way.

Then there was the aftermath of every fight. He would go around from corpse to corpse collecting EVERY SINGLE POSSESSION. Now, who do you think ended up lugging around all of this? But it wasn't just the spoils of battle he took, as we made our way into the barrow it seems like he took anything of value that wasn't nailed down.

It was hard enough chasing after him in just MY armor, now I try my hardest to jog after him carrying the supplies of half a dozen bandits. Come to think of it, I'm not even sure all of these people are bandits. Sure they dress like a brigand, but so does he! He fires off his lightning as soon as we are in sight of the next opponent, usually before they even have a chance to notice us.

I directed him over to Legate Rikke.

She sends him to clear out Fort Hraggstad. Months go by, he doesn't show up. Then, out of the clear blue sky, he comes and asks me to go  to a peace summit at the Throat of the World. I agree to go and end up making a hesitant peace with Ulfric until Alduin has been delt with. I try to speak with him about the Fort after the summit, but he runs off.

So, I hear he kills Alduin and still nothing. Almost a YEAR after Legate Rikke assigns it to him, he finally says the deed is done. Ww then win the war in under a week.

We were all gettin' real tired and impatient, and just when we were considering goin' back in, Joe says he saw something off in the distance, so he goes to ~~investigait~~ investigate. Probably too much jet, or sumthin'. Does jet make you see shit? Can't remember.

So anyway, after a while Joe doesn't come back. Hammer says we should go find him, and after a bit of moanin' and groanin' we go off to find Joe. So we walk for a while, and then we find what looks like Joe's left (or was it right? I forget sometimes.) arm lyin' there by a big old rock. Hammer just about jumped outta his fuckin' skin when we found it. Always was a wimp. So we follow this long trail of blood splatters, and we find the rest of Joe. Shit, what a *mess!*

His head was in pieces (I stepped in a piece of his brain), one of his legs was in pieces, and there was a huge burn on his shoulder, as if he'd been lazered or sumthin'. So, I said we should run back, but Knife just laughs and tells me not to be a coward, and that we should stay here, find who killed Joe and get a little revenge.

So we wait for a couple minutes by the big rock, when outta nowhere Gunny's head just fuckin' explodes. I probably wouldn'ta noticed, if his eyeball hadn't ended up in my goddamm hair. Whoever was doin' this, he musta been using one of those silenced guns. Probably a snipper rifle, at that kinda range. So I poke my head out over the rock, and I swear to god, I saw these glowin' red eyes over the hill, like we're being shot by a fucking deemon or somethin'. Then this laser beam comes outta nowhere and hits Sledge's rifle, sendin' it flying way back. He swears under his breth and goes to get it back (idiot), and before we know it his arm is gone and he's lying in a puddle of blood. Knife grabs me and Hammer by the shoulder and counts to 3, then we jump out from behind the rock and charge forward. Knife hid behind another rock, Hammer took cuvver behind a cactus and I hauled my ass behind another big old rock. 

Then I see the eyes again, glowin' red like a fire, coming towards us. Then I manage to get a glimpse of this asshole in all his ""glory"". He was holding one of those fancy NCR revolvers with the red handle, and he was wearing one of those black coats the big NCR badasses have, only different. It looked stronger and tougher, and it had these big green shoulder padds and pouches and shit. Then we see this floatin' robot tagging along with him. Musta been the one shooting the lazers. The red-eyed guy raises his hand, and the robot beeps and stops. Then he comes round the rock Hammer was hiding behind, and just blows his fuckin' head off. Knife runs out screaming and shoots him a cupple times, but the red-eyed guy just ignores him and blows both his arms off. Never seen anyone shoot that fast.

Then he came for me.

He just stood there, starin' down at me with those demon eyes, as if he was waiting for me to make a move. I got up slowly and spat on his helmet. I grabbed my mashete, but before I could swing he just grabbed it out of my hand, held it up in the air, shot the blayd, and threw it away. That was my favorite, too. I reeched for my 10mm, but he grabbed it and put it in his coat. He told me to put my hands up, so I did. He put his revolver back under his coat, and got a small black one with a short barrel. I managed to get a glimps of other stuff under his coat, and *man,* this guy *loved* his revolvers. He had a .44 with a pearl handle, his Sequoa, and this real fancy one with a club on the handle. He had one of those 12.7 pistols too, with a black handle and a shorter barell. So he points his little black revolver at my leg, and he says ""Go tell Motor-Runner I'm coming for him. I don't care how many people you have in that hole of yours, I'll kill them all. If I got rid of Cook Cook I can get rid of you all.""

Then before I got a chance to run for it, the fucker shoots me in the leg. I sat on the ground for a while, grindin' my teeth and holding my leg. When I got up again, the deemon was gone. I limped my way back to Vault 3 and gave Motor-Runner the message. Cocky bastard just laughed it off. But not even Motor could take that guy. He had at least *six* guns, and I think I saw one of those old Pre-War Japanees sords on his back. And that armur? Knife shot him and he just *ignored* it.

He gives him the option to pay for what he stole and then take the item from him only to keep it for himself. Next offer he gives him is to go to jail and still give the item that he stole to the guards. But before he can give him his final choice he says he would rather die than turn himself in. So my fellow guard says ""Then pay with your blood."" In under two seconds the man has killed everyone in the town but me. So I charge him in hopes of stopping him.

I decided to spend that morning taking care of some business in the market place.  You see my wife needed me to pick up some leeches for our sick daughter and I needed to grab some money from the local bank.  As I approached the bank I saw that it had newly been renovated, looking less like a shack and more like a legitimate place of business.  Apparently a man had bought the place as well as every other shop in the town.  Surprised but thinking nothing of it I continued on my way to get the leeches.  Next then I know, WHAM, a man crashes into the wagon of straw next to me.  Alarmed and worried he was hurt I pause to check on him.  Next thing I know the man leaps out of the straw, whilst shoving me to the ground.  After seeing him run off I pick myself up and dust off my shirt.  After acquiring the leeches I begin my journey home.  Stopping briefly I sit on a bench to cool myself in the shade.  Suddenly out of the blue I see the same rude guy sprinting toward me.  He shoved a poor woman to the side as he neared my bench.  I sat there frozen in fear as he threw himself next to me.  I tried not to breathe as I stared straight ahead, my eyes fixed on the pavement in front of me.  After a few moments he calmly stands up and walks over the the wall across from me.  Beginning to scale the wall he leaps up and over the edge.  My last sight of him was his back as he left from rooftop to rooftop.  It was without a doubt the scariest day of my life.  I live in fear now of every bench and wagon left on the street.  I've had friends who tell me that they've had run in with the man too.  He shoves his way into groups of people, stopping any conversation that had previously been having.  I hope someone stops this man soon, every time I put of wanted posters they've been torn down in a matter of minutes.

I grew up as a farm boy in Rorikstead where my father owned an inn. Growing up I always loved to hear stories of adventurers and heroes and always dreamed of being one. Well one day, about a year and a half ago this High Elf walks into town and runs straight up to me. I thought for sure he was a Thalmor agent come to arrest me for Talos worship or some other nonsense. Then instead, he just starts talking to me like we're old friends, even gets me to open up about my frustratingly controlling father. Afterwords he even agrees to help! He runs off to the inn and when I get back that night my dad hands me a pouch of eight hundred something gold and tells me to go buy some armor and weapons form Whiterun. A few days later I adopt the title of ""Slayer"" and start hiring myself out as a mercenary. Unfortunately there weren't many buyers in Rorikstead and just when I'm about to head to Solitude the Elf shows up again. I thank him for the money that I know he left and he agrees to hire me for five hundred gold!

A few days later we're up in Winterhold and heading west out of the town into the frozen north-lands. I'm sure I'm about to freeze to death and to be honest I was starting to doubt this guy. He'd hardly spoken a word to me since we left and has only told me that we're going to some ruin. After we left Winterhold it didn't take us more than a day to find it. A massive Dwemmer ruin embedded in the side of a glacier! It was amazing. We fought side by side killing old Dwemmer constructs and what felt like a small army of those Falmer things. It was so incredible I didn't even mind that he made me carry everything. 

Eventually we got to what I thought was the bottom where we fought some massive golem (I think he called it a Centurion?) and these two other adventurers who were down there. Just when I thought our delve into this ruin was over he walks over to this odd, square table like thing and pulls out a tiny sphere which he inserts into the machine. To my surprise a hidden stairway appears and we descend even further into the crust of the earth. We come out into this unbelievably huge cavern. It was too beautiful to describe. Giant glowing mushroom, geodes of precious ore, and this giant steel ball of glowing light that lit most of the cavern. We fought our way through an army of Falmer and their bizarre insect creatures. Eventually we make it into a big tower and ride a moving platform to it's peak (Unbelievable what the Dwarves could build sometimes) At the top there was this big mechanism that he worked artfully, as though he'd done it a dozen times before and low and behold within the machine was an *Elder Scroll*! Most people go their whole lives without ever seeing even a glimpse one! Finally we head back to the surface, one of the greatest treasures in all of Tamriel in our hands. 

I was hoping to go somewhere warmer or to a tavern to rest and relax for a bit nut instead he takes us *even farther north*. I swear we went so far north that if we'd gone five feet more we'd have wound up in Atmora! Anyways, we come to this tiny little cave and he tells me to wait outside. A bit later he comes back out and tells me to follow him. Over the next few weeks we traveled all over Skyrim doing this and that, clearing out bandit hide outs and such but not much more. One day we even attacked a patrol of Thalmor agents! Eventually we headed back up north to that small cave. This time when he came out he was carrying a bizarre and unsettling book. He takes me to his home in the south of Skyrim, a huge manor near Falkreath, and spends hours reading the book then putting it on the shelf, taking it off, reading it, then putting it on the shelf, over and over again. Eventually he stops and looks at me. I could tell something was different behind to pale, war-painted eyes. Things weren't the same after that. He was suddenly **much** more powerful and the situations we got in were just too much for me. Eventually he told me it was time for us to part ways and to be honest I wasn't entirely disappointed. Sure the adventures were fun but being his glorified pack mule wasn't what I'd had in mind.

It's been nearly a year since then. The war is over but things aren't much better. I know I've seen dragons flying around and vampires keep attacking the village. I fight them off nearly every other night. At least the Name ""Eric the Slayer"" is starting to catch on, heh. I've even heard rumors that the Dragonborn, *The Dragonborn* has returned to Skyrim. Rumors say he's an elf in ebony armor who travels with a pale young woman. Some how I know it's the same guy, that same elf.

Today was one of those days that you realise the actual absurdity of this plane we live on. Honestly, sometimes I think Sheogorath's touch reaches out in ways we can hardly fathom!

I had been hiding out in the Rift ambushing travelers after having to bolt from Whiterun after an 'unfortunate' incident in the Bannered Mare. The war and the return of the dragons had been good for business. Plenty of displaced farmers and a few lightly guarded noblemen were lightened of their burdensome coin purses.

Today though I thought my ship had arrived. A 'dapper' fellow arrived on MY road, naturally he would pay the tax for the privilege. I hid in the underbrush waiting for him to get closer.

As he got closer I discerned he was a dunmer. A slight fellow, decked to the hilt in finery. I had to stifle a snort so as to not give myself away. Here was this chap, wearing the finest clothes and boots money could buy, golden jewelry shimmering with rare gems, a goddamned jeweled circlet on his head, running around, unguarded, picking flowers and catching butterflies with not a care in the world! 

He was even wearing gloves so his fingers would stay clean, the milk drinker! I saw the bulge of his coin purse as he got close and it caused a similar bulge in my armour! I made my move and from there onward my memory seems confused.

He must have been an apostle of Dibella or a master of the bards college or something because he somehow persuaded me to leave him on his way. As I turn to let him pass I am staggered by a firebolt to the back.

Two or three more of these hit me and I crumple to the ground. I yield to him, hoping to bide time to a run the dagger in my boot through his throat, but he walks closer saying nothing.

My blood is pumping, this is the moment I die, I don't want to die here with some peasant 'treasures' and 'noble' signet rings, worth more for pride than value! If I could only find the strength to rise, even for a moment I could run him through. But here he is. He raised his hands and I see his mana flow into form. I saw what I thought was the birth of my death and it was horrifying.

Before he blasted me my whole being clenched tight, hoping to resit destruction, but when the spell hit, all I felt was serenity. I was at peace. I no longer thought I needed my dagger, I thought, why did I ever need a dagger? I looked up, smiling and in pure bliss to thank him.

He was gone. I was still weak but felt content to lie on the road for a while. Then my senses returned. I drank some potions to recover some health and decided to get the hell out of the Rift as soon as I could.

I thought I saw some weird things done by the forsworn in the Reach but  maybe it's just a 'Skyrim' thing. I think I should just move back to the Imperial City. Might not be as much business being sacked but at least I won't have to deal with anymore bears.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1amrb8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1amrb8/skyrim_the_thief_and_the_dandy/,

So, a few years back I married this tough looking man. We choose to settle down in this huge city named Whiterun. My father works there as a steward too, so the choice seemed pretty obvious. At first everyone seemed all nice and dandy except for this one redguard always being picky and arrogant... He'll get his someday, I hope. 
Anyways my husband and I decided to open up a shop. 
Nothing fancy, just everyday armor and gear. 

A few months later everything is still going pretty fine. Well, there was this odd day last week. Some stranger passed by, wearing a shiny steel helmet and a robe. Odd choice of clothing but nevermind. The first thing he does upon arrival in the town is to head towards my shop. ""Sweet, this guy looks wealthy"" I think to myself as he looks like a potential costumer. 

Oh, but I was wrong. I have never in my entire life met such a douchebag. My forge, tanning rack etc. stands outside free to use. It's not like I expect people to actually use it, but I have it there as a gesture. Case is, this guy starts using the forge without even saying hi. He keeps staring intense into the blazing fire without blinking a single time. He stands there for several hours, working. As I wonder what he's making, I try to contact him. Nothing seems to work. I then head home, still wondering who the man were and what his purpose with the forge was.

I returned to the shop next day only to find him waiting for me. ""Had that guy been up all night standing outside waiting for me?"" I think to myself. Then, out of damn nowhere he pulls out 93 iron daggers. Who the hell uses iron daggers for anything?! This is when I start getting really angry since my dad is already blaming me for not returning his rusty old sword. That's another story though.

Back to the stranger. As I approach him he starts asking me if he can sell the stuff to me. Seriously... Do I look like a woman who is in need of 93 iron daggers? Well I had to buy it anyways. Upon that I start calculating and asks him for the money. But no.. 

The guy insists that I buy them from him ONE PIECE AT A TIME. What is this, a joke?! As I try to hold in my anger he starts handing the daggers over. One at a time... About twenty-thirty daggers in, the sound of a sudden drumroll appears. The stranger just keeps staring into the air like he doesn't even care. 
This random act repeats for several days. Sometimes he's waiting for me to arrive in the morning, sometimes he's there in the evening with more ores for him to smelt. 

One day, he's not there. No drumrolls anymore, no money to save up for bargaining with him, no iron daggers and no odd staring. I felt relieved. A few days later I heard about some one finally re-discovering the arts of dragon smithing.. At least it's not Eorlund Greymane.

We were told she was wandering the woods south of Riften. We've been on her trail for days when we finally found that damn cat at some Nord ruin, Lost Tongue Overlook, I think. We heard some commotion atop the mountain as we made our way through the sticks, and lo and behold, a fucking dragon skeleton comes barreling down the cliffside, crashing down in a cloud of dust, nearly crushing Hrothi. By the Nine...

We all trade terrified glances, but we all know what the Black-Briars would do if the job didn't get finished, so the three of us ascend the stairs of the place. About 10 steps from the top, out pokes a small Khajiit in leather armor. ""We're here to teach you a lesson."" I blurt out, realizing that that cat was her. In response, she yells something I didn't catch, and some wave of magic flew from that word, nearly making me lose my footing on the stairs. When we regained our balance, we just rushed her. Worst decision of my life.

She spent about 5 minutes jumping around, taking pot shots at us with her pitiful bow. If any of us managed to land a blow, she simply reached into a pouch on her hip, and chugged the contents of a red bottle, tossing it on the ground after it was emptied. She filled Hrothi and Gertrude with arrows, I regret having to tell their families about what happened. 

Me? The bitch ran up to me, having been exhausted after running back and fourth in steel armor and having an arrow lodge itself below my kneecap.

I watched her walk the streets every day from my window, with her flower baskets and her trinkets to sell. I suffered without complaint the raps on my knuckles from my tutor for not paying attention, because *I loved her.*  

By the Gods, she was beautiful.  

My heart stopped the moment she first took my hand, and only started again at the first touch of her lips to mine. I thought then that I would die, that my very heart would explode with happiness, but I cared not. For she was mine from that day.  

I loved her.  

I loved her deeper still when she placed my hand on her swollen belly and opened her bright green eyes wide, graced me with that smile.
I did not know how I would escape my betrothal – sealed since birth – to the high-born daughter of a miserly wizard, but there beneath the blossoming trees it mattered not; I would find a way. For we were a family from that day.  

I loved them both.  

Yet my son never came to see the sun. He never came to know her face, *that smile*, or to love the light in those green eyes as I did. They took my son. They took my love.  

An arakh to open the gut, I was told by a well-meaning witness who thought I would want to know. An arakh to open the gut, and a scimitar through the heart.  

They took my family.   

*He* took my family. And for the disrespect and shame I bestowed upon him, two gifts he would bestow upon my head in return. Firstly his daughter, my betrothed, for less than half the agreed dowry. My father’s rage at losing such riches over my ‘careless indiscretion’ would force me from my home and out of Hammerfell forever. Secondly, and in secret, the wizard bequeathed his curse upon my name, my life and my very lips.  

‘For the infamy you have brought upon my family and upon your own, never again in your life shall you earn the respect of another. Your words will betray you at every turn, and you shall live in scorn, resentment and detestation for all of your days.’  

So it is, and so shall it be.  

I left Hammerfell a rich young man with a bride from a family of renown. We travelled north and east, to Skyrim and to Wintersand Manor, which was to be my sole inheritance from my father.  

Upon our arrival, the manor lay in smoking ruins. ‘Magical anomalies’, claimed the portly Whiterun guard who had been dispatched to investigate the flames.  
‘A parting gift from my father,’ posited my young bride, and I knew only too well she spoke the truth.  

So we travelled on towards Whiterun and to the sole farm under the estate of Wintersand. There we encountered Wilmuth, my father’s Nord manservant, toiling in the frozen loam. His own wife had died not two winters past, and as he spoke of her he pointed to the unmarked grave by the old windmill. Together they had turned that same soil for more than fifty years. They had no children. The look in his eyes when he spoke of his loss broke my very heart. 

My wife demanded he be turned from the house so that we might take up residence, but Wilmuth begged to be allowed to end his days in the same straw bed as his beloved wife. Knowing that my curse would not allow me to speak to him but cruelly, I did not speak to him at all. I simply shook his hand and escorted my protesting wife through the city gates and up the steps to the nearest inn.  

Here we remain, paying guests at the Drunken Huntsman. Wilmuth’s endless toils ensure that the farm earns a modest living, and I have enough gold put by to see that we do not have to live in poverty. My wife has taken up work at the temple, employing her natural magical skills as a healer. Ahlam is not fond of me, and knows not the reason for my inability to speak kindness to her. Or to anyone. Not to kind, hardworking Ysolda, not to my jovial host Anoriath, and not even to the strangers who on occasion grace the beautiful streets of Whiterun.  

Once, overhearing rumours of an attack on Dragonsreach, I wrote anonymously to the Jarl conveying a warning. I understand that the letter saved lives, which was a wonderful gift. A gift that has since been twisted by my curse into arrogance and endless bragging. I have no interest in the Jarl or in visiting the Cloud District, yet I cannot close my mouth against the tide of detestable nonsense that it spills each day.

Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with this, but the Infinity had just been dragged through a gravity well, and we were under attack! I counted at least 8 covenant cruisers, and he sends us down to do a recon?! 

But it gets worse. Lasky, our First Officer, is coming with us. We're in the middle of the largest clusterfuck since the squid-heads torched half of Africa, and Lasky decides to be the next Captain Kirk. Does't even wear armour. 

We hit the dirt, and almost immediately everything trails off into an eerie quiet. This jungle, it's too dead. There's nothing but plants. The only thing I can hear is the footsteps of my teammates and the somewhat louder footfalls of the spartans he brought along. 

This continues for a good ten minutes until we realize that half of the other squads haven't reported in. Lasky immediately has the bright idea to split us up and send half of the squad back to look for them, which is about the same time that all hell broke loose. 


Now, I've fought the covvies, and I've seen my fair share of shit, but this was something else. They were some kind of metal wolf, but they had weapons that cut through our armour like a hot knife through butter. The survivors hid inside some kind of alien ruin. About an hour later, *he* showed up.

Lasky, being the tactical genius he is, kept the elite spartans back with him, safe in their cave, while me and Dave, the last two marines, went with the Chief. 


We had all heard the stories, but to see it with my own eyes... It was as if he couldn't die. At least a dozen times during the fight through the jungle, I felt some sort of deja vu, as if I had been through the same section of forest and fought the same enemies again and again. 


And somehow, it looked to me like there were two of him, but that couldn't be possible. At least he was polite, and he even gave me a railgun he had picked up. 

Halfway through the next fight, he ran out of bullets. Don't know how, since everyone I know never seems to have less than a limitless supply. 
He could have asked for another mag, but no, he hits Dave ovwr the back of the head and takes the ammo off of his corpse.

This Argonian motherfucker walks in, gives Camilla this note that is supposedly from Sven, the Nord trying to date her, when clearly its not even remotely close to his handwriting. She believes this dude and now she never wants to see Sven ever again. Great, shes probably going to end up marrying that stupid Elven Bard.

Now this slimy Argonian dude comes up to me and starts selling me shit I don't need/want. Apparently he had overheard my conversation with Camilla so he asks whats up, me being a little tipsy tell him that our family heirloom has been stolen and the thieves left for Bleak Falls Barrow. Thinking I'll finally get rid of this jackass I tell him I will pay him if he can return it. He finally leaves and luckily enough he takes the elven dude, whatever his name is, with him, kill two birds with one stone amirite?

So fast forward like a day, max, that same Argonian dude waltzes back into my shop carrying the Dragonclaw.  Motherfucker, he actually got it back. Great now I have to pay this asshole. So he tells me that my recently sold shipments would suffice, so I have to give this dude 500 gold. Dude then says, wait there's more and sells me even more useless junk that I don't need and now I'm left with like 13 gold coins. Motherfucker. At least he leaves right after that, but right after he leaves I look down and the fucking Dragonclaw I put on the counter right in front of me is gone, as wells as half my inventory. That slimy asshole stole that shit right in front of me, I mean no one else has been in the shop all day. 

So I'm struggling now to keep my business afloat, I can't purchase goods to sell because I have no gold to buy them, I have a bunch of useless shit that nobody wants to buy taking up my floor space and my dragonclaw is missing again. Camilla is also fretting because that elven dude, Fendale or something, hasn't returned any of her letters. But hey, at least she won't be marrying an elf. I'm sitting at the counter, ready to fall asleep its been so dead, and that son of a bitch Argonian walks in. He ignores me completely and instead walks over to Camilla and gives her an Amulet of Mara. THIS ASSHOLE WANTS TO MARRY CAMILLA? He probably said something like Fandell wanted her to be with him or some other bullshit. Oh great, she accepted. I'm going to be related to this asshole. Uh Oh, he's walking over here uhhhh quickly thank him again for retrieving the CLAW THAT YOU STOLE!!!! He sells me more useless shit. What a complete douchebag.

He's taken my claw, stolen half my inventory, sold me useless shit I can't get rid of. Taken my sister and only other co-worker away and, to top it all off, I'm now his brother in law.

I remember walking with her on our way to Riverwood to get more materials for our house she was building. I remember the crisp night air, the cool breeze on my face. And I remember her walking beside me, still full of exuberance and mirth. I wondered then what would become of her? And I was saddened by the thoughts that followed. I knew that smile would be the first to go, battered down into a slight frown of determination, resolute to the last. And I could see her then, in forty years time. Standing atop an autumn hill, wearing the same golden elvish armor she wore then. But her skin is no longer warm with the beaming glow of youth, but aged by the wrinkles of time. No more is her radiant red hair, it has been dulled to the color of the  dried autumn grass. And in her expression you see a tired persistence, an exhausted conviction and you think; ""Here is a woman who has done so much, yet left so little behind.""

And I wept for her, my beloved companion. My Alira, my Harbinger, Dovahkiin. You are remembered. I live here still, in our house together near Falkreath. But I must go, the hour is late and I must retire.

Two and they were on their way to fabled lands. He didn’t have the patience for people getting back up. Either they answered the question or they went down. 


He was Maven’s man. She was the mother he couldn’t remember, the lover he never had and the family he never really wanted. The only one he answered to. She was a one word hitter. Do. Go. Now. 


They called him Maven’s pit-wolf, though not to his face. One look from him could freeze the words in a preacher’s mouth. Crowds not only parted for him, they never gathered. If he wanted you, you stopped, you waited, you answered, or you joined your ancestors far before your time.


He watched and he listened and he knew. He’d only chat if the price was right.


Riften was a part of him. He could walk the boardwalk, the docks and the Ratway backwards in a drugged sleep. He knew all its residents, all their stories, all their secrets and all their shames.


He never felt fear or love or pain. 
 

On occasion the girl in the bunkhouse pleased him. She took his money, she never spoke and she did as he wished. It was as simple an act as swapping coin for mead at the Inn. He chose not to remember her name.


He had needs he tried, but could not deny. He hated that moment he lost control, that one tiny betrayal of cursed vulnerability. 


He never felt fear or love or pain, until today.




 
Today was the day he saw the swollen purple bruise on the girl’s face and the bloodied cut on her lip. Today he saw the tears brimming in her honey-coloured eyes and the look of desolation on her face. 


She automatically undressed before him in her tiny room. Maul found himself noticing details he’d missed before; the small posy of mountain flowers on the bedside table, the smell of lavender rising from the worn bed covers, how neatly she folded her dress, the cascade of bruises across her shoulders and down her back, the bloodied shallow dagger’s slice across her breast.


She stood naked before him, silent tears running down her face and falling onto her body, dampening her wound and staining her belly with soft splashes of pink.


He could not speak. He could not move. He felt an overwhelming conflict of rage and longing coursing through him that froze his thoughts.


“Who?” He finally managed to say.


She answered, the only words she’d ever shared.


He left her standing and with unnatural speed he left the bunkhouse and crossed the square, the Fishery his target. His prey was packing salmon and Maul lifted the man into the air and slammed his thin dark body onto the barrel. Blood streamed from the man’s broken face and he shrieked in pain and astonishment. Maul released him and he stumbled on the slippery boards.


Maul didn’t see the swift flick of the Dunmer’s arm, didn't see the razor-sharp Elven dagger and didn’t know it was that which slid sharply into his side under the steel armour he always wore.


He did see the look of bitter fury that lit the man’s face and shone through the mess of blood, he did see when his own hands gripped Ulen’s neck and crushed his bones. He did see the moment life left the husk of an Elf before him. He saw the dark stained bloody boards rise towards him, he felt cold fear puncture his heart as he realised this blood was his own and and he tried and failed to fight the waterfall of roaring darkness that overwhelmed him.

Maul had never felt fear or love or pain, until today. Today, he felt them all.

*April 23rd*

*I don't think I'll understand our newest resident. Not just his actions, either. There seems to be a language barrier. He speaks some strange, guttural tongue with weird symbols. He's taken to trading with a few of the villagers, though... It took us a while to figure out what he wanted when he would walk up to us and wave emeralds.  I'm impressed that he figured out our currency so quickly though. This outsider has more than earned his welcome here, in my opinion. The Priest is still very skiddish around him, but no longer locks the door when he approaches. May take a while for him to relax, understandable after what he's been through.*

*April 25th*

*I'll be damned.. It started out as just a simple wall, but now there's a walkway on top for sentries. More of the Automatons patrol the perimeter of the wall. A few of our scouts have been able to go up and look out over the plains. So far, nothing to report, they say. That's good, I guess. Our visitor has been gone for some time.  He's got something in that shack of his. I took a walk earlier this morning and noticed he had added a new window. There are two large chests and a hole in the ground. Where could it lead?* 

*April 27th*

*There are.... Strange things on the walls now. They look like snowmen. They, and the Automatons seem to be working in tandem to stop spiders from getting over the wall. Impressive. Still no idea about the hole in the floor of the shack.  But, lately, we've been hearing this strange noise underground. Some strange warping wail.  We'd been hearing a lot of digging underground, ever since the creature arrived. What is he up to? The Priest fears for the worst. Maybe I'll ask him... Find a way to communicate.*

*April 30th*

*No dice... Didn't understand a word I said...  As I was trying to talk to him, he built a Blacksmith's Forge and home. Rather quickly, at that. Well that's dandy and all, but we don't have a blacksmith anymore! He died in the first raid of our town. Oh well... Maybe someone will try their hand at it. Farms are doing well, and there's even livestock. Gotta focus more on that now. Just got word that there are pregnancies, we'll need all the food we can get.*

I’d said prisoners, but really we had only one. He was a scruffy looking individual with mismatched armour and a furtive look. He’d swiped a sweet roll from the Inn and had protested that he’d thought his 10 gold had covered dinner. I’d given him the benefit and asked Hulda but she crossed her arms and shook her head, telling me he'd already started two fights.  So I’d dragged him up to the barracks, the fellow grumbling all the way.

I’d checked all his gear in the lockbox and it was a fair haul. Caius... I beg pardon, COMMANDER (as he constantly reminds us) Caius had instituted a new rule that we list all items confiscated from prisoners. Mainly because he’d discovered some of the guards had taken to arresting Brenuin just to 'impound' any mead he had. 

I’d argued against it, not only because it was pointless, but mainly as I knew I’d be the only one doing it. It took almost an hour, 6 pieces of precious paper and 2 quills. This one was a real packrat. One thing stood out, an heavy odd shaped piece of stone with strange writing on it and what looked like a map.

I'd searched around, found some more paper and charcoal and traced it out. It was definitely a map of Skyrim that one mark was near Morthal, my home.

I now had the map tucked away in my cuirass and wandered over to chat to the prisoner. That’s when I noticed the grate was up and he was gone.  I swore.

I signed up as a guard for my city, Dunwall. It really was a beautiful place. Cobblestone streets, high, ornate clock towers, and full of kind, honest people. Well, okay, not entirely true. The people here are either humble and poor, or pompous rich pricks. But that's besides the point.

The city in itself was a great place to live, before the plague hit. People dying every which way you care to look, burned to a crisp in the streets, houses looted for whatever scavengers could find. It was chaos. That's why I signed on for the guard. I felt as a citizen of Dunwall, it was my duty to keep some semblance of order. Sure, I wasn't going to be finding cures any time soon, but the pay is good, and it's better than sitting around under a bridge waiting to waste away.

Our great and powerful city was ruled by an equally great and powerful empress, name of Jessamine. And boy, was she a looker. At least, she was, til she got herself killed. By her own bodyguard, no less! Corvo was his name. He got himself a death sentence in Coldridge, and was held there for a day or so. Bastard escaped and was on the loose for quite a while.

'Twas around this time I was assigned to Kaldwin Bridge. I had advanced quite a bit, for Exemplary Service. In actuality, I'd only caught a couple of petty thieves and looters, but I guess that's good enough for the higher-ups. My men and I were protecting Anton Sokolov, a painter and inventor. Man was a genius, but paranoid as all hell. Had half the city guard protecting him, and lived 10 stories off the ground, easy. No idea what he was so scared of, but I wasn't the one to ask questions with the coin he was offering.

Watch seemed to be going well, at first. Then we started getting word of some of our guards disappearing further away from the bridge. Being an officer, and not wanting to be bothered by some Weepers or whatever the hell was causing the disappearances, I had a few guards to throw around. Sent them down that way, and they didn't come back either. If you want something done right, they says. Hope Sokolov doesn't mind a few officers gone missing...

I managed to make my way down to the reported area without much trouble. What I saw there, however, was just bizarre. Where there should have been a full complement of guards, there was no one. I started looking around, although I won't lie, I was a tad spooked. Weepers are too damned dull to hide bodies, and why would looters bother?  

It didn't take me long to find what I was looking for. I entered one of the old boarded-up houses, and found piles of guards in there. None of them were dead, however. Just unconscious. Some had darts in their backs, filled with some kind of green liquid. Others had marks on their necks, like they had been... choked?

The mystery solved itself as I felt arms close round my thoat.

I woke up alongside my comrades, only to find that Sokolov had been abducted. 10 coins says it was the asshole who systematically knocked out my entire company. I didn't get paid that week.

A while later, Emily had turned up, along with... Corvo? Where the hell had he been all this time? Well, it didn't take that long for people to work it out. He was the one going around kidnapping and murdering all these people. Granted, most of them were complete idiots, but still.

And what happens next? Dunwall has a child for a queen and Corvo becomes the royal protector again. Fuck this place.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_17eh40,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/17eh40/dishonored_assassins_and_ingenious_political/,

I was doing a patrol of the local area that the new guy took over. As I was patrolling, I actually saw the new guy driving on the road we were on.

I braked hoping that he wouldn't hit me. Thankfully he passed me perfectly fine. I look in the rear-view mirror, and see the bridge that I just passed over.

As I stare, I realized he is approaching it at the wrong angle. He then barrels through the wooden guard rail, and rolls off the cliff! A second later, his car explodes and the fire starts spreading everywhere. Well, crap. Did our entire operation that relied on this one guy, end because of his stupidity? With those videos I've seen, of the terrible car accidents in Russia, this guy must have been russian...

I sit here, and start reaching for my radio to call this in, but then I see him climbing the side of the cliff back onto the main road, and was on fire while doing it. What the hell?! That was a 20 foot drop, and an explosion! He gets up, puts the fire out by patting himself down, and runs over to my car.

I stare at him in utter amazement. How did you live? He says he wants my vehicle. Well, crap. It's at least a 2 mile walk back to base, and I was just driving back, but what was I gonna say? No? Then people will get pissed at me. I let him have it, watch him drive off, nearly falling off agian, and start making my way back.

Not like life in the Kerbin Air Force was all that exciting anyway.

I’ve seen the results of some of these launches; or heard of them at least. Technological contraptions of carnage and despair. How am I supposed to tell Thormmick’s wife she’ll never see him again because some egghead overestimated the amount of fuel and thrust needed to get him to the Mun, and now he’s lost in deep space? Then there was Zach whose rocket just flew apart and exploded on the pad when the launch stability enhancers failed to release. Even *I* barely made it out alive when the rocket I was on broke apart because the staging was out of order! Only Control’s quick thinking and a generous number of parachutes on my command pod kept me and Jeb alive! Speaking of Jeb…

I think that guy’s got a screw or dozen loose. Our whole way up he was smiling and laughing-even when the rocket pitched 90 degrees in less than a second! I think he's either insane and or that nurse he’s sleeping with is giving him something *strong* to keep him happy.

I hope my next flight in that monstrosity on the runway goes better than Phil’s flight did. I don’t want to end up as a smear on a mountain 10,000 kilometers away any more than I bet he did. The dreaded words have been spoken over the intercom-“Bill Kerbin, report to the spaceplane staging area.”

*May 17th*

*The news of this chamber didn't go over as well with the Priest as I expected... That was a foolish move on my part... We were able to catch a glimpse into the sealed off chamber, thanks to the construction of that door. The whole room is made of a glistening stone as black as night... Almost like glass. ""Obsidian"", is what the Priest called it. Very durable stone. Pretty. The Wanderer, as we've taken to calling him, has constructed an archway from the stone and it seems to be a gateway to some other realm. That swirling purple vortex holds many mysteries for us. I shudder to think what lies in wait on the other side. Across from it, there are several stands with glass bottles, brewing strange potions... I do hope these could potentially save those of us whom had been taken in the Raids.*

*May 21st*

*The temple has been completely restored, and seems to have a few additional fixtures. Lights, and doors... The walls have been fully extended, and as I write this, he is removing the partition. My my, this is a lot of space... We're gaining a large pond with this expansion. No more dangerous treks to the nearest river for fish. That is good. Our farms and livestock are flourishing, but with the recent births, we'll need to stay ahead of it all. It would seem that the Wanderer was not expecting to see children so soon. Do his kind propagate slower? Damn this language barrier.. There is so much we could learn from each other.*

*May 22nd*

*The Priest is quite happy with the new temple. The old one is being converted into what seems like an Inn, by the Wanderer. Don't get very many travelers here, but what the hell, why not? All of that space to expand has been filled with more houses, neatly in rows.  A few new farms have been cultivated as well. He may be kind of strange, but he's doing good work for us.*

*May 23rd*

*There's a pit on the far side of the village... Entirely made of Obsidian... Sprung up.... Went in?... Over night. What I saw in there chilled me to the bone.. Three creepers looking up at me from the high balcony looking into the pit. When I got there, he was building a canopy over it...  It looks like some strange arena...

He takes one of her cabbages and uses a telekinesis spell to throw it on to the roof of Belethor's store so it rolls off the roof into a bucket! I tell him to watch it, But he doesn't even look at me. He keeps doing this for about 10 minutes. During that time I warn him to Watch the Magic three or four times, He still doesn't stop. After about 5 minutes he throws it especially high, then after landing on the roof, It rolls of and hits me in the leg. It hurt my knee a lot because I was hit in that knee with an arrow in my adventuring days. But anyway, I get out my sword. I just wanted to warn the guy! Scare him off maybe. But the most amazing thing happened, He used a Tu'um! He shouted Fus ro rah or something and I went flying backwards! But of course I had to arrest or kill him, But he used another Thu'um and it froze me solid! I never saw him again, but I heard he got off with some bullshit excuse about being Thane.

I'm 23, and I used to work for the US Army before I got discharged for ""disorderly conduct"" or some shit, I don't know. But my buddy, Jim, told me about this new gig on some island in the Pacific. Said I'd get paid plenty by this guy Hoyt to be a ""Privateer"". I don't give a shit what they're called or who I work for. I figured, long as I get a gun and something to shoot at, I'm good.

So, Jim tells Hoyt about me, and someone sends a freakin' plane to get me! Cool, huh?

Well, I get there, and Jim leads me into this big cave with a river running through it, and in there is this big boat. Some guy, who I later learned was Hoyt, made some big speech about this guy, ""Jason Brody"" or something, then set a guy in a cage on fire. Let me tell you, the smell of burning flesh is... sweet, like pork. And it sickens you to think so.

I didn't pay much attention. The job's simple, right? Take this rifle, patrol this outpost, hit the alarm if this Jason Brody character or any of the natives, Rock Yachts or some stupid shit, show up. We've got better weapons and training, so we should be able to take on some kid or some shithead natives.

One day, I'm patrolling by the road when something catches my eye. What was that? I stop and look towards it. I thought I saw a... glint of something. I look closely where I saw it, and I swear I can *almost* make out a figure in a blue shirt and khakis, but I can't be sure. 

I start to take out my binoculars, but then one of the big guys in heavy armor and an LMG yells at me, saying ""Rick! Get the fucking lead outta your boots and keep moving!""

I figured it was nothing, so I just kept watching. This island gets hot, and I'm really fuckin' hungry, so I was probably just seeing things.

I keep walking, and I start to near my buddy Garrett. He's standing behind a waste-high concrete wall that's facing the road. He's just out of sight of the heavy who yelled at me, so he's taking a moment to rest. 

""Hey man."" I say to him.

""Howdy, pal."" Garrett says with a smirk. ""Get yelled at by Hugo?""

""That the heavy?""

""Yeah, he's a cunt. I guess it's *too hard* for him to move around in that armor too much. Gotta save that precious energy for when Brody shows up. Like he'd ever-""

A gunshot cut off Garrett. The side of his face closer to the road was blown away, and he fell. I freaked the fuck out. ""Holy crap!"" I yelled. Crap? Who the fuck says crap any more?

I realized I was in the line of sight of whoever just shot. I dropped down behind the concrete wall just as another buried itself in the wall of the building behind me.

I hear Hugo yelling some stupid intimidation shit. ""Little boys shouldn't play with guns!"" 

""Shut the fuck up, Hugo."" I mutter under my breath. Like that's gonna make this guy any less willing to blow our brains out.

I don't know what to do. I've never dealt with something like this. In the Army, I didn't leave Utah. And every time I killed one of the natives, they had been tied up. I never realized how terrifying active combat was. 

Hugo comes lumbering out from the other side of the building, and Andre, the resident sniper, starts scanning the hills past the road. He seems to find a target, because he stops, then fires. I hear a yell from the hills, but a second later, another bullet embeds itself in the wall half a foot from Andre's face, so the guy attacking us isn't dead yet.

Suddenly, I remember what I'm supposed to do. I look and see the alarm box not 20 yards away. Right out in the open.

""Fuck it."" I mutter. I run from cover, firing in the general direction I saw Andre shoot at, hoping that that keeps this guy down for a second.

I'm about to reach the box when it blasts open. No idea if that bullet was meant for me or the box, but what matters is the box is dead.

I slide behind another concrete wall just as another gunshot sounds, and Andre falls down. I see Hugo walking towards the hill. I'm terrified at this point. If Hugo goes down, I'm the last one here, and I wasn't told of any other way to call for backup around here.

I start to take out the mag of my rifle when I hear Hugo start to fire that PKM of his. Sounds like fireworks. I peek over the wall in time to see Hugo fall to his knee as a bullet flies out out his back. He starts to stand up before another bullet whizzes through his helmet, and he falls over.

""Oh god. Oh god. Oh sweet Jesus god."" I whimper. I'm a wuss, sure, but this can only be *the* Jason Brody. I thought I could take him myself, but after singlehandedly clearing this outpost (barring me), I wasn't so sure.

I looked around the wall a tiny bit, just enough to see a guy in a blue shirt and khakis walk down the hill, this big sniper rifle in his hands. Shit, I thought. That's him.

He glances at Hugo's body, then keeps walking past him. He slings the rifle on his back and draws a fucking .44 magnum, like some fucking Dirty Harry impersonator. He holds it almost casually, like she's not expecting anyone else.

I don't know what else to do. I'm out of options. I slide my rifle out from cover, followed by my M1911. I can tell he's immediately on guard. I yell out ""I'm not armed! I surrender!""

I don't hear anything, so I stand up slowly. The moment I'm all the way up, a bullet from his revolver tears into my stomach. The pain is incredible, but somehow, I'm still on my feet. So, another bullet rips into me, this time into my chest, probably my heart.

I fall down and immediately scream. ""Oh god it hurts! Oh my god!"" From there, screaming just takes over. Everything starts to go black as Jason walks to me. He looks down at me, and I can see, in his lifeless, blank eyes.

He may have killed me. But I think we won in the end. Even if he didn't die, he's not much of a human anymore.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1i4fgp,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1i4fgp/far_cry_3_this_place_is_crazy/,

At least people can sleep now, not that it is much fun sharing in the barracks. The men like to strip off their damp cuirasses and stoke up the fire and it is so cold they don’t wash, so the smell! I sleep in the Inn, these days; I’m not stripping in front of them.  They make jokes enough about enchanting their swords and “sweet rolls”.


The uniforms are not snow-proof, so they chafe in uncomfortable places and your helmet just freezes to your nose.  And what am I gonna pad it with grass pods? 


All day long, all you hear is the constant sound of pickaxes.

We had a dragon attack once, and by the time I ran back from my post at Iron-breaker mine, it was just skin and bones, well mainly bones. Didn’t get to loose one arrow!

A bug trainer, minding my own business, just chilling in the forest. When out of nowhere, I see a newcomer walking by, so naturally, being a trainer, I walk up to him and challenge him. Being a bug trainer, I figured this would be tough but I was in for a surprise.

I sent out my level 40 Scolipede, and he sends out a Samurott at level 42, so it was pretty evenly matched at this point. I commanded my Scolipede to use Steamroller, but his Samurott used Surf first and nearly took me out. A turn later, Samurott was at about 70% HP and Scolipede was down. This is where things started to get weird. 

Even though I was mostly a bug trainer, that'd be too obvious if I just used one type. So I did have one ace in the hole, and I decided to pull it early. But without batting an eye, as I returned Scolipede and readied another PokeBall, he returned Samurott and did the same. We cast our PokeBalls at the same time, and Excadrill exploded out of my PokeBall... and a Hitmonlee burst out of his. He knew what Pokemon I was going to send out before I threw it! What the fuck?

Even though I was at a disadvantage, I had to try my best against this seemingly psychic trainer. I commanded Excadrill to use Earthquake, but too late, because hit Hitmonlee quickly ended Excadrill's reign with a swift Hi-Jump Kick. I returned Excadrill and readied my last Pokemon. Again, the trainer followed suit. By this time, I had already assumed he would send out a type to counter mine, but I cast my PokeBall just the same, and Yanmega came out. When his PokeBall opened, in a flash of blinding light, mother fucking Groudon was revealed. WHAT IN THE FUCK, DUDE. THIS THING IS FROM HOENN, GOD FUCKING DAMN IT.

I tried to return my Pokemon, but his Groudon knocked my PokeBall aside as he smirked and said, ""There's no running from a trainer battle."" Then, in a moment of pure terror, he called to his Pokemon, ""Groudon, use Fire Blast!"" His Groudon inhaled deeply, disturbing the surrounding foliage, and then unleashed an unholy torrent of flames onto my Yanmega. Yanmega instantly dissolved into ash, resting on the forest floor as the rest of the forest was sent ablaze. The trainer, seemingly unaware of the wildfire, came up to me and collected his payment, as was the custom for losing a Pokemon battle. After I handed him my money in tears, the bastard returned his Groudon and pulled out yet another PokeBall. He sent out another fucking legend that shouldn't even exist here; a mother fucking Rayquaza.

I knew what was happening immediately, It was those bastard companions. They didn't want their damn power that they begged for anymore. 

So what, we messed it up a little and made it a permanent thing, but they asked for it. If only they just asked for us to give them the scroll that would cure them, I'd be happy to oblige. 

My second sister just sent her troll after the little heathen, he felled it in one blow, then her, removed her head too! This is one greedy companion. 

I stood my ground in my section of the cave, breathing hard, that damn cold I've got has destroyed my lungs. I have the worst wheeze. Makes me sound like some sort of shedevil. 

Anyway, the killer blow never came. He just left. Now I'm stuck here with my two headless sisters. The bastard took their heads. At least I've still got my troll.

A few months ago I met the man of my dreams. When he wandered into the Riverwood Trader my brother Lucan and I were in a fight. Someone had stolen our prized golden claw. I wanted to take it upon myself to pursue the claw but Lucan insisted it was too dangerous. This nord who had wandered in offered to get it back for us and Lucan was overjoyed. He returned the next day with the claw and he stayed to chat a while. Instantly I knew I wanted to marry this man. To hell with Sven and Faendal. The man of my dreams disappeared into the night and I never thought I would see him again. A short while later he returned to the Riverwood trader and said he had come from Riften. He was wearing an amulet of Mara and asked for my hand in marriage. I obliged happily and the ceremony was the following day. I agreed to move into his house in Whiterun against the wishes of Lucan (selfish bastard didn't want to work a double shift). Life was great with my new husband. I was able to open a small store to keep myself occupied while he was out adventuring. I worried that something bad would happen to him but he was a strong nord and I knew he would always return to me. One day while my husband was away I was at the Bannered Mare when I heard that the emperors cousin was getting married in Solitude. The emperors cousin! What a beautiful ceremony that would be! Hulda told me that the reception was open to the public and I began to dream of going. I had never been to the capital and decided that when my husband returned I would talk to him about attending the reception. He came home two days later and when I brought up the subject of going to solitude for the wedding he rejected the idea firmly. I was disappointed but I loved my husband and respected his authority. The day after the wedding word came to Whiterun that the emperors cousin had been murdered at her wedding! In the following days rumors that the Dark Brotherhood carried out the assassination were spreading like wildfire. My husband came home and said he was only in town for the night. Over dinner we discussed the rumors and he laughed at the thought of the Dark Brotherhood being responsible for a murder that high profile. He said the Brotherhoods glory days were gone and they wouldn't dare attempt anything so big and that was the end of the conversation. We went to bed and for the first time I began to wonder if I really knew who my husband was, but being so devoted to him I didn't let those thoughts stick around. The following day he announced he was leaving and said he may be gone for a couple of weeks. I made him a homemade meal and kissed him before he left. Surprisingly he returned just two days later and said that he would be home for exactly three days before he left again. Three days later I went to the market to buy some fresh meat from the wood elf to prepare a meal for my husband before he set off. While there I saw a soldier who wore armor I had never seen before. According to Ysolda he was with the Pentius Oculatus. The emperors personal soldiers! I returned home and began cooking my meal. After dinner my husband said he needed to leave that night and couldn't wait till morning. He was headed for Markarth to meet an old friend. I kissed him goodbye yet again and watched my love walk out the door, This time he was going to Markarth and I was left wondering if maybe just maybe this is the last time he would leave me. I awoke the next morning to a shrill scream followed by more screams of ""MURDER! MURDER!"" Terrified, I jumped out of bed and ran outside. I could see a crowd gathering in front of the Bannered Mare and ran to see what was going on. The Pentius Oculatus agent was laying on the ground, throat slit, eyes completely void of life. It was a gruesome sight and only a moment passed before the guards moved in to investigate the scene. The asked for witnesses to come forward but no one saw anything. One guard searched the purse on the body and pulled out a letter. After reading it he looked at his fellow guardsmen and said ""By the eight, he was going to kill the emperor."" An assassination attempt on the emperors life?!? The crowd was shocked! The next few days around Whiterun all anybody could talk about was the murder in town and the plot on the emperors life. A courier in town who was having a drink at the Bannered Mare said that a chef had been murdered in Markarth, and an Orc who some suspected was the gourmet had been murdered at the Nightgate Inn. The courier said word around Skyrim was that the Dark Brotherhood was behind it all. Two days later my husband didn't return home like he had said he would but I had gotten used to him being a few days late. The next day at the Bannered Mare a guard came in and reported that a Dark Brotherhood assassin killed the emperors decoy and managed to escape solitude! I began to seriously worry, could my husband be behind this? I filled my tankard with wine and downed it with one gulp. No. He's a good man, he wouldn't do such a thing. I left the Bannered Mare and walked home, hoping to see my husband had returned. When I arrived at our house there was a letter nailed to the door. I walked inside and sat down to read it. This is what it said. 

""My dearest Camilla, 

By now you will have heard about the Dark Brotherhoods attempt on the emperors life. In the following days you will also hear something quite disturbing. You will hear that it was I who carried out this attack and I regret to inform you that it is true. It was also I who killed the Pentius Oculatus agent, the chef in Markarth, the gourmet, and the emperors cousin. I do not have time to explain to you my reasons for choosing this path in life but do know, that I love you. I am on my way to Solitude to kill Commander Maro and the REAL emperor of Tamriel. You may find comfort in knowing that this is the end of the Dark Brotherhood. We were betrayed by one of our own and after this those of us who survived must go into hiding. Goodbye my love, maybe one day I will be able to return to you."" 

 I sat by the fire and cried until the sun rose the next morning. When I finally gained my composure I picked up the iron dagger I carried with me and slit my wrist wide open. I covered the palm of my hand in blood and placed my hand print on the door, leaving the mark of the brotherhood. Then I ran the knife across my throat and into the void I went....",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1an7m8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1an7m8/skyrim_my_husbands_dark_secret/,

Uh, this is a bit awkward. They told me to make a journal with the recording equipment in my helmet so... Uh, I just joined the Marines, the training is going pretty well and Pop said he would make sure I would be stationed here on Reach so I would be around for holidays. Hopefully I will still get to see some action, so I can show those rebels what it is like to fight a real man. *A voice off screen shouts ""Lights out!""* Well, I got to go. I guess this was kind of cathartic.

Log 2: *The same man, slightly older, is standing outside a large glass building. He is viably excited.* I just finished training, top of my class! I don't really do these logs much, but I felt that this moment should be captured and this seemed like the best way to do it. 

Log 3: *The man is now a few years older, sitting in a dark room with a cot against the wall.*. They say we were attacked. Not by rebels, but by aliens. Aliens more advanced than we are. They say their ships are unstoppable, and that there are trillions of them. They say a lot of things... I didn't believe a word until I started seeing the bodies, burnt to a crisp, the skin where they got hit is burnt like... a marshmallow that is dropped into a fire. Their armor didn't do SHIT! THEY GIVE US THESE WEAPONS, TELL US WE ARE THE BEST TRAINED MEN IN THE WHOLE DAMN GALAXY AND THEN WE GET TORN TO FUCKING SHREDS!

Log 4: *The man is much more downtrodden than the last video, he has dark circles under his eyes and he slouches as he talks.* The covenant has crushed almost all opposition to their rampage through the colonized systems. The media, and propaganda, have tried to spin it like we are wining, and these are ""tactical retreats"". More like running for our fucking lives. I've seen the casualties; I've talked to the soldiers. We won't win this war. All we can do is hope they don't find our planet.

Log 5: *The man seems much less depressed than last time, but has a hint of fear in his voice.* They hit Reach. I don't know how they landed on the most defended planet in the whole damn galaxy without us knowing, but they did. We tried to fight back, just like we always do, but it wasn't enough. We blew up one of their damn cruisers and they just sent 50 more. Pop made sure he and mom got out on a military transport, so I think they are okay but I haven't heard from them since they left. I have been redeployed to The Pillar of Autumn, and will be one of the last off the planet. This will probably be my last log. 

Log 6: *The man is now in a cave like structure with brown rock walls and rows of cots. Faint voices of other men can be heard behind his.* By some miracle we made it past the Covenant blockade, and then as soon as we came out of slip space we get boarded and have to abandon ship. Now we're stuck on some forerunner ring in the middle of fuckin' nowhere! *A man in the background yells ""Hey, shut up over there""* Sorry sir!

Log 7: *The man is on the inside of a Pelican, the sounds of it's engines can be heard in the background. There are men to his left and right.* The Master Chief was able to rescue Captain Keyes, I'm not sure where we would be if he wasn't here. Now we have been divided into two groups. Half of us went with the Master Chief to try and find some Forerunner map, and the other half are going with Captain Keyes to try and find some Forerunner weapon. I got put with Keyes, and... *One of the soldiers next to the man nudges him, ""Oh, shut the fuck up already? Can't you see that some of us are trying to concentrate""* Fuck off Jenkins, you know this is how I psych myself up.

Log 8: *The man is in a strange building with slate gray walls with lines of light built into them. The man is visibly shaken and their is fear in his voice.* We found something else. Something far worse than the covenant. They are pure evil, whatever they are. Little gray things that burrow into you and... Make you come back, but you aren't you. You're... them. I don't know... We lost contact with the Captain a little while ago and one of those things got on the Sargent. We tried to pull it off but it was too late. We had to put him down... We didn't kill him, because he wasn't human anymore. We just... put him down. The men say I am in charge now, but I don't feel like much of a leader. I guess I am just going to try to get them out of here... No matter what.

Log 9: *The man is sitting on a grey block that is about 4 feet tall. There is a jackal sitting next to him and appears to be keeping a lookout. Strange noises can he heard all around, like running water.* We found some Covies, but they didn't attack. They have been slaughtered by these things just as much as we have. There was a bit of a language barrier but through signs we were able to agree to work together to get out of this place. We also found an area that the flood have to come through to get out, there isn't any other way around according to my Jackal friend here. *The man forces a slight laugh* He and I agreed to stay behind and hold the bottleneck while the rest of the men retreat. I hope they make it out okay. If anyone finds these logs on... on my body, please give them to my parents if they are still alive. Tell them... Tell them I love... *The Jackal stand up and begins to fire at something off screen* Oh shit! This is Lieutenant Garth Karl signing off! DIE YOU SONS OF...


Note: This is my first Reddit post ever, so if this is the wrong subreddit for this sort of thing, my bad. Any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. 
The story is based off of this marine and Jackal you find dead in Halo CE (And maybe anniversary, I never played it). They appear to have stood together against the flood in a vain effort to survive. For some reason those two bodies lying together stuck with me more than anything else from the Halo series. The italics were put in because these are supposed to be video logs documenting the life of the marine. 
Anyway, it was kind of long and I hope at least one person enjoyed reading it. ~~I will try to take a screenshot of the two bodies later today and add it at the end~~ Turns out it is a bitch to take a screenshot in Halo CE (PC version).

Location: No idea...

Diary Entry 421:

I can't believe this shit. 

A few months ago, I got assigned to a federation cruiser with some green captain who clearly has no idea what he's doing. We're tasked with this ridiculously bullshit mission to deliver some information across the ENTIRE fucking galaxy in hopes of saving what's left of our pathetic fleet. I can't believe they entrusted the future of our government with this guy; he has a hard time opening doors without killing every crew member on the ship. He thinks releasing all the air in our rooms is a great way to put out fires, almost as if he never considered the fact that we need to breath too. Anyhow, we fucking manage to get through the first couple of galaxies fine. We stocked up on some weapons, and even though I advised he invest in some shielding or a defense drone, this nitwit believes a strong offense is the only type of defense. Eventually (I knew this would happen) we run across a Mantis patrol ship; if you're new to this universe, these cunts are usually armed to the teeth and this time they came at us with an array of missile-based weapons. They bombard the living shit out of us, and because my captain can't fucking think straight, he waits 30 goddamn minutes before turning on the engines to prepare the FTL jump. We barely. fucking. make it. Down to 10% of hull integrity and enough fires to cook a Crystal, we stumble upon a store and spend the last of our credits on some missiles. The next galaxy, we hit nothing (which I thought was a blessing at first, but have now realized was a complete curse). Our fleet was at the next galaxy, so we warp in and are immediately told of the ""situation"". Apparently, there's one mean mother of a flagship waiting to take out our HQ, so they commission our moron of a captain to take 'em out. We're COMPLETELY out of missiles and drone parts, so to compensate the bright minds leading our glorious fleet give us fuel. FUEL. We were so fucked. 

After a few hours we catch this ridiculous looking ship, and all I can think of is our imminent death. But no, somehow our brain dead captain manages to whittle the ships health down to nothing, and we watch it explode. 
Well, we thought we watched it explode. Turns out only PART of it explodes, and the remaining part somehow manages to fucking move forward. Most of the crew was celebrating at our victory until the fleet admirals let us know that our HQ is still threatened because breaking off of ONE THIRD OF A SHIP APPARENTLY DOESN'T KILL IT. So, we do it again! Our captain, who just barely passes for literate, manages to destroy the other fucking third of this goddamn ship. AND IT STILL LIVES. At this point, I knew we were dead. We had 20% hull integrity, 5 missiles left, and had lost about half of our crew. It was me and two other schlubs stuck with manning the helm, weapons, shields, and engine. Our captain gives us the order to warp into the final sector, where our HQ is. He tells us this is the final battle, and if we can survive here we'll win. 

Somehow, after heavy fighting we've nearly got them. Our lasers managed to rip through their shields, our defense drone (which our dumbass captain FOUND and JUST started using) is barely keeping our shields up. They had some ridiculous ""super weapon"" that fucked us over a few times and fires are destroying our ship piece by piece, but one last missile would take them out. And then... their Zoltan shields recharge. Which is normally impossible, but this cunt of a ship is apparently the baddest mother fucking thing in the universe. And a fucking breach missile makes it past our drone and drives straight into the hull. Our ship fucking explodes and the last thing I hear are the cries of the crew. 

Except... I didn't die. I was repairing the oxygen room at the time and because of my oh so lucky Zoltan-genetics, I managed to survive. Unfortunately, my captain was also managing the oxygen room with me when our ship was destroyed. So, now I'm left here alone with my dumbass captain in the oxygen room wondering how the fuck we're going to survive floating in space. Well, at least we both got to enjoy the sight of our federation being annihilated; serves them right for putting this dumbass in charge. Why didn't I sign up with the Engis?

*May 10th*

*So far, things have been very quiet. No more digging underground, that we can hear... It spanned the whole village, maybe even beyond these walls... Whatever our guest has been doing, it must be nearing completion. He left the village on another trip, as he usually does, three days ago. That's alright. Gives us some time to try and find a way to get in that shack and see what he's doing. The Priest is nigh off his own skull in fear.  I keep telling him that our guest has done nothing but improve life for us here, but he's not having any of it.*

*May 11th*

*What. The. Hell!? It would seem our guest has returned from his journey, mostly.  This morning we heard this loud roaring explosion and our scouts report that a nearby hill has been demolished to a rubble-filled crater. Needless to say, The Priest is catatonic at this point. It wasn't within the walls, but I should try to have another go at talking to him.  There is something going on in the dunes.. It seems he's excavating something.. Some ruined temple, it seems, from a forgotten age. My.. He has a knack for restoring ancient architecture. I wonder where he picked it up?*

*May 15th*

*He restored the ancient temple... There's construction going on around it.. Is he planning on extending the Wall? What purpose would such a structure serve us? Or him? We could use the room though... He's been gone a while. Long enough that our scouts have found something. A strange doorway just under one of the gardens. Apparently it was operated by a lever, and he left it open. I've sent a crew down to investigate. No word yet, but I hope there's nothing nefarious going on.*

*May 15th (Revisited)*

*What the hell is he?! The scouts just returned. Took them a better part of the day to explore it, but there is a vast, sprawling complex right beneath our feet! They say it is large enough to house three times our village's number with room to spare... Brightly lit, ornately decorated... And so many different rooms. A bed chamber fit for a king of legend, a library and some strange table with a spinning book. A storage room with an anvil and workbenches. A kitchen... There was another sealed off chamber, but they couldn't get into it. They could hear that warping sound through the metal door, though. We must be careful in there.*

Churminek should have been back with the cow. He looked off towards the ugly silhouette of the man-town. Its shape offended him and he often contemplated how to break it back down into the curve and cut and edge of rock and the sway and reach and green of tree.


Ttemokamme was standing by the fire, swaying slightly, gazing off towards the herd, likely pondering the balance of time, universe and immortality as he was wont to do.


Jremsterey used his great giant club, ancestral weapon of his clan passed from father to son over 1000 years; to scratch an itch on his back he could not reach. What to do about the missing Churminek?


The night drew in and the air grew chill but Jremsterey did not feel the cold, it was but a cool gentle caress on his weathered skin. The herd was gathered in for the night and he stood silent at the edge of Camp. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply letting the smells of the Plain enter his nose and lungs. As they travelled through him he identified each part of the land and imagined himself moving back the way the air had come.


White tundra cotton, fresh tundra grass, the rough smell of cold rock, the warm musty dark smell of the wolf. Sharp, green tree smell, lavender, dirt, cobbles, sweet mountain flowers, dry ashy wood fence, crisp bitter leeks - Churminek.


The smell of Churminek reached him. Jremsterey’s eyes opened and he blinked slowly, he could not see as far as his nose could smell. He breathed deeply again shaping the parts he found - cold lifeless blood, flesh changing from person to meat and bone. Churminek who was now gone into the place of waiting, until the return. Body and shape as was left now same as dirt, same as food, same as air and rock and animal, part of all that surrounds. All that is life and land and home and purpose.


Churminek would come again and his tribe of Brothers Three would sing songs of his return, with no voice to be heard on the Plain, but as shining thoughts between their own minds. Each would mark their skin with Churminek’s rune so if he were to see them again, he would know them , and they would share their tales and Churminek would know all again.


Jremsterey turned and lumbered to the fire and the Tree. He let his arms fall, his body still, his eyes close and he slept. Churminek would come again.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1beggr,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1beggr/skyrim_a_giants_tale_xpost_skyrim/,

These guys come out from a building that they obviously didn't come in from, like they can actually use that hyperion teleporter thingy. Still don't understand why we have one of those fuckin' things. Whatever. Still, could be weirder? Well one of those guys goes up to a box and changes their face! Yeah, like pow! He now has a box for a head. He and his guys went and decided to go bother Roland and gang. Guess those guys are okay since they saved him and all.  

Seem pleasant? Well it sure as hell ain't staying that way. These dipshits decide now is a decent time to plug in a fuckin' evil AI core that lowers our shields around the city, despite putting one in a few hours ago. Guess who decides it's a good time to start shooting missiles at the city? I know Claptrap comes to mind, but think more handsome.    

So I start running like hell, watching as a bomb explodes and literally *vaporizes* some of my fellow Sanctuarians. Yeah, such a nice little sanctuary where people are 'splodin' and shit. Least they helped Scooter fix the flying thingy, so we can be lifted as a better target. Geniuses.

Anyhoo, Lilth comes out and does some hocus pocus BS and eats some of those damn rocks that Crazy Earl is so nuts for, and then everything got even weirder.  She teleports the whole goddamn city! Just all **whoosh** and *blam* and  ***purple everywhere***! And then we're in a new area, and guess who gets to skip out on cleaning up their fucking mess they left behind?

Then all the sudden I get in trouble cuz some guy who looks *exactly* fucking like me killed some other guy. Supposedly. Couldn't have been one of Jack's missiles or anything. So guess who gets to decide my fate? Yeah, those bunch of fucktards from before. Guess who they decide is guilty?  

So the guy who apparently thought when the town was going to hell was a good time to shoot some guy runs off like a little bitch, confessing, and the sheriff fucking gets me anyway!

Killed bandits aplenty, made a decent pile of coin, saved a damsel or three, even worshiped at a daedric shrine or two…then that arrow to the knee took that life away from me. It’s not so bad though really. I’ve got a wife and kid, a comfortable home, and a steady job as one of guards just outside the gate here in Solitude. Not a bad deal really. Then a dragon showed up one day while I was on duty.

I thought we were done for sure, but luckily that Dovakiin guy had just walked out of town and he was eager as Sanguine at an orgy to get into the fight with that monstrous beast. A half dozen of us rushed it when it landed, but I held back because I favor the bow. This thing breaths fire and fries a few of our guys literally *alive* (oh how their screams of pain and suffering will haunt my dreams the rest of my days) and chomps on another and throws him down the hill like a child’s doll. But the Dovakiin just stays at it the whole time.

And he’s taking one Oblivion of a beating during this. Between the swooping attacks and fire, he should be dead beyond a doubt! But randomly when he seems about ready to fall over dead from injuries there seems to be a hiccup in time and suddenly he’s back in perfect shape-no cuts, gouges, or bruises-*nothing*.

Eventually, with only the two of us left (thankfully the dragon was focusing on this seemingly unkillable Dovakiin) we slay the beast. I see the Dovakiin reach into the dissolving dragons body and pull off some scales and some bones-and these are *really* big and heavy mind you-and they…*disappear* into a pocket on his armor. Then he stands still as a statue until he absorbs its soul…after which he jogs off like nothing happened and leaves me to deal with the corpses of my fellow gate guards and one of the idiot farmers from down the hill without a word.

I know he’s Dragonborn, but that Dovakiin guy is something not of this plane.

So I'm casually walking through the town square and heading for Marcus. When all of a sudden, I hear a bit of an argument going on behind me. So I turn around and there's these two people, arguing. Ones this real fine ass bitch with colored hair and tattoos ALL over her body. Like. Fucking everywhere and she doesn't seem happy. The next person. Is a guy, real soldier type. Blond hair and all that. So this guy seems to be winning the argument. When all of a sudden, the bitch punches him STRAIGHT IN THE FACE. Thats not even the weird part! The guy? Didn't even flinch! Like, that punch was all glowing and looked as powerful as anything I've ever seen! And the guy just stops talking and stands there.

So the guy just stands there for a few seconds and then out of fucking no where, pulls out a tomahawk, and AXES the bitch, like, I know no one likes getting punched but axing someone is just a bit of an over fucking reaction don't you think? So get this! The bitch isn't even hurt!! What the fuck! 

But does it stop there? Oh of course fucking not. This massive blue dome comes out of god damn nowhere and now they're shooting at each other!!! So I'm trapped in this fucking blue dome of death apparently while these two psychopaths are trying to air each other out! 

Then the guy chucks out a little box this tiny little box, and it turns into a turret! I mean, what the fuck? Is this turret in a can over here? So there are bullets flying everywhere and I'm hiding for my fucking life! But does it get better for me? Noooooooooo, of course it fucking doesn't! 

The tattooed bitch starts just throwing fire and electricity all about the fucking place like its no god damn problem! So, I'm watching them deck it out, this bitch creates this huge energy bubble around the soldier guy and it, wait for it, you ready? IT EXPLODES!  And he's not even hurt! It looked like all his shield drained away but otherwise, totally fine. So then he pulls out FROM NOWHERE! The. Biggest. Rocket launcher. I have ever seen!! 

I'm just like, where. The. Fuck! Was he keeping that? 


So he lets loose a fucking giant barrage of rockets all over the bitch! Then I see him do this massive fist pump motion. So of course I'm thinking this girl is dead right? WRONG! The smoke clears, she's down on one knee and gets up straight away!!! Who the fuck could take ten damn rockets to the face and live!!! 

So these two people just walk towards each other and run off together like nothing the fuck happened! 

So after I know they've left for sure I get out from behind the news booth, look everywhere for these two psychopaths and only after I wait an extra ten minutes and KNOW they're gone is when I come out.

Ah, you come to hear of my cousin? It is quite the tale.

Why don't you let this guard here buy you a bottle of ale?

And take a seat as I unveil

The story of my cousin, and the danger from which he would never quail.
_________

My cousin traveled to Riften, his horse he did ride.

He heard a noise from a bush and the horse, it shied

As thieves beset him, and to take his horse, they tried.

But he drew his sword, and within moments, they were cast aside.
________

""Damn thieves,"" he said in thought,

As his horse once again began to trot,

To get to Riften, though it was a long shot

That he would find a job that would help him stay in one spot.
______

When he arrived at his destination, he realized something was amiss.

A dragon had appeared, and the city was in crisis.

It spewed flame, and buildings were burned by this.

The dragons had returned. This fact, they could not dismiss.
________

My cousin drew his sword as the dragon breathed more fire.

He climbed a building with one hand, I am no liar.

He remembered how he was dressed in leather attire,

And he realized how his situation was dire.
__________

To the top of the Bee n' Barb he came,

As the dragon dropped to the ground, within aim.

He jumped at the beast's head, which he planned to claim,

As the dragon breathed fire and set him aflame.
___________

His armor burned as he came down

Upon the beast's head as he turned reddish-brown,

After a few moments of struggling, my cousin stabbed it in its crown,

And as the beast lay dead, he knew he had saved the town.
__________

For the pain of the burns, he recieved many a muti.

His name is now said as if it were nature's beauty.

Today he traverses the land of Skyrim, and finds plenty of booty.

Now my cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.

She had taken a moment away from the party for a breath of fresh air, but was now frozen in place. Her eyes were fixed on a spot on the ground in the midst of the powder blue hydrangea bushes. A pool of blood, as crimson as the mask on her face, had soaked into the luxurious green grass. Some of the guards were milling about the area as they did their rounds, seemingly unfazed by the blood. She swallowed heavily, crossing the lawn in several strides, trying to work up some confidence. 

“What’s happened here?” She spoke louder than she intended to, the words coming out in something that sounded like a shriek. “Is someone hurt?” 

By the Abbey, it had happened. They had finally come for her. That driving force rattling the very foundation of Dunwall.  The ominous presence that kept knocking nobles and politicians from their pedestals with frightening ease. The Masked Felon. He was here at her doorstep. 

A grizzled guard strode forward. “I suppose the honest answer is ‘yes’, but it’s nothing to be concerned about, your Ladyship.” 

“Isn’t that blood?” 

The man nodded. “Aye, it is, but—” 

Her shoulders trembled again. Her heart was thumping wildly, climbing up her throat. 

“Then how is it nothing to be concerned about?” 

The puddle was the size of a serving tray. Whoever it was, they were certainly in bad shape, if not already dead.  Could she be next? She forced herself to take a sip of her wine, a mechanical gesture that was more self-assuring than thirst-quenching. 

“It’s Lord Shaw’s blood. There was a contest of honor here not long ago. A duel.” 

Waverly’s ears perked up. 

“A duel?” 

He nodded again. 

“Aye, your Ladyship. It was between Lord Shaw and Treavor Pendleton. Well, it was Shaw and a representative of Pendleton’s. I believe it was over the…incident at the Giovanni Opera House.” 

“Oh…” That made sense, then. 

There were those in the Estate District still whispering about the Opera House Incident, although it had been over a month ago. Waverly detested opera, but Lydia had been there and she had eagerly described everything. The Giovanni Opera House had been putting on a fantastic performance of ‘The Whaler’s Dream’. During intermission, Lady Shaw had disappeared from her opera box, returning only moments before the curtain rose for the second act, looking distinctly ruffled and wearing a good deal less lipstick. In the dark, Lord Shaw watched his wife. 
Bored by endless arias, Lady Shaw had taken to peering through her opera glasses to see who else was in attendance that night. Her gaze had lingered on one of the noble boxes longer than the others. When the lights came back up, Lord Shaw’s eyes darted to where his wife had been staring so intently. It was the Pendleton family’s box. Seated alone in a burgundy armchair and nursing a glass of Tyvian wine without a care in the world was Treavor Pendleton. It had to be Treavor, as Morgan and Custis couldn’t be bothered to go anywhere that wasn’t Parliament or the Golden Cat. Lord Shaw, a man descended from generations of soldiers, confronted the cad. Words had been exchanged on the street outside and, according to the looser gossiping tongues in Dunwall, so had blows. 

So Shaw had finally done something about the slander against his name and he had lost. Tragic, but a perfectly normal state of events. Waverly began to feel relieved. Did this mean there was no one following her tonight? 

“And you say this was all done properly?” 

“Oh, yes, your Ladyship. Absolute Gentleman’s Duel, all above-board. They was back to back until the count of three, turned and fired, and Lord Shaw fell. I was one of the seconds.” 

The furious beat of her heart had slowed considerably. A Gentleman’s Duel, if fairly fought, was nothing to be concerned about. And the fact it had been fought on the Boyle estate only served to preserve this party in legend. The headlines of tomorrow’s newspapers were already forming themselves in her mind. ‘Death at Masked Ball’ and ‘Bloody Good Time at Boyle Bash’. 

Of course, it was a shame to lose Montgomery. His wolf mask had been one of the most intriguing of the night. Many of the guests were wearing simple harlequin masks with swatches of color and no real costume element to it. Perhaps the guest list was getting too long.  Perhaps people were getting complacent with their preparations. It was possible that a drastic slashing of the invitees list for the next party would catch their attention. If people weren’t going to take themes seriously, why even bother having them over? 

She interrupted her own thought and looked at the blood pool once more, gesturing to it vaguely. 

“Have someone come to wash this out right away. I don’t want it staining the grass.” 

“Right away, your Ladyship.” 

She turned and walked back up the stone stairs to the house. She sipped her wine again, forcing herself to calm down. Not only had it been a duel, it had been one completely unrelated to the Boyle family. The spirit warmed her veins as she stepped back into the massive dining room. There was nothing to be afraid of. Absolutely nothing. 

The classical music wafted along the halls and the whale statues let out another burst of golden confetti as she entered. Guests milled around the table, filling small plates of food before going off to gossip with one another in the corners. Snippets of conversations danced around her ears as she made her way to the banquet table. 

“—found out he was this close to being a Weeper, so he was disinherited in a flash—” 

“—absolutely burnt to the ground, nothing saved—” 

“—just got sick in the Courtyard—” 

Waverly made her way to the table and selected a chocolate-covered strawberry. She pushed her mask up just a bit to take a bite of the intoxicating sweet. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the syrupy tang of berry juice coupled with the dark richness of the chocolate. She could feel her worries melting away. She had been acting rather a fool, hadn’t she? Nothing could happen to her, especially not in her own home, her castle. 

There was a most uncouth scrape of glass against the wine fountain, followed by the sound of heavy gulping. Waverly sighed and pulled down her mask. Peering around the fountain, she saw exactly what she expected to see. Standing there in the black twin of the Boyle costume was Esma, pouring a goblet of wine down her throat. Worse still, her mask was perched high on her forehead, exposing her entire face. Nervous that someone might see and ruin the evening’s guessing game, Waverly rushed forward and plucked the glass out of Esma’s hand while yanking her mask back down. 

“What in Heaven’s name are you doing—” she hesitated, almost blurting her name out then and there, “Dear Sister?” 

“Whass it look like I’m doin?” Esma slurred, “Was gettin’ m’self a drop.” 

“Well, do leave some for the other guests.” 

Some of the partygoers were starting to look in their direction. Waverly threw an arm around Esma and began steering her towards the powder room. As she pulled her sister down the hall, Esma’s legs tangled and dragged along the floor, nearly taking them both down. Waverly cursed under her breath and hoisted Esma back up. 

“Hold on, left m’drink behind,” Esma murmured pitifully, looking back over her shoulder. 

“I know, I know, but we’ll get you another one.” Waverly bumped the door to the powder room open with her hip. 

The room was empty except for a woman at the vanity, taking eager whiffs of something from within a gilded snuffbox. She was large and squeezed rather unattractively into a white gown that was far too small for her. The feathered hem and the black mask with the orange nose all pointed to her costume being a swan, but she had none of the natural grace or ethereal fragility required to pull it off successfully. 

“Out.” Waverly barked. “Now.” 

The swan-cow nodded and hid the snuff box somewhere in her bountiful décolletage. She rose from the chair and swiftly left the room, shedding feathers behind her. Waverly made a note to find out who the woman was and forbid her from attending any future parties. Corpulence and inattention to style was an unforgivable combination. 
Esma let out another groan. Waverly flung her at the toilet. The black Lady Boyle yanked off her mask just as she began to retch, the sound of sick hitting the porcelain with a nauseating liquid spatter. Waverly reached forward and dragged Esma’s hat and hair out of the way. She closed her eyes and began breathing through her mouth. The smell was already awful. Had Esma eaten anything solid tonight? 

Waverly heard a rattling at the door. The brass knob was turning. Someone was trying to come in. She wedged her foot against the jamb, preventing it from opening further. 

“Occupied,” she called, hoping the person would take the hint. 

“Sister, it’s me,” came a familiar voice. 

It was Lydia. Waverly left Esma slumped at the basin and hurriedly opened the door to let the final Lady Boyle in, affording none of the guests a peek. Lydia was stone sober, a perfect likeness to the crisp whiteness of her costume. Ivory looked at ebony and back. 

“What happened to her?” 

“What do you think?” Waverly was rapidly reaching the end of her rope. Playing hostess was difficult enough, making sure that people weren’t nicking family valuables the moment her back was turned. But playing hostess and nanny? 

Esma gurgled again and leaned forward. Waverly dug her fingers into Esma’s hair and pulled, doing her best not to look. Lydia tilted her head to the side like someone staring at a strange work of art in a museum. 

“Do you think she even tastes it anymore?” she asked. 

“The drink or the sick?” 

“Either.” 

“Fugg you both, ah munna kick yer…” Esma’s insult was interrupted as her body was wracked with more spasms. 

Waverly looked to Lydia. “It’s a good thing she’s wearing the black one. If she was wearing one of ours, the stains would have given her away.” 

Lydia tucked a stray lock of hair back up into her hat. “While we’re on the subject, someone has already guessed who I am.” Her tone was rosy. 

“Oh? Was it Miss White?” 

“No, it was a man, although I wouldn’t be surprised if Miss White had something to do with it. Honestly, the woman has the secret-keeping abilities of an audiograph player. But my gentleman has been whispering honeyed words into my ear all night. Quite refreshing to hear after listening to some of these old geezers. All they do is complain about whale oil quarterly yields or something.” 

“Do we know him?” Waverly deposited Esma in one of the chairs and began dabbing at her face with a towel. 

“I don’t know. He hasn’t told me his name yet.” Lydia’s voice indicated she was entirely fine with her admirer remaining mysterious. 

“Well, how’s he dressed?” 

“I think he’s a skeleton or something. He’s got a black cloak on and some kind of skull mask. I think he might be some version of the Angel of Death.” 

Waverly laughed derisively. “Sounds like you’ve found yourself a real catch, my girl.” 

“And better still, he’s a musician.” Lydia spoke the final word in a dreamy purr. 

“What, a proper one? That’s his profession?” 

Lydia shrugged. “I don’t know. He has at least some musical talent. When I first saw him, he was standing by the harpsichord in the music room. He wasn’t really playing, just letting his fingers tumble over the keys, but it was still wonderful to hear.” 

As happy as Waverly was for her sister, Esma’s situation was more pressing. She had stopped retching for the time being and now she was resting her chin on the edge of the basin. She was taking raspy breaths that caused her to wince and tears trickled their way down her cheeks. 

“Before you dash off to your mysterious musician,” Waverly requested, “Could you have one of the maids come by with some water and a small plate of food? Nothing too heavy, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

Lydia straightened up and adjusted her costume, checking in the mirror to make sure her face was completely covered. She rested her hand on the doorknob and was about to leave when she turned back. 

“Has anyone come close to guessing which is which?” 

Waverly shook her head. “Only a few people have guessed who I am, some have been correct, some have been wrong. None of them seemed sure of themselves. As far as I know, nobody has guessed all three.” 

“Looks like the cameo stays with us.” 

She departed and Waverly locked the door behind her. Esma was spitting into the sink to get the taste out of her mouth. 

“There, there.” Waverly rubbed Esma’s back mechanically and without a trace of sympathy. She reached forward and turned on the faucet, washing away any remnants of the sick. 

The next knock on the door finally came and Waverly opened it to reveal a nervous-looking maid with a tray covered by a silver dome. 

“Hello, milady,” the girl quivered, “I was told that you needed me?” 

“I don’t, she does.” Waverly gestured to Esma’s collapsed form. “Get some food in her and try to get her up to bed without anyone seeing her.” 

“Y-yes, milday.” The maid’s brow furrowed in concern.

Waverly left the servant with the sister and rejoined the party.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1izjn1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1izjn1/dishonored_a_party_to_die_for/,

The stranger had passed on his letter to Camilla and told her the truth about the lies. She was no longer speaking to him and looked at him as if he were lower than a skeever in a buried barrow. Faendal was determined to have his revenge.

And so he was hiding out behind the tanning rack next to Sven’s house (he still lived with his mother, Faendal thought, what sort of man was that!) ready to pounce upon him when he finished his shift at the Inn.

Riverwood was quiet and all the rest of its inhabitants were abed. Faendal was happily imagining all the terrible things he would do to Sven when he heard someone leaving the tavern. It had to Sven, as he could hear such vile singing that the draugr at Bleak Falls would likely be covering their ears.

As Sven got closer and was about to enter the house, Faendal made a dramatic leap over the tanning rack and caught his foot, falling and banging his head on the railing opposite. He lay dazed for a minute before he realised Sven was dragging him up and sitting him on the bench outside the house.

“You all right elf?” he said, sounding strangely concerned.

Faendal’s vision was a little blurry and he felt a trickle of blood on his brow. A mighty ache was starting in his head.

“I feel sick.” He said weakly.

Sven helped Faendal back to the Elf's house and propped him up in his bed. He fussed around finding a clean cloth and dampened it with some rain water. He applied it the wound on Faendal’s forehead. Faendal tried to frown but it just hurt his head more.

“Now don’t go thinking we are friends or what not,” Sven said changing the cloth for a fresh one, “I’m just in a good mood because I had the loveliest chat with Camilla earlier. I’m afraid I think you might be out of the running, friend.” Sven stood up and was humming happily. He started to absent mindedly tidy up Faendal's house.

Faendal felt his heart break a little as he realised it was his own foolish actions that had thrown Camilla into Sven’s arms. It was the end of everything, there would be no more cursing Sven, no more making jokes about Sven’s singing sounding worse than a Horker’s honk, no more stashing dead salmon in Sven’s lute; no more fun.

“I suppose you’ve started planning the wedding?” He asked moodily.

Sven had neatly stacked Faendal's plates and ordered his cheese wheels and was now sitting on the end of his bed polishing his tankards.

“I suppose so,” he said, “I hadn’t really thought what would happen after I got the girl...” he looked thoughtful. “I guess now I won’t have a chance to sing that song I wrote about how a Falmer was paler and better looking than you. And I’d even managed to find a rhyme for Skeever butt.”

“Sounds like it would have been a good one.” Faendal admitted.

“Yes,” Sven said.

Sven stood up and put the tankards away.

Faendal noticed he did not look happy.

“What’s the matter?” he said, “You got what you wanted.”

Sven turned to look at Faendal with his bruised face. His normally tidy white hair was messy and stained with blood. A strange thing was happening in his chest, something that usually only happened when he looked at Camilla.

“Well, I, um. I will miss it.” He said flatly.

“Miss what?” said Faendal, who was feeling more miserable by the moment.

“You know.”

“What?”

“Us.” said Sven.

“Us?”

“Us. The insults. The salmon. That time you piled all the logs outside my door so I couldn’t get out and forgot the door opened inwards. Mother chased you all around Riverwood, remember?”

“I remember.” Faendal said, “She wouldn’t follow me into the river, just stood there cursing. I heard words I’d never heard before.”

Sven smiled. “And when you came out, your trousers were all saggy from the water and you had to hold them up to stop them falling down.”

“You were laughing so hard you fell in the river and that mudcrab got you.”

“Yeah, I still have the scar.” Sven rolled up his sleeve and showed a jagged white mark on his arm. “And you were standing in the river with your pants nearly floating away and you took it out with just one arrow.” He sat back on the bed and looked at Faendal.

“Oh I’d forgotten that.”

“I never said, but I was dead impressed. I could never do that.”

“Oh, that’s not true,” said Faendal patting Sven’s lean, tightly trousered leg, “You’ve got skills. You just need some proper training.” He hesitated, “I could teach you... if you like?”

Sven grabbed Faendal’s hand, “Would you? I mean that would be great!” Suddenly he realised he was holding very tightly to Faendal’s hand. He let it go and tried to nonchalantly brush his hand through his hair.

“Great.” He said, deepening his voice and standing up, “I should get back home, Mother will be worried.” He went to the door. “You’ll be all right now?”

They looked at each other, Sven with one hand on the door. “Because, if you think you might need a hand... if maybe you can’t walk straight... I could stay... you know injuries to the head can be not good... you could fall over... someone should probably stay with you...” he tapped the door as if concerned about its construction. Faendal was smiling broadly.

“I’d like that,” he said, and Sven answered with his own wide smile and went to pour them some ale.

&gt;Me and Faendal are arguing about who should get to date Camilla

&gt;I'm getting desperate, Faendal seems to be spending a lot of time with Camilla

&gt;Some Khajiit comes into town, raving about dragons in Helgen

&gt;Maybe he can help me

&gt;I forge a letter and ask the Khajiit to tell Camilla it's from Faendal

&gt;He gives her the letter and now she won't speak to Faendal again.

&gt;I'm so grateful, I give him some coin

&gt;He asks me to follow him around for a bit

&gt;I oblige

&gt;Why are we going to Bleak Falls Barrow?

&gt;By the Divines! A bandit is chasing us!

&gt;The Khajiit starts beating the bandit to death with his fists

&gt;He takes his iron helmet, his fur armor, and his greatsword and gives them to me

&gt;Holy crap! Two more bandits are chasing us!

&gt;I swing the greatsword

&gt;I just killed him! What do I do!? What do I do!?

&gt;He takes me into the Barrow

&gt;The Khajiit starts punching every single bandit to death while I swing the greatsword in terror.

&gt;Draugr! I'm gonna die... I'm gonna die!

&gt;The Khajiit starts staring at some wall and grabs some tablet

&gt;A Draugr jumps out of a crypt and starts shouting at the Khajiit

&gt;I'm never gonna see Camilla again, am I?

&gt;The Khajiit takes me to Whiterun

&gt;This is nice... No bandits... No draugr

&gt;Sweet, I'm gonna get to see Dragonsreach

It was dark. I couldn't see anything. While I was struggling to regain consciousness I shook my head slowly from left to right and back. Did somebody blind me? Why is it so dark? 

I tried to move forward but suddenly I felt this pulling force that didn't let me go. Sharp cuts that cut into my flesh. I was tied. Tied to a chair as much as I could feel. And I was blindfolded. I looked up and down, slowy gathering air and words to speak. ""Where..."" was the first thing that came form my mouth. I gave it another try ""Where...am I?"" 

I heard a soft chuckle. ""The question is not where, hermano. But why."" 

""Who is this?!"" 

Silence for a few moments.

""Your savior."", replied the voice with some sort of hispanic accent. 

""Why am I here, why am I tied to a chair, why do you hold me captive?"" ""Oh you're free to go"", the voice returned.

I heard his footsteps going behind me. Then a strong grip on my hands followed by a feeling of lightness. He cut my ties. ""Go. Go, motherfucker. If you want to go, go.""

I slowly stood up. I reached for the blindfold and took it off. I turned around carefully and looked in his eyes. These mad brown eyes. The scar above his left eye reached all the way back to the back of his head. He just looked me dead in the eye. No expression. Just serious staring. ""You're free to go, hermano. But mind, the jungle is a fucking hell hole"". ""Who are you"", I asked again. 

He stared at me not saying a word. Suddenly he broke loose ""RUN MOTHERFUCKER! RUN! YOU WANT TO GO! ARE YOU SCARED YOU LITTLE PUSSY?! DO YOU WANT ME TO FEED YOU WITH MY FUCKING CUM HUH?! NEED SOME MOTHERLY JUICE?!""

I stumbled backwards. He quickyl came towards me, pulled a gun out of his pants and pressed it against my head. ""YOU. HAVE. NOT. LIVED. UNTIL YET! You're a tortured soul. But I can help you. Like you I came to this island by accident. I was alone. But as the time went by I learned how to survive."" He chuckled. ""Okay, I was not entirely alone. And actually I've been here for pretty much my entire life. I have a sister. A sister that betrayed me. We will find her. And we will kill her. Hermano. What I expect from you, is loyality. Accept me as your savior. Become part of our brotherhood. And you will never miss a single thing in your life. Besides..."" He giggled uncontrollably. ""...I'm gonna kill you if you don't. But look I chill, okay? I relax, I'm cool. I need you to tell me, what would you feel, if you could kill a human being."" 

He whistled and two men brought him inside. Jeff, my worst enemy. The motherfucker who was responsible for the breakdown of my company back home. He was with me on the boat that got hijacked. 

""See this asshole here,hehe, he said you two know each other. He also said you two aren't such good friends. Isn't that right you chubby bastard?"", he shouted at Jeff while smacking his cheek several times. ""Look, if there is one thing in this world that I have learned then it's this. Hermano, revenge is a solution.""

He pulled out his gun again. He stood beside me, took my hand and put the gun in there. ""What do you feel holding this tool of death in your hand right now?"" I looked down. I never held a gun before. ""W..what do you want me to do?"" He looked me dead in the eye again and pushed his face right in front of mine. I could feel his breath on my face, smell the sweat that was dripping from his head. ""I want you to decide"" he said calmly. ""Decide, what kind of man you want to be. This guy there has had his shot. He decided not to kill anybody. He also is responsible for you being here, no? Didn't he have you go bankrupt and working as a bitch on a boat? you lost family, you lost your money, you lost your home. All that is left, is to take revenge on the man that has caused you all this. Are you willing to restore the balance?"" He slowly moved away from me. 

I was shaking. I pulled up the gun, aimed at Jeff and shot him. Just like that. ""OOOOOH! I can't believe it"", the guy shouted. He laughed. ""Did you see that? Like an ice-cold motherfucking killer."" He sat down next to the liveless Jeff. He chuckled. ""Look at this. In. the. fucking. head. Hermano, you're a psycho."" He laughed again. He stood up and walked over to me. ""Hermano, from today on you're my pupil. I am your savior. i will show you things you've never seen before. Are you ready?""

No sir, I DON'T want to try selling that abomination of yours for more gold than I'll ever own in my lifetime! Who lets a goblin stick helicopter blades into the head of a fallen enemy anyways? Someone is actually going to fly that thing!?

I've been working as a archer for the past eight years and most days follow the same routines. This day has been no exception so far.


I woke up on the afternoon to get ready for my shift. I start my shift at dusk and guard the roofs until dawn. I met my wife, Eleonora, in the kitchen as she cooked dinner for our two sons: Dante and Marco. Dante looks a lot like myself: dark hair, brown eyes and a thin chin. Marco, the younger of the two brothers, has light brown hair, like his mother, and green eyes. Neither my wife nor I has green eyes, which is why I fear that Marco.....isn't mine. I have always been aware of this, from the moment he was born I could tell that something was wrong, and I think Eleonora knows. I've never confronted her about this, I act as if he is my son and do my best to treat him the same as Dante, although it's difficult given what I know. I'm doing everything I can to not think about it, which sometimes only can be done with wine. 


After I had said goodbye to the family, I left to the captain to report for duty. I met the other archers there, and they were all discussing the murder of the Dodge at the carnival and the hooded man that killed him. It wasn't a surprise, everyone is talking about him, it's honestly starting to get boring. However, the hooded killer, Ezio Auditore, is known to kill unsuspecting guards, so I knew this was serious. ""Imagine how much money we would get for catching Auditore!"" one man says while chuckling. Some of the younger guards seem to be serious about the reward, but I know that life isn't that generous. 


After the captain came and ended our conversation to give us the locations of our posts tonight, we all went separate ways. My position tonight is at the northeastern district. This district usually have a lot crimes at night due to the high presence of thieves, so I have to be on my guard.

This is how most days go. If the rest of the night goes as planned, I'll have a calm night, perhaps catch a thief or two, and then return to Eleonora by dawn.  Most say that my days seem dull, but the view of the Venetian rooftops under the midnight stars is what always makes me come back.

It's easy to get lost in your thoughts while admiring the stars. I usually try to use these moments to find it in my heart to forgive Eleonora for not being faithful and giving birth to a bastard. I wish her no harm, I love her, but I feel betrayed. 


It's soon to be dawn, and I can hear something moving behind me. As I turn my neck around to catch the thief, my heart freezes in chock as something is flying towards me. I manage to protect myself in time, and I can now see that the flying one was without a doubt the notorious assassin, Ezio Auditore. I take out my sword, ready to fight, but the stories I've heard of this monster makes my arms weak of fear.  I keep standing in a defensive position, I don't dare to attack him. He taunts me, ""this is a fight, don't be shy!"". I have prepared for a moment like this for eight years, I'm a Venetian guard, I shouldn't have to take this! In rage, I launch my strike, but he quickly evades and grabs me as i trip. He holds me over the roof's edge, and I can see the canal beneath. I can't swim, if he pushes me I will die! I look into his eyes and beg him to let me live. Another archer must have seen us, because I can hear someone behind me saying ""down, or die!"". The assassin looks into my eyes one last time before pushing me off, and I'm falling. 

The impact hurt as I landed on my back, and I'm struggling to survive. Nobody could see me, and the desperate cries for help doesn't help. My sword, my armour, my bow, it's all dragging me down. I take a deep breath, trying to remove all equipment in panic, but in vain.   


I regret that I never confronted my wife about Marco, I wish I had been strong enough to forgive her and leave all of that in the past. I'll never have the chance to so though, now when the last stream of light has been replaced by darkness, the air escapes my lunges and I'm  pulled towards the abyss.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,1373345073.0,,,True,t3_1hw7df,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1hw7df/assassins_creed_ii_the_venetian_rooftops/,

I've spent my whole life living with my pack in the forest, barely hunting enough sheep to by on. The days were hot, the nights were cold, sheep were fast, the rain was wet... Life was rough. At least, it used to be.

See, a few months ago this weird guy showed up. I've seen people sorta like him in some towns a couple biomes over, but they just chase us away. Anyway, this fella shows up out of nowhere one day, and starts chopping down trees. Now we've got no shelter, so we were kinda mad. But he was big and scary, and if those guys from town were anything to learn from, he's got a giant robot hiding somewhere that will pop up out of nowhere and rip us a new one. So, we just sit back and let him do his thing.

Eventually he gets enough wood, and starts building a house. It's not the best thing in the world, but it's nothing to laugh at either. it's got two floors, and looks really cozy. I wanna go see what it's like inside, but my brothers keep telling me that he's dangerous, and he would kill me if I got too close to his sheep. I'm the cautious type, so I listened and stood my distance.

Over the days he's done some impressive work. He went into this hole in the ground near our pack, and when he came out he had a huge bag overflowing with strange rocks. He took them into his house, then came out an hour later with a full set of armor and a sharp sword. He planted a few seeds near a pond, then saw us and started running over. We were scared, but brave. All our strongest males got in defensive position, and prepared for the worst.

But, for some odd reason, he didn't attack. He put away his sword, pulled out some delicious-looking bones, and put them in a pile in front of us, then walked away. We were a bit skeptical at first, but after tasting them, they were delicious. We needed more, but were still too scared to approach him.

The same thing happened for the next couple of days. He would go into the hole for a while, bring his rocks into his house, and give us bones. Eventually, we warmed up to him and welcomed him into our pack with open front legs. He came to us, strapped a grey band around out necks, and gave us each respective ""names"". He told us to follow him to his house, and build us a shack to keep us sheltered. It was way better than the trees were, and he used a soft wool for the floor that made for comfy sleep. He told us to stay here and rest, and to prepare for the night.

We stayed there, we didn't dare disobey him. As nice as he was, he still had a big sword and it's better to be safe than sorry.

That night, though, he left his house and told us to follow him. He took us all to the desert, where we we've never been. We've heard stories from other passing packs about monsters in the desert. Scary, green monsters that eat anything that moves. Giant spiders. Walking skeletons, avenging their delicious brethren. Tall, dark glowing men who move faster than anything we could ever imagine. They were all true.

After a vicious night of fighting, we were all mortally wounded. We were gonners.

However, he took us back home, gave us all a steak dinner, and told us to rest.

This went on every night for about a week, each time he nursed us back to health no matter how deep our cuts. Though we were once scared of him, we gradually became a vicious team. We learned to look out for one another, and Master even got better equipment.

He would have us attack anything in sight, but the big tall guys were our main target. Master got so excited when they popped up, he would have us chase him down and always fought extra-hard to beat them. When we finally killed them, he would congratulate all of us on our hard work and gave us a round of steaks.

Eventually, he said that he had enough ""pearls"". He sprinkled an odd powder on them, and they went flying away. He said, ""stay here, I'll be back soon"", and then went off chasing the pearls.

That was two months ago. We haven't seen him since.

His crops have grown and withered, his cattle have escaped their pens and fled, and some of my pack are starting to doubt master's return. We've had to survive we hunting sheep again, though one of us have managed to get into Master's box and fetch some old rotten meat. That has fed us for a while, but we're running out.

Everyone is doubting his return, and some of us are preparing to leave.

But not me.

I know Master will return, just like he said he would.

Everything was going good so far. I just had a kid with my beautiful wife, we've just finished up on our church, my friend John got to become the priest, and Douglas, our protective iron golem, had just stopped yet another zombie seige all by himself, with no fatalities. Life was going perfectly, until he discovered us.

The sun just started to rise, burning some of the zombies that were trying to turn us. Everything started to run normally, just like any other day, until we spotted a man, in his 20s or 30s, looking at the village from over the cliff. We had no idea why he was here, so we decided to gather our goods, in hopes that he had emeralds that we could get from him by a little bargaining.

He arrives at the village, and he has tons of emeralds, 7 stacks of 64 if I remember correctly, and he immediately began trading with us. We bargained with this mysterious man for quite a bit, and it was all going good, until Smitty, the town idiot, decided to come along. Smitty wanted 10 emeralds in exchange for... a loaf of bread. The man then stood there for a bit, and got a glowing Diamond Sword out, and he hit Smitty down to the ground, ablaze, with one slice to his head.

Douglas immediately noticed, and he headed straight toward the man to take him down. The man then swiftly equips a set of glowing diamond armor, and he takes Douglas down immediately, not getting hurt much in the process. We then begin to heighten our bargains, hoping to stop him. He just ignores us and pillaged our homes, taking bookshelves, the blacksmith's anvil and cages, and he destroys out homes with his fists to collect the wood from some of the homes.

As it starts to get late, I rush into my home, because I know that a zombie siege is coming tonight. With Douglas dead, we prepare for our unavoidable deaths. The man then replaces our wooden door with an iron one, making us think that he has mercy, but he just uses it for his plan. He then makes a bunch of TNT,  surrounding the rest of the village with it. As the zombies start to come, he then takes his armor off and drinks some kind of invisibility surum, lights the TNT on fire, and goes on his way.

fast forward a couple weeks, we were supposed to go on a majour excavation of Saarthal and that dunmer, and while me and my two other colleagues found essentially nothing of importance (more nedic pots essentially), he found a majour find. i was jealous, only a few weeks in, and skipping all the major lessons this slacker found a giant blue glowing orb! it was then that i decided to really pick up on my alteration studies, it was hard enough trying to keep up with J'zargo. with family pressure on being my best i started feeling really stressed

after another week he had come over to the entrance way to my room in the dorm. leaning against the wall he smiled and said hello to me. he was really friendly, but that bit of jealously inside of me wanted to really come out. he asked what was wrong and i told him i was having trouble with my transformation spells. he said he'd help. finally a break. so i pretended to turn him into a cow, a horse, a dog, etc. and as a final joke i made him see everything in green. all this time he was smiling, nodding understandingly and patiently.. i thought to myself ""oh wow...now i feel bad"" and i decided to give him a small enchanted amulet i made the day before.

he started getting a bit dizzy and so he ended up sleeping for 24 hours in his room. during this time i sat beside his bed making sure he was fine. during this time i couldn't help but feel really bad, i really wanted to make it up to him, but i really didn't know how. i've always just been a bookworm and inexperienced with a lot of things. when he woke up, he asked if i wanted to go with him on adventure. i nodded and so we up and left.

he took me into a dwemer ruin, and together we walked throughout skyrim admiring the beauty around us. i noticed his growth in illusion and conjuration magic, and admired his genius in restoration. he forged me a powerful avkiviri-styled blade and i was with him when he bought a house in Solitude. we shared so many experiences together in just those two months, i felt overwhelmed, the more i looked at his strong-reliable-back, and his calming demeanor the more my heart tugged within me.

after doing a pilgrimage for our lady Azura, he slipped on an amulet of Mara and took me by the hand. he asked me to marry him. i said yes. he filled the basement with multiple rare alchemical ingredients and books of metaphysics and powerful spells lining our house and would spend a day with me collecting flowers. he brought back good food and wine and we spent a lovely honeymoon week.

i met my new best friend Jordis who was his appointed housecarl. it was odd at first having a woman in the house but she was very strong and kind. we got along very well despite our different interests. it was around this time that he stopped bringing me along on adventures. i was fine with this because i knew our advenutres had to come to a halt. he was a Hlaalu and i'm of house Telvanni. i was just hoping that no one from back home would catch onto our marriage. and so i continued to study in our mansion. he would be gone for a few days at a time then take me out for dinner, we would spend the night together and he would go onto another business trip.

...when the vampire attacks started he came to me one night and gave me an armored robe, and sharpened my sword. he also outfitted jordis with powerful gear and told me to never venture outside alone and that he would be back one day. for a full two months he was gone, no word from him and when he came back there was a beautiful woman standing right beside him. he was dressed in full vardenfell styled glass armor and stared right through me with a distant stare. the girl beside him simply waved at me and smiled and then grabbed a book from the shelf and sat down at the dinner table without even talking to anyone. when the two interacted they seemed close, and spoke secretive as if something only they would know.

i took my husband by the hand and led him to the bedroom and he put his armor away. i comforted him that night but he still never talks about what happened to me. he disappeared again the next morning while i was still asleep. for three weeks i once again never heard from him. one night he slipped into our bed room and sat at the desk. i woke up and i was surpised to see him. he asked for some food so i cooked him something and then told me to follow him.

we were on the road for a day and when we passed a great lake he showed me a beautiful mansion on the the hill, a great library, multiple bedrooms and plenty of storage space. i was  astonished. he seemed to be lively again but when i walked in there was two more women, and two children. he had adopted children without telling me, and i still don't know the relationship he had with the two women. 

one told me that she was the steward of the place and she was recuited after sharing a drink and a brawl with my husband. the other was his housecarl that was  given to him by the jarl. i really didn't know what to think. so when he asked if i could move in with him here, i simply couldn't reply.  after asking me 3 or for more times after, and when he hinted that we should part all i could say was ""you'll be alright on your own?...i'll see you back at the college""

he still comes by every week to visit me...but i really don't know what to do...he's not the same happy, man i used to know. he's changed quite a bit. and it seems like he doesn't want to share anything. and i'm sure he slept with at least 1 of those other women but i have no proof. i think i'll focus on my studies...the more i think about this the more lost, confused, and hurt i am...

I hear one of my workers telling him if he is looking for work, he can work at the mines. So I see the guy running inside. I shrug about it, being little concerned, I continued smelting the ore. In matter of minutes, the guy comes out of my mine. He approaches me, and as my husband has nuts the size of little snowberries. I brag about my mine: ""I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."" I told him. He just looks at me with this blank stare, and replies ""I have some ore to sell."" And the guy sells me what, few chunks of ore. I didn't pay the fool much, of course. Next thing the idiot does is throwing few amethysts to the ground. Before I manage to pick them up, the guy stacks them. So, there I see an pillar of amethysts, undoubtedly from my mine. But in confusion, all I can do is stare at what he's doing. The next thing blew me off completely. He shouted, and the amethysts flew over the town to the sea. I drop my jaw, the guy turns at me, then he sprints and bumps at me. I tell the guy to watch what he's doing, but he ignores me. Just runs away from the town. After such incident, I had to check what he did at my mine. I enter the mine, only to see every single ore vein depleted, all of them, years of work, and the guy had busted through all the veins, shattering the precious ore and rock, only to manage to harvest few chunks of ore. Not only that, all my workers have been gathered to a pile of naked corpses, and on top of them, there's approximately dozens, if not hundreds of cabbages.

I see many minigunners in the group and a couple of granadiers. I figure they'll help us take out the heavier stuff so it might be a good idea to line up closer to them.

We get out first orders and head out passed the guard towers in hope of finding more tiberium to replenish our supplies at the base. The last tiberium harvester from our old field comes barrelling towards us as if he's not paying attention behind the wheel, the rest of the squad just casually runs passed it as if it weren't there, my heart pounding thinking this is the end when suddenly he stops and allows us to run passed. This doesn't seem like the most organised way to do things but I guess if it works.

After about 2 minutes of running into the black clouds that lie on the horizon we come across some rocketeers and minigunners, the squad gets in close and begins the assault. We were going quite well have the advantage in this situation with them firing behind us due to their weapons not being so accurate.. when suddenly the granadiers get involved and I swear to fucking christ those guys never received any training with the first volley of grenades took out half our squad, luckily after a few more volleys the finally take out the rocketeers. What the fuck army am I in?

We continue wandering wounded into the black clouds when we finally come across some tiberium. We decide to scout the whole plantation out to measure roughly how much there would be when I see a soldier willingly run across it as if he were immune. I begin yelling at him to get the fuck out but he just doesn't listen and casually runs along the tiberium field around the edge. Seconds later he collapses and the screams he made will haunt me the rest of my life. The rest of the squad merely ignores it and continues measuring out the field.

Once we finished measuring it out, we called in our tiberium harvesters to begin so we can finally get some more supplies back at base. While we wait we're just casually standing just on the outskirts of the tiberium. We see a harvester come from just over the hill, it seems different to me but nobody else seems to notice. Once again it come hurdling towards us but after our previous encounter with them, I'm not too worried. We stand around knowing that the driver will be able to get around us easily, it comes screaming closer but it's cool.. those guys are just like that. I guess even though they're in the cabins, the gasses of the tiberium must make them crazy wired or something. I turn to talk to a colleague when he tells me the he's nervous about how close the harvester is and I begin to calm him, bringing up the story of the harvester earli...

That retard cheated or something and my TOTALLY AWESOME RATATTA got pretty beaten up. Yeah, we would've nailed that kid if he hadn't started throwin' sand in my TOTALLY AWESOME RATATTA's face.

Yeah, so out of the corner of my eye I saw this other guy coming up. He was wearing his cap back-to-front and he had this little blue dinosaur with him. He challenged me, and I was like ""I just lost, so I'm trying to find more Pokémon. Wait! You look weak! Come on, let's battle!""  Maaan, remind me not to mess with little blue dinosaurs again. Those guys are the worst. They're literally the AT&amp;T's of Pokemon.

So, like, I told that guy that my TOTALLY AWESOME RATATTA was in the top percentage of Ratatta's. Pretty sure he remembered it. There was just something about the way he wore his hat, too... I'm sure he gets all the girls. I gave him my number. Hope he picked up on the hint.

So, yeah, over the next few days I kept on and on calling him and telling him about stuff my TOTALLY AWESOME RATATTA did. I think he didn't really get the hint though, cause he wouldn't say a thing. Not a goddamn thing. Come to think of it, I don't think he's **ever** said anything. This stuff's weird, man.

So ,like, I called him a couple days back. My TOTALLY AWESOME RATATTA which had been in the top percentage of Ratatta was now a TOTALLY AWESOME RATICATE in the top percentage of all Raticate. I made it pretty clear I meant to pound him in battle. Made sure he knew what he was walking into.

Told him, ""Let's get together and battle! I promise things will be different! Route 30's where I'll be. Give me a shout when you come. All right. Later!""

Yeah man, I was ready. My Raticate knew Hyper Fang and I wasn't too bad in the biting department myself. I put in my breeziest pair of shorts (You guys should always wear shorts, they're nice and comfy), and that guy showed up, flying on this massive bird thing.

He didn't have his little blue dino anymore, from what I could tell. He had a big blue dino, though, although he didn't use it. My TOTALLY AWESOME RATICATE was just waiting to battle. That guy sent out this weird looking Poke-MAN with 4 arms. That guy looked crazy, man. He had totally rad hair though. Nice muscles too... I wonder what they felt like...

Yeah, so Raticate pulled a Super Fang on that noob and downed him to half hp. I was like 'HELL YEAH', but then that sucker turned 'round and Cross Chopped Raticate into oblivion.

We've been trainin' loads since then. My TOTALLY AWESOME RATICATE is ready for a rematch. Whenever I close my eyes, all I can see are his well-tanned le- HIS POKEBALLS. ...Dammit, that didn't come out right.

It's official. There’s a new bard in town and I'm no longer the youngest at the college. Aia informed me of this over breakfast, chuckling gleefully and noting that I'd have to come up with a new 'opening line'.  ""Come Ataf,” she said. “You didn't think you'd be the youngest forever, did you?""  
Well of course I didn't, but I had hoped to milk it for a bit longer.  
Anyway, afterwards she tripped over her skirt going up the stairs to flute class and broke her toe. I laughed myself sick.

**4th of Sun's Dawn**  
That's it. Illdi has taken up with the new recruit. She rejected me last year because she said I was too young, and now she's making the beast with two backs with some upstart two years my junior, just because he found some manky old drum in a cave. I intend to confront her this very evening. I mean come on; does he even lute?  
**Addendum:** Well, apparently he *does* lute. And he's got ever so many skills and a way with the 'dragon tongue', whatever that means. I didn't ask; it sounds rude, and I blush easily. Anyway, she said she likes me just fine, but she just doesn’t see me that way, and she doesn’t want to lose me as a friend, etcetera, etcetera. How humiliating. 

**6th of Sun’s Dawn**  
I've decided it's time I get out and see the province for myself. I can come back finish my studies next year, and by then I'll have so much more to contribute, what with all my worldly experiences. I will travel the breadth of the land, documenting the stories and songs of the ragged folk. I'm going to live amongst them on the streets (if it’s not too cold; elsewise I shall of course patronise an inn), share their bread and wine (maybe not their wine; that cheap stuff makes me sick) and record their tales. I shall prove to Illdi that I am a true bard and a real man, whence she must surely renounce the pipsqueak, and finally be mine.

**10th of Sun's Dawn**  
Today I leave! I shall write more upon embarking. 

**11th of Sun's Dawn**  
Well, I *almost* left. When I got to the stables, Thaer was dead drunk in the back of his own carriage again, and the guards wouldn't let us leave until he’d sobered up. I am not entirely convinced of his sobriety even now, but as I write day is breaking and we leave Katla's Farm behind in the glorious orange glow of dawn. At last I am on my way – there is no turning back now!  
**Addendum**: In fact we did turn back, as Thaer realised he'd forgotten his lucky shovel. Gods, I am at the mercy of a drunken halfwit. 

**12th of Sun's Dawn**  
Just watched Thaer kill a wolf with his lucky shovel. As I write this, he's skinning it and wittering about it fetching a pretty penny in Windhelm. Now he’s started pulling jewellery out of its intestines. I think perhaps I shall forgo the stew he is offering to make. I shall break into my cheese wheel instead.

**14th of Sun’s Dawn**  
Bard’s greetings from Windhelm!
I had intended to update this journal every day, but it’s been far too cold to write from the back of the carriage. Besides, Thaer never lets me get a moment’s peace save for the blessed hours he spends asleep at the reins. Were it not for our sturdy Nord mounts knowing the landscape as well as (in fact I’d wager better than) Thaer himself, I’m convinced we should be resting at the bottom of a ravine by now.  
I must confess that, as beautiful as Skyrim is (and I knew it would be), I fear that some of the romance has been tainted for me by virtue of being forced to sit for two days in the lee of the most flatulent man on Nirn. The unfortunate condition of his bowels I can only attribute to his appalling diet, seeming chiefly to consist of dried horker strips (chewy, fatty, vile), jellied slaughterfish (where to begin) and Alto wine.  
He is gone now, thank the Nine (note: I must remember to say Nine here for fear of losing teeth in a brawl) and I am safely installed in a room at Candlehearth Hall. Tomorrow I shall venture out into the city to get a taste of the *real* Windhelm, perhaps even share a song or two with the locals!  
Now I must away and quietly procure myself a jug of warm milk. The journey has upset my stomach terribly; doing one’s business in the woods is most undignified not to mention mortally dangerous should one encounter a bear doing the same.

At the start, it was only me and Stella, but eventually we got a couple more guys to join and in a few years we were making some serious caps. Now, we aren't as big as Crimson Caravan, but I'd like to think that we're every bit as good. Things were going great for our little company; we had the customers and they had the caps. That is, until we lost the Salt Lake City run to the raiders. Now I'm stuck in a position I would have never thought I would be in: Establish a new route to New Canaan or sell the business I've worked so hard for. I have this idea in my head, a route to New Canaan that passes through Zion. Being the first outsiders into Zion since the bombs fell could turn out to be pretty damn profitable, but on the other hand it could backfire and then we'd all end up dead. I hate to put Stella in harms's way, but this is a risk that we have to take. I put out a radio broadcast around New Vegas for some able-bodied travelers to act as security, but I have no idea who or what will show up to answer my message. Hopefully we get some real help this time, unlike those kids we hired back in New Reno. We almost lost the entire little loop because of those bastards. Either way, I have to get ready for the task at hand and not get hung up on the past. Stella and I are waiting up at the northern passage for people to answer our call, and I have to put on a brave face for the new recruits. On the inside, I'm nervous, hell, I'm downright terrified of the implications of this trip failing. But I know that there are slightly-less irradiated pastures on the other side, so here's hoping for Happy Trails through Zion.

Her armor was made of white sloping plates and her head was covered with an ancient black hood, complete with an obsidian mask!
As the warm coin was placed in my palm, the cold black face made me flinch back and almost fall off the bench. I recovered, and repeated the Beggar's Praye just as Brenuin taught me.
""Oh! Thank you... Divines bless your warm soul!""
The lady, noticing  my shock pulled off the mask and it vanished into thin air. To my surprise, my new hero was an Orc woman. She was actually quite pretty, with only two small canines jutting up when she smiled. Her hair was pulled back and her skin was almost more bronze than green.
""It actually goes, 'bless your kind heart'. My cousin taught it to me when I was about your age. Now, what's your name?"" she said in a soft, warm voice.
""Lucia,"" I stammered in awe. THIS lady was an orphan like me?! I couldn't believe it!
""That's a beautiful name! Mine is Mauni-Ka,"" she sat down next to me, ""Now, if you don't mind me asking, why are you out here begging?""
My eyes began to water right away. ""It's... It's what Brenuin said I should do. He's the only one that's been nice to me since... since Mama..."" At that, my inner strength left me and I began to cry tears that I thought had drained away weeks ago. For the first time, however, I felt arms wrap around me and pull me close. After I was able to pull myself back together, I continued my story. ""Anyways, my Aunt and Uncle took over our farm and threw me out. Said I wasn't good for anything, so I wound up here. But... I... I don't know what to do! I miss her so much..."" I looked up, and saw a tear streaking Mauni-Ka's face.
""There there, little one. Don't cry! I know what it's like to feel lonely... Lately, that's seemed to be all I know,"" with that, she stood up and reached out her hand, ""But how about we fix that?""
I stared at her, dumbfounded. ""You mean... you want to adopt me?""
She smiled wide, ""If you want! I have this big house north of Falkreath, and Aela gets bored with only a Bard to keep her company! Plus, a child should never have to sleep behind an inn. So, what do you say... daughter?""

    I now have time to tell you what I had seen that changed my world. We finally made our way to Dawnguard. Finding the treasure proved to be a challenge, for they were scattered all across their dwelling. Having the place stink of those scum didn't help either. We had to make camp inside, for the snow had picked up again. We built a fire in the dinning hall, because there were no beds, only coffins. I’d rather sleep on the floor, wrapped in troll intestines than in a coffin. As I said, we decided to build a fire in the dinning hall and make some food as our bodies grew hungry from our travels. We were reminiscing old adventures when I found a book next to a clan member’s chair. The velvet book had a splash of blood on the bottom corner and it had a strange vibration to it. I began to read it and I had found something incredible. The vampires, they where trying to open a doorway from “another world; a world that sat next to ours.” Then the book went on to talk about a man born from a dragon. I knew this was going be good, so I started to read it out loud to my thane. The book was in elvish, but I tried my best to translate.    
     “The moon will turn to ash        
      The spirit of our master will shine through the riptide    
      The world-walker is born with a dragon heart     
      What does it mean to have honor    
      When the earth is set ablaze"" I couldn’t help but laugh.     
      “What do you think these vampires were drinking? It wasn’t blood!” My thane grinned as he took another bite out of his skeever cake. The book started to vibrate even stronger the further we ate into our feast. Then a high pitched sound coursed through the castle. We had no idea where to give attention as we looked towards every inch of the hall. A blinding light tore through the air, causing us to stand to our defenses. Thats when “he” walked out. He had long hair with a scar down his face. He dropped to the floor and I could finally see that his armor was made from the bones of a dragon. *This must be what they were trying to conjure up,* I thought as I took my defensive position.
      The man turned and stared down my thane. He walked towards him and extended his palms outwards to conjure two swords. I ran to give the armored man a taste of my Nord steel, but he was quite swift. He vanished right before me as I tried to make contact with my axe. A crushing foose was then laid upon my unaware body. The cracking of my ribs erupted from my armor as I hit the ground. Blood then greeted my mouth while I curled up in pain. Thats when my thane foosed him back, but he absorbed the mighty blow and slide across the floor without loosing his stance. The dust shot out from beneath his feet as he sprinted after my thane with a fury we had never seen. As I laid before their battle, I realized that some poison arrows would remedy our situation.
      My thane readied his shield and sword, but the armored man displayed a strength unknown to our eyes. He took the shield from my thane as if it was his lunch money and smashed it across is face. I had to make haste, for I knew he was in trouble. I dipped the arrows in the poison and ran across the room to retrieve my bow. The armored man grabbed my stunned thane, picked him up by the shoulder, and drove his sword into his body. My thane screamed in agony, causing my heart to skip. I couldn’t bare to see him in this much pain, diary. So, I laid a couple of arrows into the armored man’s back. Thats when my thane set him ablaze with his thume. The armored man dropped the Dragonborn and tried to brush out the fire off his armor, but the poison was starting to act. He had to run outside to extinguish the flames, which gave us time to recuperate. I grabbed my thane and we tried our luck in the elements. I could see smoke brewing outside where the armored man had jumped in a near by lake. We made our way opposite of him.
    We used up the last of our potions on our last endeavor, so I tired my best to patch him back up as we took a break from retreating. The trip back to Riften is a long one, so I am letting him rest for now as I keep watch. I believe we are safe for now, because I have some invisibility potions from one of our last treks to Riften. The pain in my lower chest is quite painful now, but there is no time for pain.    
    I will write again when we are safe.

1372125622.0,37,self.LifeasanNPC,1h0dq1,(Skyrim): My Brother in Law: Part I,civaddicted,52,15,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1h0dq1/skyrim_my_brother_in_law_part_i/,"In my life, I've found Fate has always had a twisted sense of humour. Who would've thought a war of such destruction could bring so much gain?

The legionnaires marching north were always eager to loosen their purses on some trinket or another, especially with Camilla here now. Soldiers were always willing to spend a few coins more with Camilla than I, hoping to get in her pants no doubt, but still a profitable turn of events. It's strange how profitable business always seems to create the most unusual of circumstances. 

And it is through an unusual business transaction that I found a brother in law. I'll never forget the first few times we met. He came running into town with Hadvar, Alvar the blacksmith's nephew. I was watching them out the window but lost sight of him when Camilla distracted me, yapping on again about that damned golden claw.

He came into the store as I was ending her rant and I apologised to him for seeing the tiff. He shrugged telling me not to worry about it, asking if I was interested in a few bits and bobs he had for sale which, he said, he ""found"".

Opening his bag, he laughed ""Don't worry about that blood, bit of warm water and a good scrub will have em looking good as new."". He took out enough hardware equip a battle group, topping it off with a dozen or so animal pelts. The blood still dripped warm. I bought it all for a small fee, knowing my contact in the stormcloak rebellion would gladly pay to have their supplies returned and the furs would do nicely for a new throw blanket for these cold winters.

I knew better than to ask where he ""found"" the armaments and didn't particularly care how he came about the skins. Gold in hand, he turned to Camilla and handed her a letter he said a local man,  Sven, asked him to give to her. I don't know what that testosterone deficient runt wrote her but it rubbed Camilla up the wrong way.

They chat for a while and now he's all ears for the golden claw, from the look in his eyes I can tell he's not even listening, no, he's dreaming that if he can find it, Camilla would let him store his mage's staff in her master chest in gratitude!

Camilla offered to show him how to find the thieves lair but he declined, saying he couldn't go right now as he had "" an urgent meeting with the Jarl of Whiterun"", I nearly snorted when I heard this. When I was a boy, my father used a similar line when asked where he was sneaking off to drink at night, he would tell us he had ""business with the emperor"".

After he left I saw him ""rush off"" to his meeting with the Jarl. Obviously he first had to hold council with those sages of the nation, Faendal and Alvar. He spent a few hours working Alvar's forge learning how to make armour and weapons then after he had Faendal give him free archery lessons, I overheard him convince Faendal that if he came with him to find the golden claw, Camilla would see Faendal in a new light, especially since Sven was now out of the picture. It wasn't until that evening that it clicked what those two had schemed with the fake letter from Sven, I ,however, didn't rush to tell Camilla. As soon as Sven's bitch mother bit the dust he would've been clawing at Camilla's breeches. That Faendal on the other hand, would be afraid of Camilla saying no even if she were dead!

When he eventually left I thought that would be the last I ever saw of either him or Faendal, let alone the golden claw, but Fate again, had other designs. 

A few weeks later Faendal returned to Riverwood, he visited the shop more frequently than ever, often just lingering, desiring an ""unexpected"" rendezvous with Camilla. He said they never managed to make that important meeting with the Jarl but instead went to Riften and Falkreath before Faendal was told to come back to Riverwood. 

I had all but forgot about this odd man and his promise to return the golden claw until a few months later, in he walks. I was in the process of informing Camilla that the ""sophisticated"" citizens of Riverwood would not care for silver buckles or oddments from the Summerset Isles and he interrupts saying that they would really brighten the shop, all the while beaming at Camilla. 

Camilla, encouraged by his support, began talking with him of his travels. As he spoke of his adventures he began gathering a bouquet of flowers which he took carefully from his pack. Each flower had a different story which he told as he weaved this floral assemblage. I was certain he was going to give Camilla the bouquet as a gift when suddenly, as he wove his last stem, he proceeded to place the entire bouquet into his mouth and eat it. He spoke through petals and stems telling us, in complete seriousness, ""this is how the best alchemists in the world learn their craft""

He introduced his business partner Jenassa, he said they met in Whiterun. I asked if he ever got around to that important meeting with the Jarl and he asked which one! I jokingly asked how many of the Jarls he was currently acquainted with and if he could put in a good word for me with the new high king!

He said he had become a thane of the Jarls of Whiterun, Falkreath and Riften and knew the Jarls quite well, he said in fact the reason he was in Riverwood was because he had decided to set up home in Falkreath in a lakeside manor and was in search of lumber to construct his abode.

Waverly left the servant with the sister and rejoined the party.  With the Esma situation now in hand, she was free to take up her responsibilities as hostess again, namely taunting her guests over their inferior wealth or their inability to complete the guessing game.

Hours later, the dining room was temporarily cleared and the guests mingled over cocktails in the games room.  It wasn’t long before one of the guards entered the room and politely informed everyone that the dining room had been converted into a ballroom and that there would be dancing until the unmasking at midnight.

The regal lords and ladies bustled back into the immense space.  The long table was gone, as were the piles of food, all replaced by a small cluster of musicians that had taken up residence in the corner.  A self-important little conductor stood at his podium and rapped his baton several times.  Bows to violins and cellos were raised and frozen as the musicians waited for permission from their leader.  With a stiff and emphatic gesture, the band launched into a Serkonian waltz, upbeat yet refined.

“I would say you look ravishing tonight, Waverly,” a familiar voice pestered her ear, “But you’re dressed exactly the same as your sisters.”

She turned and faced the man in the whale mask.  She’d know that irritating jabber anywhere, even if it was echoing within the hollow confines of a party costume.

“Congratulations, Ramsey, you've got one out of three.  You have achieved an equal aptitude at mathematics as a child.”  She tilted her head to the side and chuckled.  “But my dear, didn’t the invitation make it clear tonight is a costume party?”

“Hysterical as ever.  Shall we dance?”

He pulled her onto the floor before she could speak.  She nearly stumbled as they joined the whirling couples laughing to one another.  One of his hands rested itself on her waist with a familiarity she felt he did not deserve.

“Is there something I can do for you, Ramsey, or are you just bothering me for fun?”

“I wanted to talk to you.”

“I was afraid of that.”

“Just listen to me!”  He snapped.  As quickly as his tone had become acidic, it was now saccharinely sweet.  “I wanted to discuss our…financial arrangement.”

“You mean you’ve finally decided to sell me Harkraven Hall?  I’m glad to hear it.  That would pay off a significant part of your debt, wouldn’t it?”

The music changed.  Ramsey bristled visibly at the mention of his ancestral home.  Of all the properties and assets he’d been selling her, Harkraven was the one thing he’d been adamant about keeping to himself.  This didn’t make him any better at handling money, though.  If things went her way, Harkraven would be hers by the Month of Harvest.

“Actually, I was hoping for…a reprieve of sorts.  Just until I get things sorted out”

“Oh, I do like a good joke, Ramsey.  Now tell me another one.”
She intentionally stepped on his foot just to throw him further off-balance.  Ramsey winced.

“I’m serious, Waverly.”  He may have been serious, but the tremble in his voice was getting more and more pronounced.  “I’m on the verge of something big with Rothwild.  The word is his business is going sour.”

“Much like my evening.”  She pushed him away and glanced at her watch.  “So sorry to cut this short, Rams darling, but it’s almost midnight.”

Ramsey’s shoulders slumped in disappointment.  Something in Waverly bristled.  A real man would’ve taken this sort of ribbing in stride.  It was his own fault he was in any sort of financial predicament.  But this exhibition of weakness, this willingness to roll over truly disgusted her.  She stepped close to him and leaned in.

“You’ll raise the funds you owe me, Ramsey, or Harkraven will be nevermore.”

If she had been able to see his face, that would have been the ultimate delight.  She imagined his eyes widening and his cheeks flushing.

“You’re a viper, Waverly.  And I hope you choke on your own venom.”

He spun around on his heel and marched out of the room.  Waverly edged her way out of the dancing couples.  There were only fifteen minutes before the unmasking.  A maid with an empty tray caught her eye.  Waverly rushed over and clutched the girl’s arm.

“You there, you’re the one who took Esma up to her room, right?”

The girl’s eyes widened in fear.  “Yes, milady.”

“Good.  Bring her back down again.  Make sure she’s sober enough for the unmasking.  Have you seen Lydia?”

Wincing under her mistress’ tight grip, the maid only managed to shake her head.

“Well, then keep an eye out for her.  She might be with the Angel of Death.”

If possible, the girl’s eyes got even wider.  She scurried off in the direction of the back stairs, the easiest way to get to Esma’s room.

Waverly glanced in a few doors, looking for the telltale white of Lydia’s costume.  She never got to see this strange man.  He must have been quite the charmer to reign in Lydia so quickly.  She kept glancing at her watch, growing more and more frustrated.  There wasn’t enough time to comb every corner of the Manor.  She would have to return to the dining room.  Hopefully Lydia would remember her important task and join them.  Otherwise the unmaksing would be quite spoiled.

With just moments to midnight, Esma was brought downstairs.  Her costume was clean and there was no trace she had been sick earlier that night.  She shoved the guard following her away and took her spot by the fireplace.

It was supposed to be a simple thing.  The three of them stood at strategic points in the room, surrounding their adoring public.  Waverly stood at the doors to the garden, Esma at the fireplace, and Lydia at the doorway to the dining room.  They would make a speech in unison, either praising a lucky winner and presenting them with the valuable Boyle cameo, or chastising their guests for their failure.  There was no winner.

Waverly stole one last peek at the grandfather clock.  It was time, whether they had Lydia or not.  She looked at Esma, who nodded.  Waverly looked at the doors to the dining room.  Empty.  No Lydia.  Further along the hallway, she could see the maidservant fruitlessly scurrying from door to door with an increasing panic.  Waverly took a breath and folded her hands behind her back, the signal that the rhyme was about to begin.  She spoke on the first chime of midnight.

*“We the Boyle sisters three*

*Extend you every courtesy.*

*Our food you eat, our wine you drink,*

*But have you stopped to have a think?*

*Each one of us has donned a mask*

*And given you a simple task.*

*Discover our identities*

*And do it with the greatest ease.*

*But since nobody on this night*

*Has gotten any answer right,*

*The masks come off, and none too soon.*

*Now who is who in this grand room?”*

In perfect unison and just in time with the final chime of twelve, Waverly and Esma untied the ribbons holding their masks and removed them.  There was an appreciative burst of glee from the audience and some scattered applause, many people removing their own masks.  Waverly plastered on her best socialite smile.

“Thank you, my darlings.  It was a good game, wasn’t it?  And now, we dance!”

The musicians raised their instruments and began playing a dignified Dunwall classic.  Partners found each other again and resumed dancing.  It was short-lived, however.

A blood-curdling shriek echoed throughout the halls.  Everyone stopped and looked around.  Waverly saw the door to the music room open.  The maidservant, her face as pale as her apron, dashed down the hall like all of hell was behind her.  Something began sinking in Waverly’s stomach.

*No…*

Tossing her mask to the ground, Waverly sprinted to the music room, throwing open the door.  Her heart stopped when she saw a white boot sticking out the harpsichord.

  So Samantha and I left camp at 10 and we headed down to the crimson caravan company to trade supplies and check for work. Blake is an old buddy from when I was growing up in Oak Creek so he gives us a discount. Anyway, I walked into the office and this McLafferty bitch tells me some guy just took up the last four jobs and that I'm not needed. So I was already pissed off, Samantha and I were going to have to struggle through another week down on caps. 
    
  We leave, pack full of rations and water strapped on Samantha's back. As we are walking back five guys jump out from a billboard and a boulder somewhat armed. Pool-cues and peashooters, these guys were clueless, I'm not convinced half of them even had the right ammunition in their shitty, duck taped, single-shot shotguns. These fiends were far from professional, obviously all hopped up on chems and cheap booze. The leader of the pack manages to sputter out something about a toll road, showing of his single digit yellow teeth. Normally, Samantha and I would have paid up and moved on but we were already desperate for caps. Stalling as best I could, Samantha gets ready to draw and put down these strung out assholes. Before Samantha's gun left its holster the whole group notices this NCR patrol come sprinting towards us, rifles leveled.
""Oh Thank God!"" I thought to myself as Samantha and I immediately started to run to the patrol. They open fire, unable to decipher us from the fiends. Everyone goes down from the barrage of hot led, Samantha and myself included. I took a single 5.56 round in the thigh, breaking the bone and leaving me momentarily paralyzed. My left hand was also peppered, unbeknownst to me at the time. I knew the patrol would end me if I stirred but I chanced a peak at Samantha, who was facedown in a puddle of her own blood. I restrained a sob as realization was graced upon me and silent tears sailed down the side of my dirty face, not from the physical pain but rather the emotional, a pain I would feel for the last time not because of the span of my life but because I had nothing left to feel. The NCR patrol poked around some, enough to scavenge the newly purchased rations and 10 millimeter ammo Samantha had on her, I closed my eyes and pretended not to hear the rest of the encounter. 

  The patrol shouldered their newly looted supplies and continued on. I scrambled toward Samantha with desperation, my last sheds of hope quickly leaving me. I arrive, my suspicions confirmed, I cradled her head in my arms, cried out, cursing all above and below. Her lifeless eyes stared beyond me. I hopelessly tried to drag her back to camp, my mangled appendages allowed for no such thing. In defeat, I half crawled, half limped back to camp catching you up to speed. 

  Here I am, bleeding and broken. I have no food, no water and no medical supplies. The only thing left to eat is a bullet. I could limp towards someone, anyone and tell them what happened, get Blake to ID the supplies, get those troops a court marshal. But what is the point? None of that brings back Samantha, and I just don't care anymore. I have maybe 3 more hours until I bleed out, I hope God doesn't mind if I take the express lane. 

  To anyone reading this who has a shred of decency I am leaving all of my belongings to Blake who works at the Crimson Caravan Company, he's like the only black guy there. 

  To Blake, remember the night you introduced me to Samantha and we stayed up all night drinking that homemade moonshine you made, those were the good times.

I saw a group of four survivors headed that way from near the waterworks not 20 minutes ago. I've got time to think now. The pilot from the Whitney County Sheriff's Department is doing pickups too. I see his helicopter heading for the hospital now.





What has it been? A week since the ""Green Flu"" became a national emergency? Maybe two weeks since the station got a story about patients with a new virus? Something like rabies they said. Has it been three days or four since Fairfield fell? How long since I watched those...things...those ""sick"" people swarm the gridlocked evacuation traffic, pulling people out of cars and just....mutilating them? 

I wanted to help but I couldn't. I couldn't land, it wasn't safe. So since then, I've been flying into the city multiple times per day to rescue anyone who didn't make it out during the evacuation. I've been taking them to Fort Drum up in New York, since none of the bases here in Pennsylvania are responding. There's a refugee camp there, but the soldiers there say everything is going to be shipped to the Gulf Coast by the end of the week. That means time is ticking for anyone left in the city.




This is my second run today, and might be my last. I was planning on coming back again overnight, but conditions are getting worse. Between this storm and my arm, I don't think I can fly much longer. 

Right, I should explain my arm. Earlier today, I saw a group of survivors, seven of them, running down Cherry Street being chased by those things. I couldn't land right there to get them, the street was too cluttered with cars, not to mention the power lines. I told them over the PA to run for a parking lot two blocks down where I could land. Only six made it, and with the horde hot on their heels. One of those things though, it grabbed one of the survivors with its tongue. Like, this thing's tongue was maybe thirty feet long, like some kind of goddamned frog. The poor bastard was hanging on to the door for dear life, but those infected people swarmed the helicopter. They were pounding on it, rocking it, and trying to pull this guy back into their mob. In the chaos, one of the things broke through my window and took a chunk out of my left arm. They ended up pulling that poor man off of the door, so I took off. I had to take off. If I could have landed closer, maybe all seven of them would have made it. So many if's.





I feel hot, sweaty, and the skin around the bite is dark purplish-black and clammy. But as long as I can still fly, I will. So I just keep broadcasting, keep calling out into the storm. ""Mercy Hospital, are you there?"" over and over again. It's on a loop in my mind. If I'm not radioing Mercy, I'm on the PA saying the same thing over and over: ""To anyone who can hear this, proceed to Mercy Hospital for evacuation."" I'm starting to doubt anyone *can* hear this. I'm starting to doubt those four survivors I saw earlier made it to the hospital at all...





Wait! A voice! That's them! Alright, come on man, you can do this. One more run then back to Fort Drum. One more run then you can let the doctors look at your arm. You have to do this, you owe it to these people. You owe it to all the others you couldn't help. 





""Okay, I'm on my way. ETA 15 minutes, just hang in there. News Chopper Five, out.""

""Sorry?""

""The Dragonborn. Did you meet him?""

The man was shaken from his thoughts. Norland was new to the legion, and such a curiosity could be forgiven. They all asked about the Dragonborn.

""Aye. I was at Windhelm."" The man sipped his mead.

Norland was incredulous ""You were there? When the hero Dragonborn slew the Usurper? What a song to sing!""

The man watched his mug froth as it struck upon the table. ""Aye.""
***
""Glad you're here.""

The Dragonborn nodded back at me, his shadowed eyes unblinking. I did not see recognition. His face stayed hidden behind his helmet, smithed of the bones of slain dragons. It was not soon after that the battle begun.

I was barely over the bridge when I met my first Stormcloak. Hiding behind his shield, the poor lad. Mustn't have witnessed his sixteenth birthday before I struck the weak piece of wood till it shattered. Nothing protected him then, and there was terror in his eyes when I struck him through the chest with my blade.

Aye, I was at Windhelm. I cheered with Tullius and the Legion upon our victory, but I did not easily forget that young boy while the other men seemed to brush away their kills. When you sharpen your blade you think nothing of the flesh it will carve. Windhelm was butchery with the Dragonborn fighting for the Empire.

He was as fearless as he was reckless, I would not doubt that this hero killed Imperials at Windhelm as well as Stormcloaks. I remember his cries in the dragon language, the Thu'um shaking my bones as he swung his battleaxe at an impossible, inhuman speed. These poor, helpless men seemed to freeze as they were met with his weapon. I would never wish such a death upon even my enemies, I only hope they have found warmth in Sovngard.

I saw this warrior set not twenty Stormcloak men on fire with quick words. The dragonflame killed quickly, and it killed painfully. The shout had burned hot enough to make the very stones of Windhelm groan as they pushed against each other. Thank the divines this grinding drowned out the rebel screams.

I assume Ulfric was spared no mercy by the stronger Thu'um. It seemed the Dragonborn did not offer such a gift to anyone. I am glad I did not witness what happened in The Palace of the Kings that day, the gods know what torture the Dragonborn put the Usurper to.

Aye, Ulfric was slain. Aye, the rebellion was settled.

Aye. I was at Windhelm.
***
The man rose. His mug was empty.

""So? Tell me about the battle!"" It was Norland again, the poor boy. How long before he too would hide behind his shield?

""You don't want to hear about the Dragonborn.""

The man was silent as he strode to the inn's door. The barkeep shouted to him.

""You leave for Riverwood?""

""Aye.""

""Thank your uncle Torvold for the spare iron you brought. I'm having them smelted to new pots for the Skeever on the morrow.""

""Aye, I will.""

""Safe travels.""

It's a hard life for a lone trader. After eating, I was about to make my way south &amp; continue scavenging when I spot this guy enter the mess hall, wearing a vault suit.
It's not everyday you see these guys pop up topside.


Last time I saw a vault dweller, I'd just hit puberty, sniping ants from an old truck. I heard somebody behind me, 50 feet away. He had the number 11 on his vault suit. He was cursing to himself like a nutjob, crying. I guess vault life isn't all its cracked up to be. This guy's suit has a different number though, 21. Not to mention he was armed to the teeth &amp; had a Mohawk... If he wasn't wearing the suit, I'd have took him for a raider. 

The guy comes in and without saying anything just eats this weird ass meat pie Jas made, I didn't see 1 cap get passed. Jas wouldn't tell me what the hell was in it, ""strange meat"" my ass. But hell, she didn't tell me it was free. I'd have ate it &amp; kept my damn rifle. I swore her asshole of a husband ran the register, haven't seen him in days. Anyway...

Then this guy heads over to the table &amp; I notice there was a star bottle cap right on the table, instant flashbacks of wild star bottlecap adventures ensues, felt like a jet rush. I've seen guys fight to the death over these caps. The guy swipes it like it was nothing. It cost me me 20 years, 10 bullet wounds, 5 scars &amp; 3 teeth just to get 6 of those damn caps. 6 more would've surely killed me.

Next thing I know, this guy looks at his Pipboy (another rarity) &amp; then he's out the door. I gotta tell this kid what he's got.

We get outside &amp; next thing I know Chomps is talking this guy out of going north. I can't quite hear what the vault guy is saying though. Not only does this guy go north, he's running right into Quarry Junction! Against every fiber of my being, I run in after him, I HAVE TO TELL HIM about that bottle cap. Almost immediately, barely breaching the quarry, there are 5 Deathclaws coming for this guy &amp; to make matters worse, 4 Legion guys are bee-lining towards us from the rear. I had hoped they would 180 at the sight of what was ahead... 

 
I must have been out of my mind to follow him in here, it's almost as if time slowed down as bullets, blood &amp; bodies are flying everywhere in slow motion. In the midst of the madness this guy is literally stuffing his face with med-x, shooting up psycho with one hand &amp; firing a grenade launcher with the other... It's amazing he could even, stand or see straight, let alone fire his weapon. Legion guys are charging at him &amp; the Deathclaws with machetes, brush guns &amp; sub machine-guns.
Just when I thought this couldn't possibly get any worse, 2 of the largest Deathclaws I had ever seen were running straight towards us.

Of all of the days to sell my rifle. What good was keeping the ammo?

As bullets &amp; Deathclaws miraculously flew past me in almost sheer ignorance of my presence, I was convinced that if there was a hell, it'd be an eternal day spa by comparison to this pants-shitting moment. 

Even still I pushed forward, against all odds, I feigned ignorance to the chaos. Maybe it was destiny that pushed me? 20 years, 10 bullet wounds, 5 scars &amp; 3 teeth for this moment. Yes... I gotta tell him, NO MATTER WHAT...

Her prey was walking towards her in the near dark, oblivious, stopping now and then to pick snowberries. She concentrated on slowing her breathing and focusing her night vision. She adjusted her grip on the finely balanced Orcish dagger in her right hand. She tilted it slightly so the moonlight would not reveal it.


The Dark Brotherhood armour blended her into the night and silenced her every move. She felt the bloodlust rise as her prey came closer. It was more delicious than the best skooma or the sweetest lover. This was her favourite moment, the glorious anticipation was almost as good as when the knife first bit, the skin split and the blood flowed.


Her moment arrived.


She leapt from her hiding place and pounced on the unsuspecting traveller. She knew not and cared not who wanted him dead, it was her duty and her pleasure to carry out the contract. The reward was almost unnecessary as the satisfaction was so much more valued.


She grabbed the stranger by the throat but found herself easily thrown off. She was momentarily shocked but leapt at him again, more determined. The stranger had swiftly equipped himself with dual swords; one a sharp edged Orc forged green demon, flashing in the moonlight and echoing her own blade, the other a blood-stained war-horse of Imperial steel, firmly gripped and expertly wielded.


She managed to block the slicing orcish blade with her own dagger, but the Imperial sword flashed by and sliced her forearm. For the first time in her life the Assassin stepped back. Her armour and skin was not enough to ward off the onslaught. She ducked and parried as best she could but she was no match for this unassuming stranger, in a blurring move she felt a chest splitting blow across her breast and as she fell, her life’s blood pouring from her, she breathed her last words “Sithis, claim me!”


Her last image was that of the dark frozen sky and the Shadow constellation shining high above her.

I'm a blade in the crowd, an eagle ready to strike at any moment. When my master gives me the signal, my brothers and sisters will join him and complete the task that brought us together: to liberate Rome. 


Who are we? Well, we are Assassins, a union of men and women who have devoted their lives to protect the freedom of every man, woman and child against those who would take it from them. Our enemy may be any ""leader"" who misuse their power, or any other that would deprive people of their humanity, but most of these are one of our nemesis: the Templars.


By now you are probably asking ""How in the world did I, Riccardo Fabbiano, the son of a simple carpenter, join such a mysterious group?"". Well then, here is my story:



I grew up here in Rome, and have lived here all my life. My father died of sickness when I was 5 and my mother also died of sickness 11 years later. My oldest brother moved to Venezia to work as an archer, but he was killed. So the only ones who were left of my family about a year ago was me, my younger brother and my uncle who worked as a tailor. 


When the Borgias took the power of Rome, they really turned the city into an inferno for merchants. Many shops were closed, and the bad business drove many out of the city. When my uncle's tailor shop was closed by the Borgias, my uncle resisted and was therefor killed by the guards. My brother and I swore that we would have justice, so we did what we thought was a great plan. As carpenters, we obviously had no experience in planning a war, so we assumed that if we outnumbered the guards in one sector, we would inspire others to join us and could together push towards the Vatican to drive out the Borgias.

My heart is heavy when I think of that day. We approached a group of four guards on the Aventine. We had brought 15 men, this would be easy. I grabbed an apple, spat on it and threw it at one of the guards. His face showed a mixed expression of shock, rage and disgust as he took of the saliva from where the apple had hit him. Then the fight was on. They were armed with swords, most of us were armed with knives, some used hammers and other tools, some were unarmed. We brought down two easily, but then they got reinforcement. They were now 13 guards, some with plate armor and two-handed swords. We called a retreat, but my brother didn't make it. The guards killed him quickly though, a fast decapitation. They were about to kill me too, but something else brought their attention; an explosion at the Aventine tower. Most guards ran towards the tower, but the man I had threw the apple on and three of his friends began to chase me. I took the sword of the guard we had defeated and ran. I reached a cliff, which left me trapped, surrounded by guards. Suddenly, a white-robed man appeared, flying towards one of them and quickly impaled him with a blade. I took my chance and began to fight, and together the man and I killed the other two. I knelt, and he said ""The liberation of Roma has begun"". ""If I can help others as you have helped me, I most certainly will"" I replied. That man was Ezio Auditore, and that day was the day I joined the Assassins.


During the following months I learned more than a normal man learns during a lifetime. I learned how to kill a man with grace, I learned how to handle almost any weapon, I learned how to disappear into thin air and most importantly; I learned the way of the Assassin's Creed and its tenets.  

We, the apprentices, could spend an entire day just following Ezio, attack any man in his way, bring a rain of bolts over his enemies and eliminating any man that we needed gone. I can't tell you how many hours I have spent in haystacks, just lying there and waiting for the moment to strike. It's not a pleasant experience, be sure of that. 

After three months, Ezio began sending us on contracts all across Europe. I've been to Constantinople, Moscow, London, Paris and many more places. We did everything from stealing documents to killing major targets. At first I was enraged because it had nothing to do with liberating Rome, but then I opened my eyes and saw that destroying any Templar influence is important for us to liberate Rome.

A month ago, Ezio decided that it was time that I no longer was to be seen as a recruit, but as a real assassin. The ritual were the assassin insignia is burned onto your finger was completed, and I performed the traditional leap of faith. I was now an assassin.


Now, we have approached Cesare by the gates of Rome, rallying his men. We are going to finish what we started, and I will have my vengeance. I can hear Ezio shouting together with the other high ranked assassins, like La Volpe and Machiavelli. I can hear a whistle, I shall now join my master. 

I leap from the rooftop, air assassinate a guard and launch towards the next. Ezio is armed with The Apple of Eden, and since he can not wield a weapon then, I will protect him.


The battle is over, we won and Cesare has been captured. However, I will not live to celebrate it. I have been wounded, a sword impaled me in the back, and I'm dying. I can see Cesare being dragged away, and I'm smiling. Rome is free now, just as it should be. I have no regrets, I am proud to die today.

Ezio approaches me, and I can see that he knows that I can't be saved.

1361533303.0,30,self.LifeasanNPC,190lrc,[Deus Ex] Met the new nano-augmented agent. What a cunt.,benmuzz,36,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/190lrc/deus_ex_met_the_new_nanoaugmented_agent_what_a/,"Now I knew Denton mark II had a bad rep. It was his first operation and I'd already got word from the lads outside that he was being a dick, shooting all the NSF outside the statue but leaving the robot to rip us to shreds with its miniguns right outside the entrance. Also a guy in my unit swears that he saw him shoot a barrel of poison gas when they were all in the lobby after the leader had been captured. They told their commanding officer but he dismissed it as an NSF trap. I used to think the ""serious damage to all exposed mucous membranes"" warning on the gas was another way of saying ""if you're a pussy then it might give you a cough"", but after seeing a few of the guys in the medical wing I've changed my tune. Plus he later dobbed in Kaplan to General Carter, and walked in on Shannon in the ladies' toilet like a fucking pervert. 

ANYWAY, my point is, even after hearing all this shit about Denton 2, I was still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Honestly, I was actually quite excited to see him. I kind of looked up to his brother when I joined the coalition, and I was pretty honoured to be on duty in the corridor by his office because I knew I'd get to see him. 

So a bit later he comes down. He ignores me at first, and goes straight into his office and uses the computer. Bit rude, but whatever. Then - and I swear this is true - he gets out a knife and starts slashing all the boxes of stuff in his room like a fucking maniac. Just stabbing and hacking at them until they collapse. I was terrified, it's horrific to see someone lose control like that, but I stayed at my post because...well, I'm a soldier. 

Then he *picked up a sofa*. A huge leather sofa, just picked it up. Walked out into the corridor with it... and just THREW IT AT ME. It was so unexpected I didn't have time to move, and I felt my chest buckle from the impact, slamming me against the wall. I was winded and bleeding from my stomach. I didn't know what to say, I was so shocked I just blurted out ""stop that"". But then he just stared at me, like he was fucking brain dead. He seemed to have no idea that what he'd done was insane. But he just kept staring at me and then raised his eyebrows as if I should speak. What the fuck do you say to someone like that?? I just sarcastically said ""good job sir""...saying anything else to a psychopath like that could have provoked him to violence and as he'd fractured most of my ribs with his furniture attack I was in no position to fight. I was waiting for him to reply, to apologise... fucking respond in any way, basically... but nope. Instead, he ran into the conference room, just jogging round the table. This little cupboard seemed to catch his eye, it's the one where we keep the flare darts for emergencies. He tried to get in but we have a tiny padlock on it for health and safety reasons. I was about to ask him if he wanted the key, when he jumped on the table and out of nowhere got out a fucking GEP launcher. I was so stunned that it took me a moment to realise what he was doing, I just managed to drop down behind the wall as HE FIRED A MISSILE INTO THE CABINET at almost point blank range. The window above me shattered, adding shards of glass to the mix of wood, metal and concrete that came flying out of that room into the corridor. I was deafened and disorientated from the explosion and the rubble that had fallen on me, but poked my head up enough to see Denton casually picking through the charred remains of the cabinet, putting the flare darts in his pocket before calmly walking into the break room with agent russian and the skul-gun freak. Then they... just started chatting and giving each other banter about the operation. Like nothing had even happened. I couldn't believe it. Was this a nightmare?

I staggered on to my knees, choking on the concrete dust that covered me... and dragged myself, half-crawling, into Manderley's secretary's office, where I passed out. Fuck that guy.

I’m a business man, a doer, I make the world go around and yet here I am curled up on the ground staring at a door of my apartment, listening to the muffled sounds of men and woman being slaughtered by those god-damn things! How I survived this long I don’t know. I saw that poor intern girl get cut to pieces right before my very eyes! I didn’t know what to do than either. I just stood there in shock, every cell in me frozen. My mind seemed to be twisting in on its self from exposure to such an instant upheaval of reality. It was searching for an explanation, a foot hold, anything that would work as a jumping point to process this new world. But there was nothing. At one point I managed to look away from her, only to see more of the beasts clumsily charging towards me, taking down whoever was unlucky enough to be within reach of their dreadful blades of bone and flesh. 

I looked down again at the girl, but upon seeing nothing but a mass of red pulp where she had laid I thought she managed to get away. However, the surge of optimism I felt could not have left me any quicker. Upon closer inspection I realized the red pulp I was staring at was her. With that my mind gained its foothold. I was out of that office building and headed for my home, the only place my feet seemed willing to take me.

Running down the blood drenched corridors of that city was surreal. It was as if someone had taken a planetary-sized shipment of paint and started spraying it with a hose on every surface. In the consumer district the doorways and windows of restaurants and shops where piled with bodies. As I ran past these places I’d occasionally slip in pools of blood which had made the metallic ground slick. 

I had almost reached the elevator that would take me from the consumer district to my apartment complex when I noticed something that even now perturbs me. The area was deserted. I was the only living being, man or beast. I stopped running and my eyes started darting around, from shop to shop, window to window, all drenched in red and filled with bodies. In the distance I could hear more people fall to the beasts, and yet here I was, in the most heavily populated area in this sector of the station, absolutely alone. I just stood there; my mind slowly began to twist again. It felt as though I was back at the office, staring at the intern girl being ripped apart by the beasts. I could see her clearly before me, an angelic face staring right at me with a comforting smile. Even the beast that was attacking her seemed to be at peace, each lunge of its blades piercing her side only to have the wound healed the moment the blade left her body; every appendage torn off her fragile figure instantly reattaching only to be torn off again. The beast seemed joyful for having found a companion to perpetually slaughter.

Then I heard a bird. Than another, and yet another until it sounded as if behind me an entire flock of crows had descended upon the consumer district to pick at the corpses. I remained still, afraid that my movement might scare them off, such beautiful creatures crows are. I was brought back to text books I had read as child about the forests of Earth, though I had never actually seen one myself. I had been breed and raised for the city, business was my game, even at a young age, and I never had time for such distractions; though I had always been curious. Eventually I turned, and expecting to see trees my mind completely twisted in on its self upon the sight I beheld instead. I could not understand why the crows looked and behaved so strangely. It was as if they were made of flesh and shaped like two wings without a body. They flew from corpse to corpse, holding them with hand-like talons and a beak that devoured them whole. They would engulf a corpse, and drop it again; moving on to the next corpse, and so on and so on. And after a moment, the dropped corpses would begin to move.
 
These were no crows, they were doves. They were bringing life back to this dead district. 

One approached me, and I let down my defenses. I saw in the wings of flesh the angelic face of the intern girl, however, this time the beast that was over her had a much more human face. The bird crept closer to me, and closer yet, until I could make out the image of the beasts on its wings. It was me. My hands knew nothing but the feeling of warm blood washing down the blades that had replaced my arms. My mind knew nothing but the sweet serenity of oneness with those whose bodies had been perfected along with mine. 

The dove was upon me, engulfing me, and for an instant I let it do its will. And I would have allowed it to change me into one of them had I not remembered the red pulp the beast had turned the intern girl into after its slaughter. My mind once again found its foot hold. Now before me there was no angelic face promising me an eternity, but only the fleshy monster wrapping its self around my head, blood drenched tentacles attempting to force me to submit. 

My hands clawed at the fleshy creature; however, I could get no hold on it. I could feel my body beginning to change, but I could not give up. Even as I sit here in fear, after having thought over the event many times, I do not know what strength of mind possessed me to continue to fight the creature's grasp. There was no hope and I knew it just as much as I know it now. But everything in me fought, almost to the death. 

A bright blast of energy exploded through my fleshy mask, and through the bits of matter and blood dripping from my face I could make out a man in a standard engineering suit, wielding a plasma cutter. He ran up to me, picked me up by the arm and yelled at me to run for it. He took off for the elevator, leaving me shell shocked. I looked down the streets of the district and saw just how many of these beasts had been created, and how many more were still to come. I turned toward the elevator and saw him beckoning for me to join him. I ran the few blocks I had left and gazed backwards, only half-aware, at the hundreds of beasts coming our way.

The doors closed and I pushed the button that would take me to my floor. I looked at the engineer; he was having a frantic conversation with someone, perhaps another engineer. Maybe they were trying to keep life support systems going. It seemed like a noble quest, one fitting of a man of such intelligence who chooses to serve the rest of society rather than rule it. There’s likely not much point in keeping this city alive, but a noble quest none the less.

 I did not speak for fear of interrupting his conversation and train of thought. Once the elevator reached my floor I got off. The engineer stayed behind, hit another button and nodded towards me before the doors closed.

I made my way to my apartment, but before the door opened I sat down. I’ve been staring at my door ever since. I’m tired, and even though the other side of that door has a bed; I’m too afraid to sleep. I’m hungry, and even though the other side of the door has food; I’m too sick to eat. I’m lonely, and even though the other side of that door has pictures of me and an intern girl, who I raised from birth, who I watched grow up; I’m too heartbroken to remember any of it.

I couldn't help but make a backstory for him, and thought I'd share. Enjoy!

The wind brushed my hair out of my face, just like the hand of my mother would before he was born. A frown creased my face, but I shook my head and let the worries and bad memories drift off like leaves in a Frostfall breeze. I had food, I had a horse, and I had an adventure waiting to unfold before my feet.

Suddenly, the horse's ears pricked up. I paused, but didn't hear anything. A few more seconds, and then I continued on, wary and with all the leaves blown back in my face, though not a hint of wind played at the tops of the trees. 

""Just a rabbit in the bushes,"" I muttered, wanting to believe it more than actually believing. A sense of unease now hung stale in the morning air. Shivering, I kicked at the horse's sides and continued my journey, scanning the sides of the road as I went. I led him around the bend in the road and nearly cried out when a dozen soldiers in blue seemed to appear in the clearing in front of me. Stormcloaks!

""Move along traveller. You're interfering with official business,"" a burly soldier with a massive axe said, stepping in front of me.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. All of those swords made me nervous. Just as I turned around, armed men, wearing Imperial armor, stepped out from the surrounding shadows. A clattering noise came from the road behind me, and a tall, gray-haired man led a column of Imperial troops into the clearing. The Stormcloaks drew swords and made a protective circle around a man in expensive clothes. 

""Drop your weapons, all of you,"" barked the tall man. ""You can't hope to leave here breathing!""

There was no sound from the Stormcloaks, merely a determined silence. The rich man let out a sigh. It was filled with sorrow.

""He's right. Lay down your arms, I'd rather not stain the ground without a purpose."" The voice was deep, powerful, and the Stormcloaks put down their swords without protest.

""Bind them."" The tall man ordered. And I let myself be bound. What choice did I have?

I was shoved roughly onto a cart with a tall blond warrior, the rich man, and some other poor soul caught in the ambush. They were unconscious, with a nasty looking gash above their ear. The blond Nord had been watching me closely.

""That horse you were riding; it wasn't yours, was it?""

I looked away, and he knew everything in that action. Was it my fault that the only way to escape my miserable life was on another's horse. I was going to come back, pay everything and a little extra. Maybe if my father had so much as looked at me after my strong, stupid brother was born this wouldn't have happened. I wanted to cry, but that would only prove the bastard right.

The other on the cart stirred. About time. The Nord looked over at them. 

""Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked straight into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.""

Oh, so now I'm the bad guy? And people wonder why I wanted to leave Skyrim and not look back. ""Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you,I could've stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell."" Great wording, now I'm admitting I stole the horse. I turned to the other one, probably the only thing in the cart that wasn't already against me. ""You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.""

""We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief."" Of course the Nord had something to say. At least he sounds moderately intelligent. The driver shouted something. I couldn't make it out over the rumbling of wheels over the road, but if it had been important I'm sure they would have made sure we heard. I turned to face the rich man, now wearing a gag. ""And what's wrong with him, huh?""

""Watch your tongue,"" the Nord snapped. ""You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.""

Realization dawned, swift and sudden and but not at all warm. ""Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh Gods, where are they taking us?""

The Nord stared up at the sky. ""I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.""

No. No no no no. ""No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening."" How could my future become the headsman's block in such short a time?

The Nord looked down and met my eyes. ""Hey, what village are you from horse thief?""

I scowled. ""Why do you care?"" It's not like anyone else gives a skeever tail about what happens to me.

""A Nord's last thoughts should be of home""

He was right. Not all of my memories were bad ones. This is my homeland, and no matter how far away I go I'll always be a Nord. ""Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.""

The carriage pulled up at a walled city, and the gates creaked open. This was Helgen. My father took me here as a boy. Apparently the Nord had been too, and I heard the word mead. Seems to be a common theme in Skyrim. A soldier shouted over to the tall man, now riding a horse in front of the caravan.

""General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!"" At least now I knew my captor. ""Good. Let's get this over with.""

I finally found the faith my mother had wanted my to so badly. ""Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.""

The Nord muttered something about elves, and the carriage continued to the center of town. It finally stopped by a tower, with an executioner waiting in front of it. This was all too weird. What next, dragons attacking? ""Why are we stopping?""

The Nord looked over. ""Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting.""

I couldn't help myself. ""No! Wait! We're not rebels!""

""Face your death with some courage, thief."" How could somebody be brave in a time like this? Stupid, idiot Nords. I turned to him. ""You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!""

Nobody listened. The Nord's name was Ralof. He was from Riverwood, a small town not far from here. Then my name was called. I walked up to the Imperial captain, trying to explain myself. I'm not a rebel! I have more in common with the Imperials than these blood-thirsty Northmen. But her face never changed. It was hopeless. But the gate was so close! I could make it!

So I ran. I ran as fast as I could with my hands bound in front of me. The Imperial captain shouted. ""Halt!""

 I don't think so. ""You're not going to kill me!"" I shouted back.

Maybe this is what Nords feel in battle. What have I been missing? A smile brushed my lips, but I heard a twang and felt a blow to my back, and as I rushed towards the gate the ground rushed towards me.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_1d91ju,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1d91ju/skyrim_lokirs_story/,
1364084387.0,29,self.LifeasanNPC,1avz1v,[Skyrim] A Guard's Tale: Part 3 The Prisoner Returns,Little_but_Fierce,44,15,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1avz1v/skyrim_a_guards_tale_part_3_the_prisoner_returns/,"“You’re joking.” I said to Heric.


I was in Belethor’s shop trying to get him to talk about Skooma manufacture in the ‘Run. Caius had declared a crack down on the drug and was on a mission to ‘clean-up’ the city; the rest of us hadn’t even known there was a problem. I mean really, it wasn’t like we were Riften.


Caius was convinced the Cats were involved but needed firm evidence in order to raid them the next time the caravan came. Apparently the Jarl had insisted he could only proceed with documented proof, of the pages and pages kind. Caius was a well-known Cat hater and there were rumours he’d even tried to pay the Companions to drive them out of the ‘Run; but you didn’t hear that from me.


Heric had been on Draggers duty (as we called Dragonsreach – though not within the Jarl’s earshot) and got to listen in to Balgruuf carving Caius a new Briar’s heart - as Heric put it. It seemed the Jarl felt with the Civil War at a delicate stage, Helgen being destroyed by a dragon and talk of the Dawnguard reforming; a skooma problem was last thing he wanted to worry about. In fact he’d said very loudly he’d be happy to *have* a skooma problem if that was the *only* thing he had to worry about. As Heric told it, Caius had scuttled out of there faster than an angry mudcrab. But not before he got the Jarl to approve his investigation, with terms.


So I’d been sent to interview Belly. Now, even the draugr up at Bleak Falls knew if Belly knew the location of Sovngarde itself he wouldn’t spill if his life depended on it, which it would of course, but you get my point. He might sell you his sister, his brother, his wife and his children (if he had any) but he was no snitch. And the man could talk the skin off a salmon so currently I was in possession of a not so new clothes iron, which I didn’t need and had purchased at an apparently bargain price. I blamed Caius and decided he’d be getting it for his next cake-day - but with my luck he’d probably like it. So you couldn’t say I’d come away empty-handed, but I would be reporting that Belly knew nothing.


Heric had burst in half-way between Belly trying to foist another ‘treasure’ on me, and me trying to leave the shop. Sigurd was sweeping right in front of the door which had prevented me from leaving earlier, (which I’d begun to wonder was deliberate) so it was a blessing, especially as he fell over Siggy on the way in. I pulled Heric up and dragged him outside as the shop boy untangled himself from his broom and before Belly was able to burden me with more junk. I hauled Heric over to Roddy - or was it Jon, no matter.


“Roddy, have you heard this?” he nodded slightly.


“It’s true,” Heric said. “That escaped prisoner, you know the one Jordic nicknamed ‘Smelly Pants’ on account of the amount of lavender you Luna, fetched out of his pockets, well he turned up bold as a bare-arsed bandit and walked straight up to the gate, where the twins nabbed him, account of his bounty still being active, you know over that sweet roll thing in the inn, and also the fighting ...”


“The point, Heric.” Roddy growled. Now I definitely knew it was Roddy. I’d know that growl anywhere. Roddy could growl in a cave full of Snow-Bears and they’d run for their little furry lives, I tell you.


“All right, all right. He paid the fine. Jordic searched him. No stolen goods, though how you’d know, I don’t know, I swear he had more stuff on him than the last time, Luna, you’d be glad you didn’t have to...”


“Grrrrwl” Roddy rumbled.


Heric continued “... and quick as you like he headed straight back into Draggers to see the Jarl.”


“The Jarl?” I said.


“Yes. The Jarl. You know, Balgruuf.”


“I know the Jarl Heric.”


“Course you do. And Farengar was all excited too.”


“Farengar?”


“Yes. The Court Wizard. You know. Farengar.” Heric stated.


“I know Farengar, Heric.”


“Why’d you ask then?”


“Heric!” I was about to smack his helmet, but at that moment we were distracted by a guard sprinting through the marketplace and up the steps to the Wind District, two at a time. Ysolda nearly went flying and a cheese wheel bounced off Carlotta’s stall.


“That looked like...” Heric said.


“Jon the Black,” Roddy interrupted.


“What’s going on?” I said. 


We debated a moment and I went down to the gate from where the guard had come, thinking if Loki was on duty he’d know what was happening, and Heric headed back up to Draggers to listen out up there.


Jon the Red was on duty and was agitated to say the least. He had his steel sword out, the one his mother had sent him from Solitude, the one she’d had engraved with his name and he got Adrienne to personally sharpen every week.


“Jon what’s going on? We saw Jon – the other Jon, rabbitting it up to Daggers like he had a flame atronach torching his heels.”


“Dragon’s, Luna.” He said, “There’s a Dragon down at the Western, and I’m not allowed to leave my Daedra-cursed post.”


My mouth went dry. A dragon at Helgen was one thing, and it had all sounded a  bit farfetched, what with the whole story about Ulfric and the execution and the dragon just flying off after destroying the town. The three guards Irileth had sent up to Riverwood hadn’t returned yet so we’d no reliable account from anyone we knew. In truth we’d only half believed it, or rather, half-hoped it wasn’t true.


None of us had fought, or even seen a dragon, and if it really had taken out Helgen, well the Divines only knew what it could do to the Western Watchtower. 


“Who is out there?” I said to Jon. The Western was on the gate barracks roster this week.


“Um, Lorhic, Hroki, Tor ... ”


“I’m going down there.” Jon grabbed me, “No, Luna, don’t. Not without orders. Caius would...”


“Cauis can kiss skeever butt.” I said.


Before I could wrestle away from him, we heard running and looked up towards Draggers.


Irileth was running towards us with a small group of Dragonsreach guards and that funny little prisoner in the lead, carrying a strange looking great sword. 


Irileth and the guards stopped at the barracks but the prisoner flashed past us with a happy grin and ran on through the gate. The guards looked reluctant and Irileth was having to give them a rousing ‘Let’s go kill us a Dragon’ speech. 

I struggled in Jon’s grip but he held me firm, he was as strong as Roddy too.


“No, Luna.” He whispered.


“But Loki. What about Loki.”


“Loki can take care of himself.”


Irileth had worked up the guards and they were finally heading through the gate.


“At least to the ramparts,” I pleaded to Jon, “I have to see it.”


“Okay, if you promise, you swear to Kynareth, no further. And if it comes this way, you come back in and defend the city. THAT’s your job.” Jon said.


“Okay, okay. I swear. ” and he let me go.


I sped past the twins who were standing alert with iron swords at the ready and Whitrun shields raised. They were a silly pair but no-one could beat them on slash and bash.


I ran to my spot and looked towards the tower. The day was sunny and warm. It was a very pretty day in the ‘Run, bunny tail white tufts of clouds skipping across the heart-breakingly blue sky. I could see soft grey smoke wafting lazily up in front of the tower. Something had set the tower on fire. I couldn’t see anything flying around, but then I wasn’t really sure what I was looking for, a giant skeever with wings? A flying Argonian breathing fire? I saw Irileth and her band disappear around a bend in the road.


And then, a few moments later, a shadow, a swooping, dark, dangerous and definitely dragon-shaped shadow was circling the Western Watchtower. I automatically pulled out my sword, as useless as I was so far away.


There was a dragon, a real live, fire-breathing dragon, it could be nothing else. I heard a distant roar and saw the bright torrent of fire blasting from its mouth. I imagined I could feel the searing heat.


I asked myself, how did you fight that? And how could you possibly win, and what... what if there was more than one...

I used to have a nice job working at the co-op in Westside for a while, decent caps, great boss. But eventually, I made the mistake that so many New Vegas residents make; I started using chems. It began with not-so-innocently, albeit harmless, visits to Casa Madrid. Nightly ""stops"" began to mix with Med-X, and long story short, I lost my job and began squatting in Freeside. I was living a meaningless existence, living for the next high. Well, eventually this stranger shows up in Freeside. I knew if someone was just passing through these parts, they were probably headed to the Strip. And because they were headed to the Strip, chances are they were generally unconcerned with the goings on of Freeside, let alone a hopeless, worthless, aging junkie. I was just starting to feel the itch for my next hit when the very same stranger appears in the destroyed building I was staying in.

    The most amazing thing happened to us. On this day, I saw something beyond myself. Something that I could not have fathomed in all my experience. But first, I must get our recent battle off my bosom. The Dragonborn and I were making our way, past Riften, to check for the loot he left behind on his recent quest. Dawnguard is full of weapons and coins that will aid our future pilgrimages. We made our way through the snow filled forest when my thane stopped us. I asked him, “what do you see?” He just peered left to right. I could only hear the wind blowing through the branches and the snow slapping our cold steel, but the Dragonborn knew better. He readied his incinerate spell and fired a shot into the frozen forest. We waited to see if anything would respond, but there was only silence. It was then, a vampire jumped out of the trees and ran for us. You could hear the clanking of his armor as he rushed. I knew that arrows would only bounce off that armor of his. So, I decided to use my axe. The vampire hurled for us and casted a shield spell while flying through the air. The Dragonborn tried to pull out his mace, but it was too swift. It tackled him to the ground, causing them to slide and plow snow away from them. It tried to make dinner of his throat, but I gave it a taste of my honed steel right to his chest cavity. He lunged for recovery, but my thane grabbed his leg and played whack a skeever with his head. This vampire must have fed recently, for buckets of blood spilled all over the ground. The mist raised as the Dragonborn had his way. Thats when we heard something in the distance.    
    My thane told me stories about these creatures, but I had never seen one with my own eyes. The wind blew even harder as the Dragonborn dropped the now dead pulp. The storm was so strong we couldn’t even see a few feet in front of us. I feared for my life in this moment. A man then walked into our view, clapping and laughing. “We have been hunting this blood sucker for days now,” he said to us with his brash attitude. He stood in front of us naked in the elements as he said, “you know we came here to feed on him, but he is cold and lifeless now. Such a shame, I think you two will provide a better meal.” Two red glowing eyes then appeared next to the man and my thane pulled me back behind him. He then started to erupt in laughter and I readied my bow. I raised my weapon and pulled back an arrow, as his laughter turned to screaming. His eyes turned red and his forearms split open like a banana. It wasn’t just his arms, but his legs and chest split open as well. Fur branched out of his body and his face erupted into hair and teeth. I have never seen such a sight, diary. It was as if he just walked out of his skin and grew three feet taller. His friends then walked forward out of the storm. Three stood in front of us now, howling before their kill. The Dragonborn turned and looked into my eyes. He said to me as he pulled off his shield, “We will make it out of this. We have to...” I will not lie, diary. I quivered a bit at the sight of these beasts.    
    I nodded, took his shield, and pulled out my sword. The beasts then dashed for us and the Dragonborn turned and foosed their leader. He flew back into the storm and I braced myself for impact. One of them threw their best slice but my shield was built at the Skyforge. I blocked its attack and pushed back with all of my force. The beast left its guard down and I sliced down the middle of the hairy monster’s torso. It howled in desolation as it grabbed its wound. It kneeled down and screamed it pain. The blood of the creature melted the snow as it dripped to the ground. I knew I had to finish the job, so I stood over the beast and beat its head in with my shield. It stubbled through the snow as I reared my steel back and took its head. I turned to look back to hear more howling as my thane was burning the other to dust. You could smell the cooked meat as the wind blew through.    
    I looked for the leader, but I could only see snow and trees. I turned to my thane and asked, “where is the leader?” There was not a response from him. We just waited as the snow died down. We searched for hours, but we came up with nil. We decided to move on to Dawnguard to retrieve our spoils. I feel we should have found him, but it is senseless to spend precious resources on something you cannot find out in the wild. I fear that isn’t the last we will see of him. This isn’t even the good part I mentioned earlier. I must leave now, though. For duty calls.    
    Until next time.

I bought my wife some flowers (the proceeds going to charity of course) and put on my studly top hat and vest.  I may not be the prophet, but I could almost guarantee that after the fair I would not need a Bucking Bronco salt to go for a ride.  So looking every bit the dashing gent that I am, I took my wife by the hand and began to lead her towards the fair.  Along the way we stopped and listened to the newest hit song ""God Only Knows"" composed by the fabulous Albert Fink and sung by a delightful barbershop quartet.

After the quartet had left and we stopped dancing we went to the fair.  There we played some games (I got to shoot a representation of Fitsroy in the face, the Vox bitch) and saw a Handyman.  I must say, his moves must not be quite as smooth as mine to have developed forearms of such proportions.  From there we moved on to the annual raffle, and grabbed our baseball.  I had #42, the wife had #76.  After a few minutes the announcer called #77, ""Oh, you were so close honey"" I said, after seeing my wife's look of disappointment.

Then shit got weird.

#77 steps up and tries to throw the ball at the announcer.  He was abruptly stopped by the police of course, but that wasn't even why.

This mother fucker turns out to be the False Shepard, he had the AD tattoo and everything.

After grabbing the nearest cop and shoving his face into the other cops skyhook, the False Shepard proceeds to go around beating the shit out of the entire nearby police force with said skyhook.  At this point it was mass chaos and I was just trying to get my wife out of there, I figured the authorities could handle it.  Anyway we got home safe but my wife had a full fledged panic attack, and is now recovering in bed.  Currently a city wide manhunt is going on to catch this bastard, but things look like they'll get worse before they get better.

Fuck the False Shepard.  He made my chances of getting laid drop so fast that it could have brought the whole city of Columbia down.  At least I still have my bad ass tophat.

In a big way. One minute I'm stationed on the outposts of City 17, fighting for my life against the Combine scourge, and the next... 

I don't even know how to best explain this one. Perhaps I should stay away from these health vials in the future. They appear to be causing wierd fever dreams...

Seemingly out of nowhere, I materialize in the middle of this field. It seems like an infinite, flat expanse, with nothing to see for miles. I also appear to lying down, completely flat to the ground. 

Suddenly, I see a pair of legs walk into my line of sight. At this point my body seizes up in fear and anxiety. I am unable to move. His stance seems focused on me, kind of like he requested my presence.

I then feel a warm beam of light attach itself to me. It hoists me up with a force which knocks the wind straight out of my stomach. 

It's the stranger! The beam of light seems to be coming directly out of some kind of cannon he's holding. He manipulates the beam to have my face stare directly at his. It came as a shock to find out that the stranger was, infact... Me. We looked identical in every regard. 

Within the next few minutes, my Doppelganger interacted with me in no meaningful way, other than to intricately pose my individual limbs with his alien looking technology. He was treating me as if I were some kind of toy; A ragdoll, even.

The next few minutes were a blur... It felt like some kind of torture. I felt the very muscles of my face tear and contort painfully, while my Doppelganger offered no comfort or help. He just shot me a blank glare, all the while pointing a rather unique looking handgun directly at me. I'm not even sure if the thing was able to shoot. I never saw him fire it.

It seems he tired of me rather quickly after the unbearable facial spasms came to an end. He just left me standing in his twisted, ""comical"" pose, until I suddenly found myself reappearing in the exact same spot I was taken from. I was back within the Barracks of the rebel base, as if none of these strange events had ever occured.

I was glad to finally be ""undone"" from the strange reality I had found myself in...

I will now continue to press on fighting this war against the Combine forces for the rest of my life, without so much as a further negative feeling towards it.

At what point in his tale is it decided that he plays one part or the other? Whether the stars shine from the gods above upon his shoulders or the shadows draw him in like a knave. I've not the wherewithal to know, but imprisonment gives one time to think about these things. When I was cursed I thought myself the victim of story where others might help me become strong once more.
	Sane.
	Alas, the trifles of the common man leave no time to ponder myself. Why one mistake could so readily destroy a life and then some. Was my punishment not so severe that the little girl had to die? Why must I be compelled to evil when my only mistake was wanting to be the hero? Are the naiveties of life so worth condemnation? I look to the stars through a broken stare and see that they have dimmed for me. Is this imprisonment, this forsaking of by my fellow man, the justice of an angry god or the whimsy of one who seeks pleasure in other's pain? For there is no greater pain than that of the soul.

And what cosmic event deigned the existence of this deity that now chases me to the brink of exhaustion to snuff out hope only to rekindle that spark in anticipation to suffocate it once more? He who would send one that speaks the tongue of dragons to free me only to have they that might seek his favor fall upon myself once more? Is there no rest? No divine plan? If all of this world is meaningless then what is there to give? What is life if it holds no value? There are those that would say value is not inherent, but rather bestown upon by those who would value. Am I simply not able to appreciate my lot?

Perhaps that is the simple truth that I have not been able to cultivate in myself. Perhaps my sacrifice is one for the good of others. Perhaps I might become the villain so that others may not. A necessary evil to unite men and keep them strong. That by becoming the villain, and sacrificing my wellbeing for others I become a hero in and of myself. Could it be that my desire for value was what made my soul so cheap in the first place whereas that of the dragon-speakers' could be equalized to a king's hoard? Are the right things for the wrong reasons still better than the wrong things for the right reasons? History would seem to dictate so. But history's perfect lessons are written by the flawed men that commit them. Do we make our own truths then, and damn the consequences? Were that my tale was a cautionary one in spite that none shall hear it.

My judge and reckoning comes on the footsteps of dragon tongue to end my worries. I am deserving of death, for death is a villain's only salvation. The only way to escape the torment of his own life. His reward for being the hero that other heroes cannot be. To become the hero of my story, I bow my head as another's villain.

""Face down, fucker!"" I yelled at this man. He was a political prisoner and I was ordered to harass him a little bit. And by little bit I mean to beat the ever living hell out of him. Along with me I had my two best buddies. Jim and Carl were long time prisoners in Blackgate. They worked for the Penguin longer than I had actually been in the scene, but they got caught at one massive coup. I, however, managed to escape multiple times. I got into crime some years ago, I sopped counting. Once you got into and used to it, time does not matter. You just live for job by job. You either dedicate yourself to one of the big guys or work as a kind of freelancer. I am the latter. It gives you enough freedom and variety in jobs and you don't feel like you're the bitch of someone. The longer you work for one guy, the higher the possibilty that he wants to get rid of you. I heard no one of Two-Face's guys makes it longer than 3 months. Then again he is a nutcase who makes his decisions by coin.


However why I got into crime scene is kind of tragic. I'm not talking about it to anyone because it makes me look weak. But the truth is, it was because of a girl. Do you know that feeling? You're so much in love with this one girl, she is your queen, your light and you would give up anything just to make her smile, because you know she deserves it. But you are a poor good for nothing, a rat, you don't deserve to walk on the same ground as her, let alone talking to her. But you can change that. It just needs one guy that offers you and intriguing job. It's easy. You just help out for one night and you make a freaking fortune. At least that was how it was supposed to be.

Let's face it, a bank robbery is anything but difficult in Gotham City. It's like the banks have given up to do shit about it. They practically hand over they key to the safe and you just have to step in and take what you desire. If only there wasn't *him*.

To keep it short, we didn't stand a chance against the bat. He knocked out every single one of us. I hardly escaped but from that point on there was no chance I could go back to a normal life. Until the day I was able to buy my way out of the misery and build a castle of blackmailing and bribery to keep me clean from cops' hands I would have to live in the shadows, keep my head low and make money bit by bit.

All because of her. I don't know what she's up to ever since. I haven't seen her in years, but I have not given up. I still believe in the day we reunite and I can give her all she deserves. For now, I'm in here, in Arkham City, and I have to find a way to get out to fulfill my plan. I don't even know who I was working for right now. I don't know why I am beating up this man in front of my feet. But that doesn't matter any way.

I pick him up from the ground just to land another harsh punch in his stomach. Carl does a roundhouse kick right at his face. What a show-off. But that's just like him. ""Hope you get the message, bastard.""

Suddenly, Jim's phone is ringing.

""Yes? Oh. Sure. Yeah boss no problem, we'll be right there."" He hangs up. ""Alright you fuckers, we gotta move. The boss is planning a big thing. Batman's in here. The boss set up a trap and needs as many men available as possible. We move to the theatre. Carl and I will get sniper rifles. You gonna play the bait, Rick."" I looked at him. ""Sure."" I held no grudge against the bat. But if we actually defeated him, escaping from here would be way easier. We left, the man we just beat up was still in pain, rolling on the floor.

When I arrived at the scene, a couple of guys had already gathered. The rest of them positioned on the roofs around the theatre, preparing their rifles. I just stood around, not wanting to get in any conversation and just do the job. Suddenly the door from the theatre swings open. I slightly looked up, still in thoughts. Then I saw her. My eyes teared up with small tears. ""Harlene..."", I mumbled. ""Aaaaaaalright you funny faces, Mr. J was absolute clear about his orders. You guys are the bait. Batman will try to come in here, and this is the only entrance. So he will have to get past you aaaand..uuuuh...probably beat some of you up real bad. But that's life okay dokay? While he's busy slamming your faces to the ground, the sniper guys up there will hopefully turn the bats into a swiss cheese! Hahaha. Right-a-roney, I head back inside. Don't disappoint Mr.J or I will get back on you!"" She turned around. I hardly recognized her but I knew it was her. The woman I always longed for. Out of an instinct I yelled ""Harlene!"". She stopped and turned around. She tweaked her eyes and headed over. ""Do I know you?""

These words crushed me. On the other hand, it had been years since we saw the list time. We both changed. Especially her. She was the right hand of the Joker? How? What happened. She used to be one of the most brilliant and cleverest girls I ever knew. She had a freaking PhD as a psychologist. A well-paid job at Arkham...I can't believe she dropped like this. My queen, my love, my princess. She was now right in front of you. Looked me dead in the eye. Then she backed up a few steps. ""Uh. Rick?"" She recognized me. ""Yes...long time no see. How are you?"" She hesitated. It seemed she didn't know how to react. Maybe she didn't wanted to show affection to the minions of her boss?

""What are you doing here?"", she asked. ""Long story Harlene.."" She gave me an angry look. ""It's NOT Harlene any more. I'm Harley Quinn!"" ""Really. Well sorry *Harley*. How come you work for the Joker now?"" She looked at me and started to get a weird look on her face that I never saw before. Her view got blank and she put on a wide smile. ""He's my puddin. My love. He is the only one who appreciates and understands me"", she said in an all lovey-dovey voice. I felt crushed to say the least. She was in love with Gotham's biggest maniac. But I'd show her that there are othere options she can achieve. If only I get the time. At least I knew where she was right now. 

""BATMAN!"" I spinned around just to look at a fist coming my way and punch me right in the face. It felt like a truck just ran back and forth over my face and the next second I hit the ground. ""Harley, where's Joker?"" Batman asked. She looked at me. For a second there I thought I saw a glimpse of worry on her face. Then she turned to Batman. ""Oh B-man! Always early to the party aren't ya? Mr.J is waiting inside, It's not like I would let you pass that easy however. GUYS! NOW!"" She raised her hand and a massive shooting began. Batman ran to take cover in an alley. I managed to get back up and ran for cover as well.

No, I had to take action. I had to defeat Batman to assure Harlene comes out as save as possible of this entire affair. We would manage to get away from the police. But Batman would always be in our back. I grabbed my gun and aimed at the alley. But Batman was gone. I felt a kick in the back and once again fell to the floor. I slided a bit, right at the feet of my lovely Harlene. She looked down. She bowed over me and I felt and smelled her soft breasts right above my head. It made the pain go away for as long as it leasted. 

She picked up my gun and looked around for Batman. Then she picked me up. ""Come on you idiot! This is not over!"" She actually still cares about me. I thougth all these years and here criminal personality had erased the least bit of memory about me. But in there, inside of Harley Quinn, there still was the Harlene I loved so dearly. 

Batman landed right in front of us. The shootings had stopped. I looked up only to see that all of the sniper squad had been rendered harmless. Batman sure is a tough number. Suddenly Batman took a sprint right at our direction. I was frozen I dunno what to do. Then I felt Harlene's hand on my shoulder. I looked behind me. She just smiled. Though it was a smile I had never seen before. ""Sorry!"" she said as cheerish as possible. She pushed me towards the running Batman. I stumbled forward and Batman was forced to slow down. He raised his hand to land a full punch on me again. Then a loud noise. But it drowned in the rush of blood that shot through my head right now. Adrenalin pumping through me. And then the cold and bitter reality of pain that overcame me. I looked down at me. A gaping small hole in my chest. Blood coming out of it relentlessly. Before me, a Batman that was on his knees holding his arm. 

""Gotcha!"", cheered Harley. ""Mr. J's gonna be happy to see that I pruned the wings of the big bad Bat."" She used me. She used me as as a bait, a distraction body. She sacrificed me for one shot at the bat. The bitter thought of what I wasted the last years of my life for ran through my head as I sank down to the ground and buried my head in a puddle. 

You know, they say it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved. I however, would have had a whole different stance on that.

Jordic received special attention as he’d admitted he’d searched the prisoner and must have missed a lock-pick. We’d seen the scratches on the grate’s lock and realised this was how he'd made his escape. 

It was unfortunate, as searching prisoners was Jordic’s one talent.  I hated to think where the prisoner had hidden the pick, especially as we’d taken all his clothing and left him only with some ragged robes. And to be fair, none of us would have wanted to look *there*. Cauis finally dismissed us with an angry grunt and went off to write his report.  

Luckily my shift was up so I got to escape the gloomy mood that had descended over the guards. I took off my cuirass and swapped my leather boots for more comfortable fur shoes, packing everything neatly into my barracks chest. I put my helmet carefully on top of the chest.  I’d been complaining about the fit. The helm wasn’t designed for a short female Nord and kept slipping over my eyes. I‘d tried stuffing it with tundra cotton, but that just resulted in a delicate fall of snowy fluff every time I took it off and you can imagine the fun Jordic had had with that.  

So I’d taken it to Adrienne and she’d fashioned me some soft leather padding stuffed with the cotton, which worked much better.  I patted it affectionately, it may not be perfect but I was still proud to wear it. 
 
It was well dark by the time I headed out of the barracks, along the path behind the Mare. I was glad to see little Lucia no longer camped out behind the Inn. I’d spoken to Danica and she’d promised to find her a more comfortable spot in the temple. A cold dark piece of earth was no place for a child to sleep before her time.

I’d swapped the map to my pants pocket, intending to have a proper look at it over some ale and a baked potato.  When I’d joined the Whiterun guard, I’d thought the barracks far too conveniently located right next to an Inn, expecting it to be overly patronised by my colleagues, but these days they hardly ever went there. 

It wasn’t the food, drink or entertainment that put them off. It was talks-through-his-tankard Sinmir’s constantly going on about what a poor job we did, which unsurprisingly always ended in a brawl. And the Commander didn’t like it if a guard came on watch with blood on his cuirass, no matter whose it was. So he’d banned us from going there to eat or drink while in uniform.  And considering some of them lived in their cuirasses, well they just ended up turning the barracks into their own little tavern, giving me a break from their company when I visited the Mare.

Sinmir was never a problem, as according to Ulberth, he has a mammoth-sized crush on me; one destined to be sadly unrequited. So whenever I’d come in he’d blush red as a snowberry and move to the farthest seat he could find. And if you’ve been in the Mare, you’ll know it ain’t big and he’d end up by Uthgerd. I’d imagine him complaining about the guard and her complaining about the Companions and figure they were Mara-made for each other if only they could see it.

I came round into the square and gave a brief wave to Hrodgar. He stood on watch, motionless as always between Belly’s and Arcadia’s, and nodded slightly. The other guards dismissed Roddy as he always stood in just that one spot, still as a guardian stone. They joked about how he was likely asleep, and one day they’d stick a bucket on his head to prove it.  But I knew he had eyes in the back of his helm, friends in barrow-low places and missed nothing.  He also liked to secretly switch with Jon the Red, not to be confused with Jon the Black, named as to the colour of their hair, who was the same build as Roddy, and bunked down by the gate.  The guards up at my barracks hadn’t worked that one out yet.

I walked into the Mare and Mikael was raucously well into Ragnar the Red.  He swears he's trained in the Bard’s college, but he only seems to know two songs, so I’m not sure I believe it.  He’d tried it on once, (and only once), as I took his sensitive parts in a firm grip, (not the pleasant kind) and asked him how he’d like to share a cell with a dead body for a couple of days. And he has behaved like the gentleman he’s not ever since.

The Inn was full as a bandit’s box and the only free seat was next to Ysolda. I smiled politely and sat down. She smiled politely back. I didn’t know her well and though most talked kindly of her, I’d never warmed to the young woman. And it wasn’t because she was so friendly with the cats who camped down by the bottom gate.  I had nothing against them - they didn’t bother me and I didn’t bother them. No, there was just something odd about her. Most days she wandered aimlessly around the marketplace chatting to the merchants. Maybe she was merely poor and desperate but I felt like she was one skooma slug away from a mad rampage.  

I didn’t want to get the map out in front of her so I just sat and listened to the music.  Saadia came over and was her usual brusque self, looking tired.  I gave her my order.

She’d admitted to me once, on a near empty night in the Inn that she didn’t sleep well, and had troubling things on her mind.  I’d tried to press her, but she’d bustled off when Hulda had called her to clean up some mess. I didn’t know her background, but she had a scar on her face uglier than a skeever’s smile and I wondered how she’d come by it.

As I was now just about the only guard who frequented the place, Hulda insisted on giving me free food. I tried to pay her once but she reckoned I needed to hang on to the pittance I was likely paid and looked skinny as a spriggan anyway.  Between her and Saadia they are pretty good cooks, so I’d be a fool to say no.

I could feel the folded paper through my pocket and was itching to have a good look at it. So I skulled my ale and quickly ate my Eider topped potatoes.  The whole Inn was now singing along to The Age of Aggression and the noise was abysmal. Olfrid was closest to me, waving his empty tankard about and singing something else entirely, the only words I could make out were “maid” and what sounded like “musty”.

I gave my plate one last wipe and slipped out the door, narrowly avoiding getting clobbered by Olfrid. 

The night was a bright one. A moon was large and full above the town, though I couldn’t tell you its name. I still couldn’t tell them apart, a fact my brother had continually teased me about considering *my* name.  I smiled at the thought of Benor and wondered what he was doing right now back in Morthal. Probably hanging around in the guardhouse, hoping they’d give him a job. I’d tried to get him to come with me and join the Whiterun guard, but he was determinedly loyal.

The air outside was cool and fresh; though after my childhood some nights still felt warm in Whiterun.  Not that I missed my home town’s weather; especially the thick grey fog slipping in from the swamp. As a child I’d had nightmares of vampires floating out of the mist, coming to bite me. Luckily I’d grown out of that, though the thought could still give me a shiver.

I was headed to a spot outside, up on the ramparts above the bottom gate. On a good clear night, you could look out over the roll of the plain, past the stables, past the farms and the Western watchtower, and I fancied you could count the toes on a giant by the light of their fire at Sleeping Tree Camp. It was one of my favourite places to sit think late of an evening. Tonight the braziers were stacked high, the moon bright and the sky clear, so I reckoned it would be the perfect place to check out the map.

 “Watch the skies, Luna,” Lorhic said gravelly. He was on duty inside the top gate and his mood was usually more jovial. His jokes about sweet rolls and enchanting swords didn’t bear repeating, but his pranks with cheese wheels and pitchforks were legendary - hence his nickname Loki. But the truth was even *he* was a bit nervy about the possibility of dragons coming back. 

“Not going far Loki, and don’t worry, on a night like this I bet I could see the Greybeards rinsing their robes, never mind a hulking great dragon flying across the sky.”  He muttered under his helmet. “And if I see even a hawk’s *shadow* I will be back in here faster than you can say “Hail Sithis.” I winked and he chuckled opening the gate for me.

The twins were guarding the other side and giggling as usual, so I ignored them and clambered over the wide worn stones to my spot. I sat down cross-legged and fetched the map out of my pocket. I tilted it up towards the bright moon. The charcoal was a little smudged but I could make out many little marks all across Skyrim; from the Reach to the Rift.  Exactly what was marked I had no idea. All I could tell was there were too many for them to be guardian stones. And unless I planned to leave Whiterun and traverse the entire province, I couldn’t see how I was ever going to know.

Oh! And here's Shining Ebony [Part I,](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/19d3uk/shining_ebony_a_tale_of_the_ebony_warrior/) and [Part II](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/19hp32/shining_ebony_part_ii_a_tale_of_the_ebony_warrior/). Remember to give your feedback and ideas for future stories. Now here comes the third part of Siris' story.

But before that, I would like to give a shoutout to Cody, or should I say, /u/Dragonsword, like I promised. He had a very sad story about how Skyrim has impacted his life, and I told him that I would give him a shoutout.

Now, to the story...
______

**Shining Ebony Part III** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

""Aisha! Aisha!"" Siris yelled as he rushed through the crowd of soldiers.

Siris then saw her. She seemed had changed over the years since he left the ship nine years ago. He rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn't imagining her presence.

""Aisha, is that you?""

""Yes it is me, silly,"" she said back.

The two embraced each other as the soldiers cheered even louder than before.
_________

Siris discussed what had happened with Aisha about what had happened over the last nine years in his new, large tent, which was given to him due to the death of Officer Sayid.

""How did you end up here?"" Siris asked.

""Two years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion began their invasion after Hammerfell refused the White-Gold Concordat, as you know. Their ships began sailing on the Abecean and it wasn't safe to sail anymore, so we had to land in Hegathe. A year ago, Hegathe was attacked by the Dominion's navy, but were fended off by the army. After that, the majority of the Redguards were ushered into the army. I felt like it was logical to sign up as well, so here I am. My unit wasn't assigned to the battle at Elinhir, but I heard your name and how you climbed up the ladder and dropped the drawbridge. Pretty heroic I'll say. So, why are you here?""

Siris stood up, and put his hand to his face to hide his tears. 

""What is it?"" Aisha asked.

""They... they killed him.""

""Who?""

""My father... Those damn elves killed my father. That is why I'm here.""

""I... I'm sorry... I didn't know.""

""It's alright. I'll kill them, every last one of them. Enough of that,"" Siris said as he turned back to Aisha, ""How's the Hawk doing.""

""Oh... That scoundrel fell off the crow's nest and died four years ago. It was strange. We don't know if it was suicide, if he tripped, or if he was simply drunk.""

""That's sad. I was looking forward to seeing him again. Poor guy.""

""Yeah, it was pretty traumatic for everyone on board.""

Silian Siallo stepped into the tent.

""Hello, I don't believe we've met,"" Silian said as he walked towards Aisha, I am Silian Siallo, and you are?""

""Aisha.""

""Ah, Aisha. What a coincidence, you being here and all. I've heard many good things about you from Siris' father.""

""He already told me what happened to him,"" Aisha said back.

""It was quite sad. But... it will be fine... There are some things you just can't change no matter how hard you try.""

Siris picked up his blade and started brandishing it.

""His death will not go unanswered,"" he said.

""Siris, now is not the time to lose focus. You have done well in your first battle and have gained a reputation. But, there have been many warriors who have fallen because they couldn't keep themselves together. I've known many of them. I've known Imperials, Nords, even other Blades, who have fallen due to arrogance, selfishness, and seeking vengeance for wrongs done unto them. Not one of these types of people I've met have received a good and noble death. Always look to your father for guidance, but do not seek vengeance, for vengeance shall lead to suffering and agony.""

With that, Silian Siallo walked towards the exit, but before exiting, he turned his head and said,

""By the way Siris, I've heard that shout before.""

And he left Siris' quarters.
________

After that day, Siris was named an officer. Over the course of the next year, Siris showed his valor as the Army of Hammerfell began finding victory throughout the land. A few of the soldiers despised him because of his age and how long he had been in the military, but it was quite obvious that Siris had skill in battle and knowledge of the battlefield. A few soldiers were even bold enough to challenge him to a practice duel, and were subsequently beat to submission one by one.

Aisha stayed by Siris' side. The generals allowed her to fight in his unit. Aisha, with already a year of experience, also proved to be somewhat skilled with a sword. In fact, she would charge into battle dual-wielding scimitars. One time, as Siris' unit was fighting against a small patrol of elves, Siris was fending off two elven swordsmen. He sliced one of their necks with the edge of his shield, but the other brought his sword crashing down to split Siris' helm when Aisha threw a scimitar into the skull of the elf.

""You owe me one,"" she said as she pulled her scimitar from the elf's head.

Silian Siallo also proved to be a fine warrior. He was old, as he had told Siris before, but his skill in the heat of battle was quite apparent. He also watched Siris and sometimes gave advice towards Siris' decisions. 

But, Siris wondered why Silian watched him and advised him. Was it because it was simply a duty of his? Did he promise his father that he would watch over him? Did his father know that he was going to die and he asked Silian to watch over him? These thoughts swelled within Siris' mind as the year pressed on.

After his first year of fighting in Hammerfell's army, Siris had risen to the rank of a captain. The decision was met with some anger and frustration among the other soldiers that could have taken the role, but it seemed Siris had become more than just a strong swordsman, but an inspiration, a hero. He was the Ebony Warrior. The other captains agreed as well as the generals and so Siris was made a captain. The day after this decision was made, however, an elf was seen over the horizon.

This elf walked with four others towards the camp.

*""Only four?""* Siris thought to himself as the rest of the soldiers grabbed their weapons and started moving towards them. Almost instantaneously, the soldiers lowered their weapons, for they were holding a white flag of negotiation. They moved back towards their posts with a look of disappointment in their faces.
________

The generals, commanders, captains and other high ranking officials gathered to hear what this Elven commander and his few bodyguards had to say in a large pavilion.

""I challenge the Ebony Warrior to a duel!"" The Altmer said.

""What purpose do you have for that?"" one of the Redguard captains asked, ""This is a negotiation, not a time to challenge one of our captains to a duel... especially our youngest captain.""

""We believe that that man is a key asset to the war. If this is so, then you'll most likely protect him... Maybe with your life... Maybe not. I'm unsure of you pathetic beings' moral codes. Anyways, sending Khajiit assassins to do the job will most likely not work out well. So, why not just simply do the job myself, me against him, in a completely just way.""

""I can take him,"" Siris answered back, ""just give me a few minutes to wipe his blood on the ground.""

""Siris, you don't have to do this, it's quite foolish really,"" said one of the commanders.

""I am choosing to fight him... I know I can do this.""

""Foolishness and pride will not win you a battle, Siris, but if that's your choice, let him fight the elf.""

Siris and the elven commander were both positioned in a squared arena. This time, however, Siris was given his ebony sword instead of a practice weapon. Siris began to encircle his opponent as he had before with Sayid, but instead, the elf immediately charged at Siris with his sword. 

Siris swung his sword and immediately disarmed the high elf. Before he could strike again, the elf backflipped, conjured a bound sword and said,

""I'm no fan of your army's petty weapons.""

He formed a magical ball of flame in his hand and hurled it towards his opponent. The Ebony Warrior threw himself to the ground to avoid the incoming explosion of fire. He quickly jumped back up as the elf attempted to finish his foe and parried the incoming attack. The two continued to swing their swords and parry each other's attacks. For an elf, he seemed to be able to wield a blade effortlessly.

The Redguards laughed and shouted at the elf for using his magic to help him win the battle as Siris evaded fiery, freezing, and electrical attacks. The elven swordsman's sword dissolved in his hand, and in its place he formed two bound daggers, and began striking at Siris like a snake. Siris parried multiple times, pushed the elf back...

and threw his sword and shield to the ground.

""What!"" yelled the elf, ""What foolishness is this? You do not realize that I can just run up to you and stab your neck?"" He turned towards the army, ""This is what you call hope? You give a boy a powerful position in your army and he can't hold himself together? Will your army give up the cause just like this boy has? Maybe he will pick up his sword... Maybe he will continue to fight, but I will cut him to the ground like the worm he...""

""FUS RO DAH!""

The same wave of energy that had erupted from his mouth constrained the elf to the ground, crushing the elven bones in his body and riddling him with pain. The elf looked up, and said,

""What... What power have you conjured? What magic is this that we have not attained? By the Aldmeri gods... Could it be... the Thu'um?""

Siris grabbed the elf by the collar of his shirt and said, ""What is this Thu'um? What are you talking about?""

The elf looked at him through the visor of his ebony helmet, and laughed,

""Ha... Hah... A powerful voice is nothing compared to the power of the Aldmeri Dominion. We will crush your armies... as we have done with with the Empire and we will take... a hold of your lands. When our general... Telindil, comes for you, your voice will be powerless against him. You have no power here.""

Siris stood up and walked away from the elf who lay crushed on the ground.

""By the way, Siris... since that is your name... I know you... You're the son of that Blade... What was his name... Adrian... Of course. You were lucky we did not find you... Otherwise you would not have enjoyed the last moments of your life... Hehehe... But more to the point... Telindil... Our general... Killed your father...""

Siris turned his head. He walked back towards the elf who lay on the ground. He raised his foot...

And crushed the head of the elf.

The three elves who were protecting the commander rushed into the arena to kill the warrior who had disgraced their commander. Aisha rushed in between the two sides and pointed her scimitars at the elven soldiers.

""Enough,"" Aisha said, ""enough blood has been spilled today, and if you wish to lose your lives as well, I advise you to rush right into my swords. Or... If you would rather keep your lives, go tell your general, Telindil, about what has transpired here. Make your move.""

The elves looked around and saw that there was no way out. They sheathed their weapons and left, and proceeded across the sands back to whence they came.

The soldiers started cheering once again for the Ebony Warrior. Amidst the noise, Siris looked back upon Silian Siallo to see him cheer him on...

Silian merely nodded his head in disapproval... and left the crowd.
________

That is the end of part three! Siris' (or should I say the Ebony Warrior's) story shall continue as long as I'm breathing (and no school related, family related, video-game related, injury related ((especially finger-tip related injuries)), house-cleaning related, mind related, uninspirational moment related, sport related, time training one handed related, spider killing related, or world apocalypse related issues come up).

**Shining Ebony** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

Hammerfell... the beautiful desert province of Tamriel... is the home of the Redguards. They are the proud, dark-skinned warriors who are known to never back down from a fight no matter the circumstances. There is one tale about a notable man that the Redguards have begun to speak of. This man was known as... The Ebony Warrior. This is the story of his trials... The story of his legend.
_____________

The Abecean Sea... Shining, glimmering and splendid. It is a grand jewel of this desert province of Hammerfell. This is where the tale of the Ebony Warrior begins...

""Adrian, your son has arrived.""

""By Akatosh,"" responded Adrian. ""Doctor, are you sure? Can I go see him?""

""That is fine, but the baby is sleeping. Be careful not to wake him up.""

The Redguard, Adrian, approached the door to the room where his newborn son lay. The room rocked slightly, as if swaying to the wind. 

""This ship is no place to raise a son,"" Adrian mumbled to himself.

Adrian touched the door, feeling the wood against the palm of his hand, and slowly pushed the door outwards, seeing the few doctors, his wife, Isra and his newborn son.

""What's his name?"" Isra asked.

Adrian picked up the small child, still fast asleep in his arms.

""Siris,"" he said. ""His name is Siris.""

Isra looked at her husband, then she looked at her son, Siris.

""Take care of him,"" she said. With that, she laid back,

and she died.

""Doctor... Doctor! There's something wrong! What did you do? What happened?!""

""She was dying,"" the doctor responded, ""she was dying going through childbirth and she wouldn't allow us to tell you. We have done everything we could. I'm sure the captain will give his most utter grievances for the loss of your wife... I'm sorry.""

""May she find eternal rest in Sovngarde.""

""Sir, I think you mean...""

""Oh... Forget that I mentioned it.""

Adrian touched the palm of his hand to the forehead of his dead wife, and said,

""Goodbye, Isra.""
_______

""Siris... Siris... Wake up, silly.""

""Uh... Aisha, it's too early. It can't be more than five in the morning,"" responded Siris.

""Well, you know that the kids don't work on Tirdas. We need as much time as we can to explore the ship.""

""Sure, just give me five minutes."" With that, Siris fell back asleep. 

""Uggh! get up silly,"" Aisha said as she pulled the covers off of Siris and pushed him off of his bed. Siris fell to the wooden floor with a *thud*.

""Fine, I'll come,"" said Siris.

Siris dressed and the two snuck as quietly as they could past Siris' sleeping father, which wasn't really necessary since Adrian was such a heavy sleeper, and they went out to the main deck.

Once they were outside, the two ran around the main deck. They played a game of tag and a simple game of hide and seek. Siris pretended to be a slaughterfish and chased Aisha around. Afterwards, they went up to the steering wheel to observe it.

""Hey! What are you two doing!"" yelled the Hawk. The children never remembered his name, since he always stayed up in the crow's nest, so they came up with the name, Hawk, and the name simply stuck with the rest of the crew. He was a nice fellow, and the two sometimes kept him company when he wasn't in the crow's nest.

""We weren't going to touch it,"" said Aisha, ""We were just looking at it. Do you know how it works?"" 

""Frankly, I don't know that myself. I *should* be reporting you two to the captain. But, since you're so adorable, I think I'll let it pass this time. Just don't let me catch you two ten-year-olds near the wheel again. If the ship were to change course, I think I would be banished to Oblivion, or worse... I would have to deal with the captain."" 

The three laughed.

""Don't worry, Hawk,"" Siris said, ""we won't go near it again.""

""Actually, my name's... You know what, that's not really important. Have fun, kids.""

Hawk then scampered up the net to the crow's nest in fear that someone would catch him off his post.

Aisha walked over to the front of the ship. She looked at Siris and said, 

""You know, I don't really get to see the sun rising too much. I'm glad I'll be able to see it with...""

She didn't finish her sentence because she slipped.

""Ahhh!"" She yelled as she fell.

Luckily, Siris grabbed her before she fell down far. He pulled, and pulled and pulled, but his arms didn't seem to be strong enough to pull her up.

""Pull me up!"" she yelled.
 
Siris slowly pulled her up and she grabbed the ledge. Aisha climbed on top of the ship and lay down, panting. 

""Thank you, Siris. Can I ask you a question?""

""Yeah?""

""Can we not talk about this to your father, or my parents?""

""Sure.""

The two then watched as the sun appeared to rise over the sea.

""Land Ho!"" Hawk yelled, ""Stros M'kai lies over the horizon.""

Adrian then appeared from the decks and walked up to Siris, and said to him.

""Siris, we're leaving the ship today.""
___________

A few hours later, the ship docked in the island of Stros M'kai. Adrian and Siris gathered their belongings and prepared to leave the ship.

""Do you really have to go?"" Aisha asked Siris.

""I guess,"" Siris answered, ""My father says that he has enough gold to get us a boat ride to Hammerfell, and carriage to some place called Dragonstar. He said we're living in a house outside the city.""

""Well, I'm sorry you have to go. I guess Hawk can keep me company. Here, I want you to have this.""

Aisha handed Siris a necklace. There was a shell attached to it. The shell was white with several rigid, black stripes.

""Where did this come from?""

""I found it. I found it under one of the barrels the other sailors moved a few days ago. If you wear it, I'll always be with you.""

""Thanks Aisha...  I'll never, ever forget you,"" responded Siris.""

""I won't forget you either,"" Aisha said back.
___________

Adrian and his son moved into a small house on the outskirts of Dragonstar. Every week, Adrian gave money to Siris to spend in the markets of Dragonstar for food and any other supplies needed. When he came back from the markets, he told his father about all of the most recent news. Whenever there was a sandstorm, a raise in the prices in the markets, tales of Wereboars, or even news of the Great War beginning, Siris would always inform his father. 

Every day, Adrian taught Siris the way of the sword and the bow. He taught him how to protect himself in heavy armor, and how to cast a potent paralysis spell. Adrian had protected the ship from several pirate attacks and he always trained himself as well. 

Seven years after Siris and his father left the ship, he returned from the markets with news of the Empire surrendering to the Aldmeri Dominion, and the signing of the White-Gold Concordat. Adrian smashed a bottle of mead, yelling, ""How could they do this! How could our emperor do this to us! We have to continue the fight, not bow down to the elves!""

""Actually, Hammerfell is seceding from the Empire,"" Siris replied, ""we're still at war with them.""

""Well it seems not everything is lost.""

""Do you think I can join the army?""

""No son, it's too dangerous. I know, I want to fight too, but we've got to stay out of it for now. Ive got to watch you as well. It would be what your mother wanted. Right now, we'll let events play out.""

Two years passed, and the Redguard father and son continued to live in the house. One day in the markets, Siris heard a yell. Somebody was calling for someone by their name. Siris followed the yell, for he recognized the name being called. 

It was his own.

The yell came from an older, lightly-skinned Imperial. He certainly wasn't Redguard.

""I'm Siris,"" Siris replied.

""Wait, let me see you,"" the Imperial responded, ""yes, you have your mother's eyes.""

""Wait, how do you know what my mother looks like.""

""I don't have time to explain. I just know that you and your father are in danger. Take this key,""

""Wait.""

""And this sword.""

""What?""

""Now run, run back to your house before it's too late!""

Siris ran and pushed his way through the crowd without looking back at the Imperial. He ran as fast as he could back to his home.

And he saw what had happened.

The house was aflame. Almost everything was gone. Siris readied his sword, but didn't find any living people. He knew immediately who did it though. Five elven bodies lay lifeless on the ground.

""Thalmor,"" Siris said to himself.

He then looked over to his side,

and to his horror,

Saw his father, Adrian, stuck on a pike, and burned.

Siris knelt to the ground and wept. He didn't know what happened, because he woke up hours later on the ground. He got up and looked through the smoldering house. The key he was given had to do something. He looked throughout the house until he found it. An iron trap door took the place of where his father's tiny armory once stood.

Siris used the key and entered a large cavern. There were weapons and shields around, and even statues wearing strange armor sets. He found a large table and a note on top of it. Siris picked it up, and it read,

*Siris... This is your father, Adrian. I know that you've grown up to be a skilled swordsmen, no matter what age you're reading this letter at. If you are reading this letter, however, that means that I'm most likely dead. Maybe you already know, maybe you don't.*

*Son, I must tell you that I was once part of a secret organization. We were once known as... The Blades...*

*We were entrusted with the lives of the Septim emperors. We were to keep them safe from harm. As you know, the time of the Septims have passed. Our purpose is now currently meaningless. However, since the war started, the Thalmor have been hunting us. Many of my friends and colleagues have been slaughtered by those damn elves, and now I most likely am too.*

*Son... Siris... I want you to fight in the war against the Aldmeri Dominion. I want you to avenge me, and I want you to free Hammerfell from the possibility of elven dominion.*

*I love you, Siris.*

*Your loving father,*

*Adrian*

And at the bottom of the note lay three symbols, and the words,

*These are words are written in dragon... They mean Fus... Ro... and Dah.*


Then Siris, with a tear in his eye, looked up and saw a mannequin wearing a helmet, armor, boots, and gauntlets, and a bow and sword placed above it...

...all crafted in Ebony.

So, we hear about a party going down at one of those top tier apartments by    Silversun Strip, so we might as well go have some fun with them, why the hell not ? Little did i know, the night was just starting... Our ""journey"" started at the Purgatory.


We had some drinks already and when we were just about to leave a guy bumps into us and drops some kind of device (biotic amp i guess ?) We thought it would be nice to take it and find it's owner.


A few minutes later when we were already at the door, a rude Batarian guy blocks us saying that ""Aria"" wants to meet us, i had no idea who that was but i follow him anyway only to meet a scary and intimidating Asari (And hot, if i may add). She says: ""You have something that belongs to me."" I show her the device asking if she's talking about that, she nods and threatens me if i don't give it to her.


The guy from the dance floor shows up again and just snatch the device from my hand ! Aria gives me an angry look and i am on my way chasing an unknown dude at the Citadel... It took so long, but we finally found him hitting on a Hanar (Seriously, wtf ?).


We called Aria and she was there as soon as i blinked. She then levitated me using her biotics and gave me a kiss on the cheek (I may be in love). After so much trouble, we were still excited for the party (i heard it was at Commander Shepard's apartment).

 I couldn't believe, i was inside the elevator going to Shepard's ! And then, a Krogan showed up on the comm and just said: ""No"". Just like that the elevator was sent down and we lost the party.

Stormcloak Outpost, Whiterun Hold

Dear Saida:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days - perhaps tomorrow. And lest I should not be able to write you again I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I am no more.

I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how our Nord Way of Life now leans upon the triumph of the Stormcloaks and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Great War. And I am willing - perfectly willing - to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this land, and to pay that debt.

Saida, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence can break; and yet my love of Skyrim comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly with all those chains to the battlefield. The memory of all the blissful moments I have enjoyed with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply grateful to the Nine, that I have enjoyed them for so long. And how hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes and future years, when, Talos willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and see our boys grown up to honorable manhood around us.

If I do not return, my dear Saida, never forget how much I loved you, nor that when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name...

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless, how foolish I have sometimes been!...

But, Oh Saida, if the dead can come back to Nirn and flit unseen around those they love, I shall always be with you, in the brightest day and in the darkest night... always, always. And when the soft breeze fans your cheek, it shall be my breath, or the cool air your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Saida do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again in Sovngarde...

Almost equally disturbing is the fact that, despite not caring about the theft of the car is the fact that they seem to raise holy hell when he almost immediately wrecks the car he just stole. It's almost like the cops just shrug at the theft, so this guy thinks ""That's useful to know. I can steal a car without law enforcement officials trying to arrest or kill me, as long as I don't wreck it... I'M GONNA WRECK IT!""

It's almost instantly after that when he drives into a tree or another car or off a bridge or something.

Now... The Tale of the Ebony Warrior continues.

_______

Once the elven commander's former bodyguards returned from the ""negotiation,"" one of them was sent to inform the general. He entered his tent to see him sitting and writing in a large, wooden desk. His body and face were both shrouded in darkness.

""General Telindil, we've come back with news,""

Without faltering from his current task, and without turning his head, the general said,

""Where is the commander?... Was he victorious?""

""No sir, he was...""

""Figures... I didn't expect him to live... He was so insistent on fighting the Ebony Warrior that it got to him... There is no real loss, however, for we can't have fault in our commanders...""

""It seems the Warrior was able to... um... use a form of magic... with his voice... a shout more than anything.""

Telindil stopped for a moment, but continued writing.

""So the Redguards have mastered the Thu'um?""

""The only Redguard we know of that can do this is this Ebony Warrior. But, there's another thing... He is the son of that Blade you killed.""

""And how does that matter? I've killed more Blades than I can count.""

""He's the son of Adrian.""

Telindil stayed his hand. He dropped his pen, pushed his chair back, stood up, turned his elven body, and stared at the former bodyguard. He was still shrouded in darkness but his eyes shone yellow.

""He taught him the words... The words of power that Adrian escaped with... Give the other commanders my orders...""

Telindil slowly stepped into the light revealing his yellowish face, long, yellowish-brown hair, and a scar streaking from the side of his right eye down his cheek and down to his neck. 

""...Prepare the Horde... we strike tonight.
_________

""Siris, do you remember when I gave you that necklace? You know, the black and white shell."" said Aisha to Siris as they sat atop a rock overlooking the camp during the night.

""Yes, oh! I actually have it here.""

Siris pulled it from under his shirt. He gave it to Aisha and she examined it.

""Wow... It's as beautiful as I remember it. Sure it's still a bit rigid here and there but overall it's just spectacular. I can't believe you kept it this long.""

""Well, this was my way of remembering you. I would never just throw you away.""

Aisha looked at Siris, her eyes sparkled in Secunda's light.
_______

Siris and Aisha entered Siris' tent. Inside stood Silian Siallo, looking down upon a map of Hammerfell.

""Need something?"" Siris asked.

""Yes,"" Silian responded, ""I want to know why you killed the elf.""

""He challenged me. He wanted to see if he could beat me and I proved the poor sod wrong.""

""No Siris, *why* did you kill him?""

Siris turned himself, facing away from the old man, and said,

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""You were going to let him live. I saw that you were walking away. You changed your mind, and you crushed his face. Why... why would you do that?""

""It was a fair fight, and I beat him.""

""No Siris, this was more than a simple fight for you. After he told you that his general killed Adrian... your father... You had the utmost desire to kill him. It wasn't your duty to kill him, it was vengeance. I told you that vengeance only brings more suffering.""

Siris turned back towards Silian,

""The elves killed my father!"" he yelled, ""If I could, I would kill every single one of those elves!""

""This is an example of where vengeance will take you. Not *all* Altmer killed your father. I've seen high elves do terrible and wicked things, but this does not mean that the Altmer as a race are terrible. I've known good high elves as well.""

""Siris, I think Silian is right,"" said Aisha, ""The only way we can make amends with the high elves is to forgive each other.""

""Aisha, not now,"" responded Siris.

""Siris, vengeance is not the answer!""

Siris pointed his finger towards the tent's entrance,

""Get out!"" he yelled.

Silian took a deep breath and said,

""*We all come, we all go.*""

""Wait, what?"" Siris asked.

""*we take our place in the course of time.*""

""Who are you! How do you know that verse!""

""Like I said before, Siris, I am your father's friend... and he wanted me to watch over you when he died.""

With that, Silian walked out of the tent.

""He's just trying to help you,"" Aisha said.

""No, there's more to this. He knows too much. He told me that I have my mother's eyes, but he didn't know my mother.""

""Maybe he did, maybe he knew them before your father and mother boarded the ship.""

""But he has to have been on the ship to have known that verse. My father only told it to me once or twice, I'm not sure.""

""Maybe he told it to him sometime while you two were living by Dragonstar. You never know.""

""I just need some time to think... I'll see you later.""

""Alright, I'll see you tomorrow then.""

Aisha left Siris' quarters as well.

Siris looked at the map that Silian had been observing earlier. Nothing of interest lay upon it. He walked around for a moment thinking about the day. 

*""Was it wrong to kill the elf? He would have done the same to me. Of course it wasn't wrong. Those elves killed my father.""*

Siris picked his ebony sword up off his weapon rack and began brandishing it. He saw something in the sword, a speck. He began rubbing at it, trying to get it off. A flaw in the crafting, maybe. Siris rubbed at it even harder. But, the smudge slightly moved. Siris looked closer, and realized what it was.

Siris immediately ducked as a claw came straight for his head. He then sidestepped as another claw came for his torso. It then roared, it's tusks shaking as its large claws spread to each side. Siris stepped back. The creature began to charge and Siris ran toward it, slid on the grass in his tent, and sliced its leg just above its hoof. The creature fell and began squealing as it crawled on the ground. Siris took his sword and plunged it into the head of the creature, and it lay dead.

It was a wereboar. It was a human who has transformed into a massive creature that killed to survive. Its tusks and claws were still as it lay dead.

*""I thought these were only found in High Rock,""* Siris thought to himself.

But then he heard the commotion, and Siris rushed to equip his ebony armor as quickly as he could, and he ran outside. 

He saw what was happening.

The main camp was overrun by lycanthropes of many different kinds. The Redguards and other soldiers of the army were desperately fighting off the creatures. Siris watched as a werewolf jumped atop one of the soldiers and proceeded to tear his insides out. A werebear jumped and crashed into one of the tents, and seconds later, blood splattered across the tarp. A werevulture carried off the Breton Mage that Siris had met at Elinhir, and carried her away from the fight.

A werewolf rushed toward Siris, who blocked its claw attack, but the creature jumped on him, and positioned its mouth to eat Siris' face as drool and slime poured from its lips. Siris pulled his sword from under the beast and stabbed its belly. The werewolf fell dead and rolled off its victim. 

Siris then ran in one direction with only one thought in his mind,

*""Aisha.""*

Siris jumped over a werelion and as it turned its mane to fight its foe, he sliced the monster in the neck and continued to run. 

As Siris approached Aisha's tent, blood splattered across it.

""No!"" Siris yelled as he ran up to the tent, cut the tarp open, and proceeded inside. 

To his surprise, Aisha was in the middle of battle with a werecrocodile. She had just cut its arm off. Siris climbed on the back of the beast and stabbed its neck, ending its life.

""I think we're even now,"" Aisha said.

The two ran outside to face the lycanthropes. 

Another wereboar charged at Aisha, who picked up sand and threw it into its face, dodged, and allowed it to run blindly until it crashed into a tent. She then dismembered a werewolf and cut its chest.

Siris cut the wing off of a werevulture as it attempted to grab his arm, and crushed it with his foot. He then took his bow and shot another werevulture as it was about to rush its beak into another soldier. He then yelled, ""Fus Ro Dah!"" at an incoming werebear.

Three werelions came from around the tents and cornered Siris and Aisha. Aisha pointed her two scimitars at the beasts while Siris formed a paralysis spell in his hand. He shot it at one of the creatures, paralyzing it immediately and sidestepped out of the way of the other creature's attack and stabbed its back. The other werelion pounced on Aisha, and as she was knocked over, she pushed the monster off of her and sliced the head of the cat. Siris walked up to the paralyzed werelion and easily killed it before it could free itself, but all of a sudden, another werelion jumped for Siris' face...

...and Silian Siallo cut its head off.

""I don't mind you killing these things,"" Silian said.

The three then grouped together, back to back, and cut up a werecrocodile, three werewolves, three wereboars, two werebears, and four werevultures. 

The army quickly gathered their numbers and arms and drove the beasts back. The number of lycanthropes quickly diminished. The last werelion in the horde jumped on an unsuspecting victim and quickly killed him. As it prepared to savor its meal, Siris plunged his sword into the beast's neck and ended its life.

The soldiers began cheering...

and the sun began to rise.
_________

That evening, after everything was cleared and the camp inspected, the generals, commanders and captains gathered in the pavilion to discuss what had happened during the night.

""What was that?! One of the generals exclaimed.

""A small army of lycanthropes,"" Siris said back, ""We got them though.""

""I know what lycanthropes are,"" the general replied, ""What I want to know is how did they get sophisticated enough to gather up into an army and attack the camp?""

""Can werecrocodiles even survive in Hammerfell?"" one of the captains asked.

""The Aldmeri Dominion must've been gathering lycanthropes. But how did they get so many?"" inquired one of the commanders.

""They probably kept them all as prisoner and released them on us."" said another commander.

""There must be more to it though,"" said Siris, ""why would they release them all now? Wouldn't it be smarter to use them in a primary battle?""

""It could be just a terror attack. Probably to strike fear into the hearts of our soldiers.

""Anyways, we have many dead and many wounded soldiers,"" said another general, ""We need to bring in supplies, healing potions, cure disease potions, everything we need to make sure lycanthropy doesn't spread throughout the army.""
_______
When the meeting was over, Siris climbed back to the rock that overlooked the camp where he and Aisha had met together the night before. Aisha was there as he predicted. She was just sitting over the edge of the rock, staring at the camp, and yonder at the sands of the desert. Siris sat down next to her.

""Siris... do you want to know the real reason I'm here?"" she asked.

Siris, confused, asked, ""What do you mean? I thought you joined up after the elves attacked Hegathe?""

""No Siris, it's more complicated than that.""

""What do you mean?""

""While I was living with my parents in Hegathe, I was courted by this dashing Redguard. Well, he was dashing to everybody else... but to me he was a terrible, rude, self-centered pile of dirt. Well, of all the Redguards in Hegathe, *he* decided that he was the right one for me. 

When I became eighteen years of age, he presented my parents with a dowry larger than they could have imagined. You should've seen the look on their faces. Anyways, they ordered me to marry him. The only problem with this though, is that I didn't love him back. In all honesty, I actually thought you would come and rescue me from that bastard, but what were the chances of that happening, hmmm? However, my parents disregarded my request and continued to order me to marry him.

I lost my parents the day I left to join the army. I probably won't see them again as well.... who knows what else these elves will throw at us. They weren't really my parents anymore anyways. All they love now is money and riches. Well... I'm glad you're here, Siris.""

""I'll always be here for you, Aisha. Not even the fires of Oblivion can tear me away from you,"" said Siris.

Aisha leaned her head against Siris' shoulder, and they both watched as the sun set.

Thanks for reading! Remember to give your feedback and your ideas for any stories I might write in the future. 

Siris' story will continue until it is ultimately finished. My prediction is to have the next chapter up by Monday. After that, I plan to have the chapter after that done by Thursday or Wednesday. Once Spring Break hits, I'll have a bit more free time. My family is going on vacation though, so I'll be writing a chapter or two on the way to Florida.

Honestly, I really don't know when the ""Shining Ebony"" series will end, but I have a general idea of how it's going to end.

Anyways, I'll write out Chapter 5 and it should on Reddit sometime before, during or after Monday.

**16th of Sun's Dawn**  
Following the somewhat unfortunate outcome of my encounter with Silda, things have taken a turn for the... well, the unexpected, let us say.  
I had the opportunity to strike up a conversation with Luaffyn, the resident bard at Candlehearth. She is... an *enthusiastic* soul, if not altogether talented. Her extremely brief tenure at the Bard's College is unfortunately all too evident in her performances (her flute playing is particularly painful to the trained ear) and so she was most happy to hear my recommendations for improvements in her fingering and tonguing techniques. In exchange Luaffyn has settled my debt with Elda (the rudest innkeep I have ever encountered) thereby saving me from a night sleeping behind Oengul's forge with the stray cats and other such homeless (and highly fragrant) creatures of Windhelm.  
Unsurprisingly, Luaffyn and I have something of a shared repertoire, and with Elda's permission we intend to install ourselves as a duo in the upstairs reception room of the inn, by way of an opportunity to earn my keep.

**Addendum:** Despite her plainly Dunmer ancestry, Luaffyn seems to be well liked by old and new patrons alike. Our inaugural rendition of *Age of Oppression* had the crowds of ordinarily taciturn (and oft times nakedly intolerant) Stormcloaks waving their tankards in the air and slamming the tables in appreciation.  
We received more tips than either of us had ever seen, and I'm afraid I got quite swept up in the... *euphoria* of it all. Luaffyn's enthusiasm, it would seem, extends *far beyond* her musical stylings. If you take my meaning.  
(Personal note: I must remember to write to Illdi. I hope she is well.)

**25th of Sun's Dawn**  
Today I bid farewell to the city of Windhelm. She has treated me kindly, on the whole, and (by the blessings of the Divines) I leave with a purse endowed with even more gold than I possessed upon arrival.  
I shall be eternally grateful to Luaffyn for her generosity of spirit, her strangely enchanting voice, and her ...*enthusiasm*. We parted on excellent terms, with mutual promises to exchange letters, poems and - some day - to meet again in order to make our sweet music once more.  
Onward to Whiterun!

Well fuck, I'm gonna be locked up with Gothams most infamous and dangerous criminals. But I trust in my lawyer to get me out by the afternoon. 


The hours go by and I hear nothing from him. I'm denied any call to the outside. Not even my family knows where I am. Suddenly shit goes crazy. I manage to keep myself alive in this huge city which is actually a prison. I fly under the radar of guys like Riddler or Two-Face. But what do you know, suddenly this hot chicks kicks in the door looking all hot in her corsage and garter belt, her face painted all gothic. 


*Harley Fucking Quinn* 


She commands her numbnuts of minions to take all the guys in our hose to that weird, fucked up theatre. We're put into that huge theatre hall. Suddenly the light turns on and a guy in a purple suit steps dancing on the stage, horrible backround music.


He greets us, introduces himself as *The Joker* and at this point I really start to worry. How is ths going to end? He declares that we're all part of his minion company now. He asks if anyone has any objections. A moment of silence, and just as I am about to raise my hands this guy does it first. You just hear a bang and that guy falls to the floor. Dead. Joker shot him in the head without hestitation. Your super maniac right there. Now I shut the fuck up. 


I'm placed with a couple of other guys in front of the theatre. We're supposed to guard it. The others ensue in conversation. I'm just staring to the ground, lost in my thoughts how the fuck I got here. But before I can finsih these thoughts a black shadow whooshes above us. We look up but the next second the guy to my left is ripped from the ground and sails sky high. Suddenly the other one gets knocked out and burried beneath a huge black cape. The guy rises and reveals his horns on his masks. *Batman*


Guy 3 and 4 storm towards him only to get knocked out one after another. I'm left alone, facing the man who brought me here. I wanna say ""I'm innocent, I don't wanna hurt you"" or something like that, but somehow my rage about all this being his fault is stronger and all I can say is: ""Fuck you bats!"". He must have taken this as a provocation and with a fast punch he knocks me to the ground. I'm half unconcious, staring into the black sky of Gotham while the rain pours down on me. 


Batman stands above me staring down at me. ""You were in the wrong place, at the wrong time."" Then he leaves.

*June 17th*

*Cats. Lots of cats. Everywhere. I have no clue what logic the Wanderer operates on, but it is surely not of our world. That arena he built. It's for some twisted bloodsport. The darkness of the pit conjures beasts the likes of which I'd hope to never see again. Creepers. Skeletons. Zombies. And these tall, slender, purple eyed demons. He coaxes them into fighting and killing each other. And he stands there, watching with what I can , at best, call maniacal silence... Cats roam the town and monsters feed the pit. What could happen next?*

*June 19th*

*Never ask that question.*


*June 21st* 

*There was a loud clicking noise the other day, and strange letters appeared in the sky. The Wanderer had gone out toward the dunes and later returned with another. Another like him. They wandered the town for a while, opening and closing doors, tinkering with lights. And trading with the other villagers. And something happened.The other one killed the Priest, whom had gone into hysterics at the sight of a second creature like the Wanderer.  Then, they fought. He chased the second one out of the town, and our scouts reported that there was use of fire. There was another loud click and a moment or two of silence before the Wanderer opened the gates and walked back into his home.*

**Shining Ebony Part II** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

Siris looked upon the grave that he had built... that now held the body of his dead father. He held a tear in his eye and put his hand on his heart, looking down at the ground, saying,

""*We all come, we all go.*

*We take our place in the course of time.*

*Each of us, destined to be a hero in his, or her, own way.*

*Each of us, one day called to leave this world,*

*And if Akatosh finds us worthy,*

*We take our place in Sovngarde...*

You told me this a long time ago, father. I was too young to remember it, but somehow, I do. I never understood why you believe in the afterlife of the Nords, but if that was your wish, I wish for your soul to find its way to Sovngarde, and be with my mother for all eternity.""

""I see you were too late.""

Siris recognized the voice. It was the old Imperial that warned him of the Thalmor attack.

Siris grabbed his ebony sword, turned towards the Imperial and pointed the sword towards him.

""Who are you?!"" Siris yelled.

""Calm down, boy,""

""Answer me!""

""Alright, Alright. Keep your voice down. Who knows how many Thalmor agents are scurrying around these parts. My name is Silian Siallo. I am a good friend of your father's... I am a Blade, just like Adrian was.""

""How can I believe you? For all I know you're working with the Thalmor.""

""On your neck and partially hidden in your armor lies a necklace made from a shell which is white with black stripes. Your father told me that this was given to you by a sweet little girl, named Aisha, when you were only ten years of age, right before you left to come to this home on the outskirts of Dragonstar.""

Siris lowered his sword, but did not put it back in its sheath.

""Alright, how did the Thalmor find my father?""

""I am quite unsure, but I do have a theory. This home was the home of another Blade before he was relocated, which explains the cavern underneath what's left of your home. Also, there are spies all throughout Hammerfell. Any elf or even a corrupt soldier could have found this place and reported to the Thalmor.""

""Okay, how did these soldiers get past Hammerfell's armies?""

""It's not as hard as it looks. If the army isn't careful, a small party could easily pass right under their noses. It can sometimes be hard, but not impossible.""

""If you know so much about me and my father, what am I doing now?""

""Well, since you're wearing Adrian's ebony armor set, my guess is that you're going to join Hammerfell's forces and drive out the Thalmor... It's what your father wanted after all. Also, your father also wanted you to take his armor as well. It seems to be a rough fit, but I'm sure you'll grow into it.""

Siris sheathed his sword.

""Siris, you're not the only one joining the war. I'm old, but not too old to fight. The empire has given up on us, but I see that Hammerfell has not. We shall fight and drive the elves out. This is my home now, and I will protect it with my life. Now, Siris, I shall watch you as I have watched your father before you. In the name of Tiber Septim, I shall follow you to the depths of Oblivion if it need be.""

""I shall lend my sword and my strength, until I am called from this world.""
___________
Siris and Silian packed everything that wasn't burned and walked across the sands of Hammerfell. They crossed sandstorms and the Dragontail mountains. The sun shone bright and the winds were harsh. The two pressed on until they reached Skaven.

Skaven is where the Redguards and other natives of Hammerfell gathered to sign up and train for the war. The simple soldiers watched in awe as Siris walked through the crowd, fully clad in Ebony armor.

""Name?"" a Redguard said from the desk.

""Silian Siallo,"" the Imperial said as the Redguard wrote it down.

Silian put his arm on Siris' shoulder and said to him,

""Good luck.""

""Name?"" The Redguard said to Siris this time.

""Siris,"" he answered.

""By the Nine, you're tall,"" the Redguard said back, "" Alright, the camp is just outside Skaven. There are signs all around so it shouldn't be too hard to find. You'll recieve daily rations, an issued set of armor, and a sword or bow depending on your preference. Honestly, I don't even think you need it, seems you're all set.""

Siris followed Silian through Skaven. The most of the houses were stone. Others were made of clay. Many of them seemed to take a square design. The markets were not much like Dragonstar's which were constantly bustling with all kinds of people. The markets here in Skaven seemed to be mostly filled with soldiers. However, Siris remembered his time back at Dragonstar, and the times he spent gathering news to take back to his father. Now he is gone. Siris shed a tear.

Outside Skaven, all the newest recruits gathered together in the middle of the camp. A mid-sized Redguard, clad in steel-plate armor stood in front of the initiates. 

""Attention recruits!"" he yelled, ""I am your commanding officer, Sayid. You are all here because we all don't want to be ruled by the Dominion, by elves of all people... magic wielders and supremacists alike... they need to be taken out of our home! and you all will help do so! There are many soldiers out there right now and I know you want to get into the action, but it is your training that will make you better soldiers than anyone in Hammerfell. Now, as I said before, I am your commanding officer. I don't care if you're a man, or a woman, or a Redguard, Nord, Breton, Khajiit, or any other race, you report to me and no one else, unless they are higher rank than me. Am I clear? 

""Yes sir."" The soldiers yelled in unison. 

""Alright, we'll start off with... Hey, you, over there.""

""Me?"" Siris responded.

""Yes you,"" Sayid said back, ""Is your family incredibly rich or something?""

""No sir, my father's actually...""

""Then how do you have armor as expensive as ebony? That must be worth several thousand septims... You any good with a sword?""

""I've had a bit of practice.""

""Somebody grab two practice swords, don't want anyone to get hurt.""

""Wait, sir, are you sure?""

""What? Are you afraid to show these fine soldiers here how to fight..."" 

Some of the soldiers smirked.

""No sir,"" Siris said as he walked towards Sayid, showing his height as he towered above the height of Sayid.

Two wooden swords were handed to Sayid, who handed a sword to Siris.

""Try not to make a fool of yourself,"" Sayid said to Siris, ""Let's dance, you Ebony Warrior.""

Sayid encircled Siris as Siris encircled Sayid, pointing their blades toward each other.

Sayid moved first and lunged towards Siris, who jumped back and parried the attack. Siris shoved Sayid back and swung his sword. They both swung at each other and blocked each attack made. 

Small wood chips flew through the air as the two continued to hit each other's swords. Sweat coursed down Sayid's neck as he attempted to overpower Siris. He swung his sword over Siris' head, who blocked, held his sword, and pushed back quite harshly, and Sayid fell to the ground. Siris stood over Sayid and pointed his sword to his new officer's chest.

The whole unit started cheering as Sayid refused Siris' help to stand back up and stood back up by himself.

""Quiet!"" He yelled, ""sorry... get to training... I need a moment."" With that, Sayid departed from the unit and headed for his tent.

""I think you'll fit in nicely,"" Silian said to Siris.

The unit trained for three months. The soldiers learned to use the sword and the bow. They learned how to stay calm in the heat of battle and they strengthened themselves through plenty of exercise. They climbed poles and hills and swam in the lakes. Officer Sayid watched Siris closely. No recruit had ever been able to beat him throughout all his years as an officer. After the three months of training, the unit was sent to a camp closer to the border, where the main army camps were located. There they received troubling news.

""Sayid, the elves have taken Elinhir. This gives them access to our border to Skyrim and Cyrodil.""

""Yes Captain, what do you want us to do?""

""Prepare your unit, we take the city back tonight.""
______

""Alright recruits, we are taking Elinhir tonight. Is anyone unsure of what we are doing?"" Sayid asked.

A few hands raised in the air.

""Very well, I'll go over it again and see if you can get it this time. Since this is your first assignment, we're going to be standing farther behind the lines. If ladders go up the walls, you go up as well. Archers will be shooting into the city. If we get inside, be wary of civilians. These are not elves, they're captives. They are citizens of Hammerfell, and we are to protect them. Any armed elf you see is expendable. There will be no elves of high significance. Stay close to your unit, and for the love of Tiber Septim, listen to me. Now, let's move.""
_______

The regiment moved with several other battalions towards Elinhir, where the siege had already begun. Arrows were being sent into the city while fireballs, flashes of lightning, and ice storms flew down from the top of the walls into the Redguard army.

A Khajiit foolishly ran towards the walls, alone, carrying a ladder, and was disintegrated by a thunderbolt.

The army raised their shields and slowly advanced towards the walls.

""Shields aren't going to work well against magic,"" Siris said.

Sayid looked back at him and said, ""Well, Siris, do you have any better ideas?""

Siris looked through the unit. ""Does anyone know how to use wards?!""

""I do,"" said a Breton woman.

""So do we,"" said two Redguards.

""Siris, magic is for cowards. We use sword and shield!"" Sayid said.

""Well, why don't you tell that to the elves, I so am sure they'll listen to you.""

Sayid immediately turned his head and said, ""Alright, let's do this.""

Siris continued, ""Everybody with wards, get in front of the unit. Everybody with a shield, raise it above your heads. Archers, stay in the back and shoot arrows into the city. Make your shots count. You three, take ladders in hand. Now, move forward!""

The new formation began advancing towards the city at a fast pace. Lightning flashed and fire flew straight into the wards. The unit passed the rest of the army and made its way towards the walls. When they approached the walls, the three holding the ladders placed them against the wall. Three others quickly scampered up the ladders before Siris could stop them. Not long after, two frozen bodies came tumbling down, with a steady stream of ashes following. 

As the rest of the army came quickly towards the ladders, Siris jumped up a ladder and started climbing. A fireball came hurtling towards him and he quickly jumped to the next one. He hurried up and took his shield to protect himself from two ice spikes that nearly penetrated him. He jumped back to the other ladder as an arrow came for his back. He quickly jumped onto the wall and rushed up the wall formations as an elf charged up and fired a thunderbolt. He kept climbing until he could go no further, jumped back onto the ladder and came upon the top of the wall.

He jumped over the lightning rune that had been placed by the ladder to trap him, he drew his sword and shield, and he started fighting the elves. The Altmer drew bound swords and came charging towards him. Siris cut them up one by one, and one by one, they fell.

It became easier for the Redguards to climb up the ladders and place new ones by the walls. The parapet was quickly flooded with Redguard soldiers and other forces from Hammerfell.

All of a sudden, a larger elf knocked Siris off his feet. He fell atop his back and looked at the elf who was about to plunge his sword through his chest. The elf was just about to finish the Redguard warrior, when all of a sudden...

...Time had suddenly stood still.

Siris looked around. Nothing was moving, whatsoever. He could not even move himself. He looked around and saw Redguards and Altmer clashing blades and shooting each other with arrows and spells. He saw Silian Siallo parrying an attack. Next, he saw Sayid, falling to an elven blade. The next thing he noticed were strange symbols floating by his face.

*""I've seen these before,""* Siris thought to himself.

Siris then remembered the letter from his father,

*""These words are written in Dragon, they mean Fus, Ro, and Dah.*
*I love you, Siris.*""

The symbols started to to sway, shimmer, and change form. They changed until they formed the words...

*...Force... Balance... Push.*

Time moved again, and as the elf dropped his blade to destroy Siris, Siris breathed in, calmed his mind, and shouted,

""FUS RO DAH!""

A sound fit only for the dragons of old erupted from his mouth, and out poured a wave of massive and peerless energy that engulfed the elf, and sent him thrown across the parapet and off the ledge.

Siris stood back up, and said,

""Thank you, father.""

Siris regained his senses and rushed over to the wall that held the lever for the drawbridge. He pulled it, the drawbridge came down, and hordes of Redguard soldiers flooded into Elinhir, destroying all the Dominion that had taken hold of it. The battle had been won.

As the remaining elves were driven out of Elinhir, Siris stood over the parapet and looked upon the army. The rest of the army looked at Siris. They knew it was him who had won the battle for them. One of the men from his unit shouted,

""Let's hear it for the Ebony Warrior!""

The rest of the army started cheering and chanting,

""Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior!""

And the sun began to rise.
___________

The army continued to cheer Siris, the Ebony Warrior, as he made his way through the camp that morning. In all the noise, he heard somebody call his name.

""Siris! Siris!""

He rushed through the crowd... Because he recognized who that voice belonged to...

It was Aisha.

1373229802.0,24,self.LifeasanNPC,1htjqi,[Minecraft] [Part 1] Loyal,451balloons,30,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1htjqi/minecraft_part_1_loyal/,"I used to run wild on the plains. I used to live unafraid. I used to feel the wind in my mane as I charged, unburdened, through my kingdom with my mares and foals following dutifully behind me. But no longer. It all started when the being, that horrible, freakish creature, came to the plains.

We saw it wandering through the woods to the north of us, stumbling about and killing all the creatures in its wake with only its hands. When I saw it gnaw on the raw flesh of a slain cow, I moved my herd to the river, hoping it would be gone before we returned. It had only drawn closer. I urged my herd towards a shallow cave where we could watch the being from a safe distance. We watched in fearful silence as it turned once in our direction, seeming to listen for our very breathing, before turning and lumbering off towards the eastern village. 

We saw no more of the being for quite some time, and I assumed that my herd and I were safe. Life returned almost to normal. We were sure to stay near the cave, but the being did not return. My scouts saw it from the edge of the village occasionally, but that was not our domain. We could make no sense of the village, and so we did not know that something was wrong until it was too late. 

My son was the first to tell me of the noises coming from the village. There were the normal bustlings we associated with the villagers, but these were different. Different and unnatural. Clicks and clacks could be heard all throughout the village as a dwelling rose from thin air, larger than an entire herd ten times over. The noises grew worse and spread. Soul-rending shrieks and ground-shaking hammering could be heard beneath our hooves, as if the very ground was going to open its maw and swallow us whole. This went on for days, unstopping, until all of a sudden, the noises rang out no more. As we stepped cautiously back out onto the plains from our safe cave, we saw the being on the horizon.

No longer was it a lumbering monstrosity in torn furs. Now, it was bedecked in sheets of shining rock, bluer than the skies, running smoothly right at us with a piece of paper in one hand and a staff of the same blue rock in the other. I went to hide my herd, but I was too slow. It drank some odd colored liquid and ran faster than any villager I have ever seen. It outpaced even me, though it soon slowed directly in front of us. In our confusion, we didn’t notice until too late that it had taken blocks of stone and thrown them high around us, encompassing my entire herd in a space too small to move. It left us there for what seemed like ages before returning. I wish it had not returned at all.

Our only sight for that entire time was the passage of the moon and sun directly over our prison. I was not strong enough to be able to break down the walls, but I was strong enough to be able to jump over them. My family could not and panicked without my presence, so I returned to the cell, too loyal to leave for my own good. The day came when one of the walls was torn down, and there in the doorway was the being.

She makes me stay inside and keeps me busy with cleaning, or fixing old blankets and father’s tunics. She thinks I don’t understand what’s happening, but I already know what it is. 
	
It used to just be the regular monsters we had to be afraid of out in the woods. Things like those nasty nekkers and andregas. The nekkers were the worst, they would wait for little kids like me to get lost in the woods and steal them. We don’t find many kids that have gotten lost in the woods. 
	Now instead of nekkers, there’s a strange man with a bandanna over his eye. Mama said he’s just another bandit trying to attack trade routes near the town, but I thought there wasn’t much being sent on those routes to steal. I asked father and he got really quiet with a sad look on his face. He said the strange man was part of a group of Squirrels or something, and that they had attacked some men father knew. But I shouldn't be worried, father is big and strong and he won’t let anything happen to me or mama. I just wish he was strong enough to get rid of that big river monster.
	
That big monster is part of the reason fathers business has been going so poorly and why trade is so scarce. We had to move out of Flotsam, and father had to sell his store to the city or they’d make him join the army. I’m glad father stayed, even if we do have to live near the woods in our little hut. We’re still a family. Even the river monster can’t take that away. 
	
That monster has been giving the entire town trouble, and commandant Loredo tried to get some of his men to drive it away a few days ago. They haven’t come back yet, but if the river monster didn't get them, the nekkers probably did. I think that’s why the pretty lady with the funny hair is here. I saw her walking up the stairs to the top floor of the inn when I went into town with father yesterday. We were going to get a plow repaired at the nice dwarf’s shop. The dwarf there gives father a better price than most other people because father used to try and help non-humans like them, when we could still afford it. They still treat us nicely, and the one likes to tell me stories of magic and witches, dragons and kings, while the other dwarf works on father’s tools. He once told me about a man he called the White Wolf, who “was a man, but is no more”. The dwarf has a funny way of saying things sometimes. I don’t know why he would say the White Wolf is “no more”, because I've seen him. He’s here, in Flotsam. He’s here to drive the big river monster away. 

Everyone seems to know the White Wolf, but no one knows much about him when I ask them. They tell me he’s dangerous, and to stay out of his way. I don’t think he looks dangerous. He is big and strong, maybe stronger than father. I hope so, because then he can scare away the river monster. 

He comes through our little camp when he goes out into the woods. He always has a stern look on his face, but he never looks mean or angry. I even stopped him on his way out to the woods tonight, because I wanted to ask him something. I want to be big and strong like him, to help fight monsters like the one in the river so mama and father can be happy again, so that father can have his store again. When I stopped him, I saw the necklace that looks like a wolf, the one the dwarf in town said was magic. 

It glowed, like his yellow eyes did under the hood he always wears at night. He looked down at me, eyes and necklace both glowing, but I wasn’t afraid. I just wanted to be strong like him. So I asked, “Can girls be witchers too?”

**Shining Ebony Part X** ^a ^story ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

That night, Siris slept in his tent. He was alone, Arenthia left him to join the army in the final defense. He stirred in his sleep, unsure of why he didn't go with her... why he didn't take the fight to Telindil... the one who held the fate of his best friend's soul in his grasp. He continued to stir in his sleep.  He felt the wind slowly blowing on his face, and he jolted awake.

In front of him stood a blue figure. It was ethereal in appearance and mostly transparent. 

""Who are you?"" Siris asked.

It answered in a ghostly echoey voice, ""Why is it that whenever you ask who someone is, you fail to realize that you've known the person all your life. I am your father.""

""Father?!"" Siris yelled, ""It can't be you! You were killed! I saw you burning on the stake!""

""Indeed, I was killed. But now is not the time to discuss that. Now is the time to discuss you. Your best friend was killed, soul trapped by the one who killed me, and what are you doing? You're running away? Why?""

""I'm, I'm afraid.""

""Siris, you disappoint your father. I watched as you saved Elinhir, defeated a commander of the Aldmeri Dominion, repelled a horde of lycanthropes, fought through a temple of undead, crushed a thousand cliff racers, and attempted to defend Taneth against an army... and you're afraid? Don't be afraid. Carry strength from souls now gone. They won't let you give in.""

""Even if I did change my mind, I wouldn't even be able to get there on time. I have no horse, and the battle will be over by the time I get there.""

""Nonsense,"" Adrian replied, ""My old horse, Bavieca, will get you there. He's long gone, but his spirit will guide you to your destination.""

""Father, I'm not going.""

""Why not?""

""My heart has been crushed to embers.""

Siris father approached his son. He placed his transparent hand on Siris' shoulder, and said,

""Reignite.""

With that, Siris' father slowly disappeared into the darkness of the night.

Then Siris woke up.

He looked around, realizing that it was only a dream. He sat on his bed, stood up, stretched his arms,

and he heard a horse's neigh outside in the dark of the night.
________

Morning was coming. The Redguards and other soldiers of Hammerfell stood atop an enormous sand dune that overlooked the field of sand the two armies would fight on. They watched as the Aldmeri Dominion formed up atop the other sand dune far on the other side of the field. The generals stood in front of the army and looked at how outnumbered they were. They numbered at about six thousand strong. 

This battle was the battle that would decide the fate of Hammerfell. Whether it would be controlled by the Redguards of Hammerfell, or the Aldmeri Dominion. The soldiers readied their weapons to face their enemies.

Telindil stood at the front of his army. 

""Ah, this is what I was looking for at Taneth,"" he said, ""a few actual skeevers to crush instead of a bunch of worms.""

He turned to his soldiers,

""Let's crush them and be on our way, shall we? Kill them all.""

In that instance, everyone, High Elf and Redguard, heard someone shout,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

Unrelenting force purged from the mouth of Siris into the sky as he sat atop the horse, Bavieca, fully clad in his ebony armor. Bavieca seemed to be nearly identical to other horses, except her eyes shone a completely blue hue. A small trail of blue mist also leaked from her eyes. Siris and the horse stood atop a huge sand dune that stood between, to the side of, and overlooked the other two sand dunes. The horse stood ago its hind legs as Siris shouted again,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

Immediately, the Redguard army broke into cheer, chanting,

""Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior!""

Siris rode Bavieca down the dune and towards the Redguard army and took a spot in the front. He spotted a soldier clad in Chitin armor.

""Teldryn Sero? I thought you left?""

""Leave?"" he responded, ""Why would I do that? The war's not over and my family still needs to be avenged. Morrowind can wait a bit longer...""

Siris looked around.

""Where's Silian? Did he escape with you?""

""I don't know. I thought he was with you.""

Arenthia approached Siris' horse wearing her black cloak and hood and stroked its mane.

""So... what happened to the whole *I'm not coming with you* issue?"" she asked.

""Strength. I found the strength I need, and I'm ready to fight.""

Arenthia observed the horse, staring at its shining, blue eyes.

""Where did this beauty come from? I've never seen anything like it, and I've seen all types of horses...""

""General Siris!"" one of the generals shouted, ""I think it's time to end this.""

""I'll see you two on the field,"" Siris said to Arenthia and Teldryn as Bavieca took Siris to a position in front of and facing the Redguard army. 

Siris looked at the whole army. Every Redguard willing to fight for their homes and their families stood to protect it from the Aldmeri Dominion. He saw the looks on many of their faces, as they knew that many of them won't be able to see the light of the next day.

""Soldiers,"" Siris said, ""We've all seen the horror that this war has to offer. We've seen our homes destroyed, and our families killed. We have all had our share of tragedy, due to this war... myself included. But, now we must hold strong. Darkness strikes to blind the strong, but faith will guide our swords. loyal hearts we'll stand as one and fight with shields of hope. No matter what happens today, we will never surrender. We will free Hammerfell. Now fight, stand by my side....""

Siris raised his sword,

""and send them to Oblivion!""

The soldiers broke into cheer as Siris turned his horse around and shouted,

""Charge!""

Bavieca then galloped down the dune as the soldiers shouted and charged into battle.

Several lines of horsemen charged on both sides of Siris and many, many more lines of swordsmen charged behind.

The elves shouted in unison,

""Arctavoy Nou Baune Bala!""

and charged down the dune to face their enemies.

As the seconds quickly ticked by, the two great armies came closer and closer together. When he was close enough, Siris shouted again,

""Fus Ro Dah!"" 

and knocked down parts of the elven front lines as the Redguard horsemen charged into the front lines and began to slaughter the ones who had been momentarily been stunned by the words of power. 

The battle had begun.

Hordes of Redguard and High Elf began tearing each other to pieces using whatever form of weaponry that was available to their side. The sand turned red as blood was spilled all over it. Redguard soldiers were blasted away by shards of ice spewing from the hands of the elves. Others disintegrated from the impact of a properly placed lightning bolt. The Redguards, however, showed superior swordsmanship and strength in melee combat. 

Minutes after the battle had officially started, the elves opened cages that had been transported to the back of their lines. Out of the cages ran feral werewolves who howled and charged down the dune and straight onto the battlefield. The werewolves tore their enemies apart as they fought through the battle.

Siris continued to shout and the unrelenting force knocked elf after elf over on the ground. Many Altmer met their end at the end of his ebony blade as he rode Bavieca through the battlefield. 

Arenthia suddenly jumped atop Bavieca's back behind Siris and grabbed her bow. She shot arrow after arrow into the hearts and neck of her enemies. As the horse ran by a werewolf, Arenthia stood up, jumped off the horse, and grabbed the werewolf by its neck. As the beast struggled to attempt to throw the wood elf off of it, Arenthia stabbed its hand with a wakizashi. The creature howled in pain and as Arenthia swung in the air due to the werewolf swinging its head around. She quickly gained gained a hold on the creature's neck and stabbed it, killing it instantly. 

Arenthia jumped off as the werewolf fell to the ground and realized that she was surrounded by Altmer mages and swordsmen. Arenthia knelt to the ground as the soldiers slowly caved in on her. Within seconds, she stood back up and four knives came from both of her hands, and plunged straight into the necks of four of the elves. She threw two more into the hearts of two more as two of them lunged at her. She drew her wakizashi, blocked the attack from the elf in front of her, and stabbed his chest, then she quickly turned around, slicing the other's neck as her cloak swayed in the air. She threw another knife into the last one who approached from the side.

Teldryn Sero, who was close by, conjured a Flame Atronach from the planes of Oblivion to fire bolts of fire at the elven army. Teldryn, himself, cast firebolts into his foes and watched as they burned. The Atronach turned and fired a bolt of fire t Teldryn. It did not hit him, but it instead burned the face of the elf who was about to stab Teldryn in the back.

Siris fought off the elves atop Bavieca until, all of a sudden, 

Telindil, who still stood atop the dune, fired a dual-casted incineration firebolt from his position into the side of the faithful horse, Bavieca. Siris fell off Bavieca as she fell to the ground, dead. 

Siris watched as Bavieca dissolved into a blue mist and disappeared.

Siris stood up and looked towards the figure of Telindil standing atop the dune. He watched as he shouted into the air...

""Strun, Bah Qo!""

Immediately, the sun disappeared behind a horde of black clouds that overtook the skies. Rain poured and lightning struck the ground.

""He... he can shout?!"" Siris asked to himself.

Siris watched as Telindil walked down the dune towards the battling armies. He began swinging his arms slowly, as he had done in Taneth, only instead of fire, lightning formed  in his hands. Telindil pushed his hands out, and an enormous stream of blasting lightning poured out of his hands. The lightning immediately disintegrated whatever it touched and large heaps of ashes began falling upon the sand.

Siris approached the High Elf, who turned his gaze upon the Ebony Warrior. He turned towards Siris, and fired the lightning storm at him.

Siris held his shield up to hold out against the storm. It pressed on, and he felt his shield weakening as Telindil smiled. As he felt his strength weaken, he reached for the shell that was given to him by Aisha eleven years before with his free hand. As he held on, he found strength. This strength turned into resistance and he felt himself become resistant to the destructive nature of the lightning.

Telindil stopped with an angry look on his face. He reached into his robes and pulled out a black soul gem.

""No!"" Siris yelled as he held his hand out.

As Telindil was about to touch the soul gem to his sword, trapping its power and sending the soul to the Soul Cairn, an arrow flew through the air. It pierced the soul gem, breaking it into pieces. Aisha's soul was free. Telindil turned to his side to see Arenthia wielding the bow that fired the arrow. She unsheathed her wakizashis as a large group of elven soldiers charged at Siris to distract him.

Telindil held his arms out, and a magical anomaly swirled around him, and a set of mystical armor formed over his robes. He held his hand out and the same thing happened as a sword formed in his hand. Arenthia pointed one of her swords at Telindil.   She pulled down her mask and said,

""You... Telindil... It was your kind that forced my people to fight for you, threatening to destroy them...""

""Foolish Bosmer,"" responded Telindil, ""your kind are dogs... and I'll put you down like one.""

""I do not care whether or not I die this day... Just know that my people will always resist you, even if they are forced fight for you. I will defeat you, or I will die trying."" 

Arenthia pulled her mask back up and ran towards Telindil who fired fireball after fireball at her as she dodged them. When she approached him, she jumped over him to attempt to strike his back. Telindil, however turned and blocked her and they swung their swords at each other.

Siris fought off elf after elf, and even a werewolf, trying to get to Telindil as he fought the Wood Elf, Arenthia.

Arenthia jumped back and threw knives toward Telindil who impeded their approach by swatting them out of the air with his sword. Arenthia ran towards Telindil again and jumped at him. Telindil backhanded Arenthia with his free hand. Arenthia crashed on the sand. Her face was burned. She reached for her sword as Telindil kicked it away from her reach. He grabbed her by the neck and lifted her up.

Siris had finished off the last elf that was in his way and was running toward the two.

""Arenthia!"" Siris yelled.

Telindil looked into Arenthia's eyes as she realized her impending doom. She looked him in the eyes in return and said,

""You can kill me, but my people will one day be free..."" and she looked up and yelled, ""Goodbye, Siris!""

Without a word, Telindil plunged his sword into Arenthia's heart as a loud blast of thunder roared from the storm, and threw her broken corpse onto the ground.

Siris approached behind them with a tear in his eye and Telindil turned around and said,

""Ah, you've finally come to meet your end? But you must be wondering how I used the Thu'um. Yes, it has taken a long, long while to learn that one shout, but the outcome of it has been very rewarding. I was even told one of the words of it were impossible to reach, hidden in some magical place above the sky, I hear. That didn't stop me from figuring it out, though.""

""It's time for you to face justice,"" Siris answered as he heard soldiers shouting about victory.

Telindil burst out laughing.

It's been 2 months since the rebellion was put down and the Legion have finally decided to let me return to Whiterun. I've enlisted with the guards and have been assigned to patrol at Honningbrew Meadery. It's not so bad , but I swear I've seen movement near White River Watch despite assurances from Commander Caius that the Thane eradicated Hajvaar Iron-Hand and his group of bandits.

15th of First Seed 4E202

Had to kill a pack of wolves attacking Wilmuth at Chillfurrow Farm. Poor man barely made it out alive. Me and Hoki took him to the sisters at the Temple of Kynareth. It's bad enough with wolves outside on the tundra, but I've got to keep my eyes open. Damn dragon's could swoop down at any time.

16th of First Seed 4E202

I was right. White River Watch is inhabited. Ok it isn't Hajvaar, but damn sabercats. One has come down and is just sat across the bridge from the road-signs. Caius told me to keep an eye on it and to not hesitate if it comes to attack the villagers.

19th of First Seed 4E202

Cat has been there 3 days and not moving. I daren't check if it alive or not, don't want to catch Witbane.

20th of First Seed 4E202

Kynareth save me. The ""Dragonborn"" came from Riverwood and tried to kill the cat. Nords should stick with an axe, not arrows and bows. He failed miserably, his corpse is drifting down the White River as I write this. The cat got me as well, I managed to escape for now.

Over that span of time, it's pretty obvious I'm in hell. For one, we have a frozen woman in one of the warehouses. There's that creepy guy who calls people on the old payphones, and anyone who answers either disappears or shows up in pieces later. And of course, there's Joker making constant intercom announcements. I used to think working for the Joker would be awesome. The guy's gone toe to toe with the Bats for years, and all the other criminals fear him. I thought if I joined up with Joker, no one would mess with me.

'Course, I didn't find out 'til later the guy was dying. He sounded hoarse over the intercom at first, but as the days have gone by, he sounds like my Dad did when I tried chokin' him with some old stockings.

And sometimes the Joker gets bored if we haven't found any of Penguin's or Two-Face's guys in a while, so he just starts picking us out at random and killing us! He's insane! I mean, I know he is, but - look. That ain't even the crazy part yet.

I was walkin' by one of them weird glowing question-marks, and then I started getting cold. Like colder than I already am, which is gotta be some sorta record. Then my vision gets all blurry, and stuff starts tiltin' from side to side. At this point, I'm struggling to walk over to my buddies, but I'm too terrified to move, like I'm afraid the ground's gonna swallow me if I take another step. I try calling out to them, but no words come out! Instead, I start puking beetles! I just keep vomiting all of these beetles. Must've been hundreds of 'em!

I turn, thinkin' at this point, I'll just take my chances in the river. If I die, it wouldn't be so bad, I think. I'm crawling over to the side, now sweating like a stuck pig. My fingers just reach the edge when this hooded guy rises out of it. I dunno who he is, but he gave this vibe like he was a demon. His eyes were glowing yellow, and he had a hangman's noose around his neck. He just started laughing hysterically like a screechy little girl. I wanted to shut him up, but I was still hot and puking up insects. Then he pulled off his hood, and he looked like my dad!

That's when I passed out.

Now I'm awake in here. I don't know where I am, but there's no outside light comin' in. I can see everything around me, but I can't move. There's lit-up boxes full of roaches. It's like some kinda weird lava-lamp effect. It smells like a combination of a barn and old pipes. I just want to go home. Take me to Bludhaven. Hell, take me back to old Arkham. I'm sorry, Daddy. I didn't - 

There's someone above me. I can hear him moving up there.  . . . There's some sort of electronic, computer noise . . .

Firstly there was me, Lance Corporal Cuthbertson.  Fresh recruit into the Royal Canadian Engineers, First Army.  Basically I knew how to fill up sandbags, set up mines, and smack dints out of jeeps.  Then there was Lance Corporal Billings, even fresher than I was.  He never spoke much and I never spoke to him.  Sargeant Frank was the most veteraned guy in the squad.  He'd been in the fight for two years and never complained.  He could take apart a tank and put it back together again with the number of Shermans he'd fixed up.  Finally there was Caporal Lessard, the damn Frenchie with the P.I.A.T, an anti-tank weapon.  We also had the grace of having the highest officer to ncm ratio in the front lines with Captain Hamilton and Lieutenant Davidson as our officers.  The lieutenant was always with us but the captain was thrown on because of the lack of infantry in the region.  We were literally it, the rest of the manpower was put towards the seven twenty-five pounders that had been set up at HQ.

Anyway one day we were headed to a mortar pit that had been set up at a steel mill early on so it could lay offensive fire in a relatively hot zone.  Over the last few hours the area had been shot to shit and we were being sent in to fix it up.  When we arrived Billings went around a corner and got hit by a sniper, just like that.  Command hadn't set up any field hospitals, and none of us had any experience giving field dressing.  Or the equipment to do so.  He was fucked.  We left him behind, and as Lessard fired the P.I.A.T towards the sniper we all booked it around the other side of the building to get to the mortar pit.

We sat around the mortar pit for what seemed like days; filling up sandbags and fixing the sights on the mortar.  Random mortars and tank shells landed around us persistently, but none ever hit.  Our day got interrupted as a Bren Carrier showed up from Command with orders for the captain to hop in.  He was assigned to a suicide mission.  The Bren Carrier and Hamilton were to sneak wide around enemy lines so the captain could light some flares by the enemy HQ and fuck with their field comms.  A ""victor target"" they called it, but suicide is more apt a name.  

The Bren Carrier was a relatively big target in the area, which attracted a lot of fire from some jerries and the lieutenant took one in the arm.  We pulled back into a nearby building, dragging the lieutenant with us until we reached the roof.  We didn't notice the captain didn't come with us until we saw the Bren Carrier driving off into the distance with Hamilton covering the rear with pistol in hand.

Half an hour later we saw green smoke billowing on the horizon, then booms from the north, and a few moments later explosions to the south.  It was an amazing fireworks show, and the jerries sure as hell enjoyed it as they surrendered a few minutes after.  We never saw the captain again, but I'll remember his tale until the day I die.

""Siris!"" Arenthia yelled, ""get everybody out! The gates have been opened!"" 

""Abandon the wall!"" Siris yelled, ""Aisha! Take as many people as you can and get out!""

""Not without you!"" Aisha shouted as she rushed back to Siris, ""What are you doing!"" 

Siris took off his helmet, reached for Aisha's hand, grabbed it softly, and held it to his heart.

""I can't lose you to these elves..."" Siris said softly, ""I can't lose you the way I lost my father. I want you to take as many people as you can and guide them away from here.  I need you stay strong... and I'll see you again.""

Siris then placed his helmet back on his head as Aisha ran to gather as many civilians as she could. Arenthia swung back to Siris on her rope.

""Arenthia, you need to get out of here.""

""No, I'm in charge of this city, and I'll fall with it,"" she said as she started moving towards the gates. 

Siris held her back and said, ""You'll be of no use to Taneth dead. I'll hold them back while you get out.""

""Fine!"" she snapped back, ""but don't blame me if you're killed before you can get out.""

Arenthia jumped off the wall and within seconds she was swinging on another rope, away from the gates.

Siris looked toward the gates, turned his head slightly and said,

""Silian, Teldryn... Let's go.""

""Now if it's all the same to you,"" Teldryn remarked, ""I think I would rather get out with the civilians.""

Siris turned around and faced Teldryn.

""Or... I can ummm... go with you then. But if things get out of hand, don't expect me to stay around much longer.""

""Silian, are you coming?""

""Oh, so he gets a say in this?""

Silian looked at Siris. He slowly blinked as he said,

""As long as you fight... I shall fight by your side.""

Siris nodded his head. The three gathered all the soldiers they could find that would still fight and marched through the burning city. Civilians everywhere ran for their lives as their homes burned. 

""They're killing everyone!"" an Altmer civilian screamed, ""Run! Run while you can! I knew I should've stayed in Cyrodil!""

They were killing everyone. Civilians were slaughtered as the Dominion charged through Taneth. Because of the actions of one traitor, a city had fallen.

Siris and his loyal soldiers fought their way through this betrayed city. Ice storms brewed and lightning struck everywhere before Siris' eyes. As they made their way through, they made sure as many civilians escaped as possible. The sun began to set and the fire illuminated in the darkness of the night.

After fighting through the city, the small army of about four hundred came to the center of the city. There were no civilians left... only a multitude of burning structures, lifeless corpses littering the ground, and ashes.

Within moments, an Altmer came walking out of the shadows of night. His armor set seemed to be of a mystical purple and whitish hue, similar to bound weapons... but much more beautiful, and at the same time, terrifying. The magical helmet revealed his yellowish face, and the scar that streaked down his face.

""Telindil,"" Siris quietly, but sturdily said.

Teldryn held his palm out and formed a ball of magical fire and rolled it around his hand as Telindil's soldiers started to form up around him. Teldryn lifted his arm in front of his face, lighting his Chitin helm in the darkness. He calmed his mind and said,

""Nerevar guide me,""

and he hurled the ball of flame forward and watched as it crashed into the face of one of  Telindil's soldiers.

Immediately, Telindil's soldiers charged towards the small group of soldiers. Telindil himself did not enter the fray, but merely watched as his soldiers and the soldiers of Hammerfell clashed blades. 

Siris and his soldiers held fast. The first wave of elves met a swift end as Siris shouted many of them down and his soldiers slew them all with very few casualties. 

Telindil merely smiled, and sent out another wave. Siris and his soldiers continued to hold their ground and resisted destruction from yet another wave. 

Telindil began to laugh, a horrendous, terrifying, evil laugh. 

""Fools!"" He shouted, ""Why do you try to resist, boy?! Why do you continue to try to resist the inevitable? My army is far superior to yours. Our numbers are far greater! Our magic is far more powerful than your weapons! Your city has been betrayed! How much longer do you think you will hold out?! It doesn't matter how long you resist, because your deaths are inevitable! Don't you see? Hammerfell belongs to the Dominion now. The Altmer shall rule all of Tamriel, and soon... all of Nirn!""

""If you think that we will live under your banner,"" Siris answered, ""think again. Hammerfell will always resist your rule. Your rule will always be met with resistance. Why is this? This is because this is our home! This is my home! and I will die for it!.""

""So be it..."" Telindil said calmly as he turned to his soldiers, ""kill them all."" 

At that moment, a much larger wave of soldiers charged towards Siris and his soldiers. Siris' soldiers slowly began to fall, and as the number of elves began to diminish, a much larger wave took its place. Wave after wave of soldiers charged. 

After several minutes of fighting, Telindil looked at his hand. Slowly, it became bright red, as did his other hand. He began walking towards Siris and his soldiers. As Siris' small army finished off the current wave, Telindil began moving his hands back and forth. Flames enveloped in his hands as he slowly levitated into the air.

""Get back!"" Teldryn yelled.

Telindil swung his arm upward, brought it back down again, and hit the ground with his hand... 

...and a giant blast of fire shot out from under his hand and swarmed Siris and his army...
_________

Siris opened his eyes slowly as he laid on the ground. He looked around to see the dead bodies of many of the Redguard companions he had brought with him to the center of Taneth. He saw several survivors fighting off the elves that were swarming them. He heard a yell,

""Siris! We need to go, now!"" 

""*Teldryn is still alive*,"" he thought to himself, ""*hopefully he'll make it out. But what about Siallo?*"" 

He looked around slowly. He was not able to find Silian anywhere, but his dead body wasn't laying on the ground.

He slowly stood up to find Telindil standing in front of him while the other Altmer finished off those who did not escape.

""Fus Ro Dah!"" Siris shouted.

Immediately, Telindil held up his hand and formed a ward. He watched as the unrelenting force was stopped by his magical shield. He began to laugh.

""I think it's time for you to die with Hammerfell, and be with your father."" Telindil said with a sinister look on his scarred face.

Siris picked his ebony sword and shield up as a sword quickly formed and put itself together around the hand of Telindil. Siris charged at Telindil, as the elf stood still.

Telindil blocked Siris' first attack, blocked his second, blocked his third, and kicked Siris' chest without even so much as scratching his own foot. Siris was knocked back a bit, but charged in again and began swinging at the elf using every skill he had learned over the years. The two swung their swords at each other and blocked each other's attacks with ease. Telindil stepped in and Siris took his head and bashed Telindil's head with his ebony helmet. 

Surprisingly, his helmet did nothing, and in retaliation, Telindil head-butted Siris, and knocked him over. Siris stood back up, holding his sword and shield in his grasp.

Telindil ducked under Siris' strike,

and sliced his leg.

As Siris yelled in pain, Telindil swung his sword again, striking his side,

and watched as he fell to the ground.

Siris laid on the ground, barely moving. He watched as Telindil, the high elf that killed his father, the high elf who was about to completely invade Hammerfell, stood over him, sword in hand. Telindil raised his sword to finish the fight.

But Telindil did not plunge his blade. Someone jumped at Telindil and knocked him away from Siris before he could be killed. This person struck at Telindil with two weapons as Telindil blocked this person's attacks. It was too dark to distinguish this person, but when this person stepped close to a rising gout of flame, the person's face was revealed to Siris.

It was Aisha.

Siris slowly held his hand out to Aisha as she continued to fight the monster known as Telindil. 

Within moments, Telindil gained the upper hand. He knocked one of her scimitars out of her hand and it disappeared in the darkness. Seconds later, he knocked the other sword from her grasp, cast a spell on her with his free hand,

and plunged his sword in her chest. 

When he pulled the weapon out, she dropped to her knees as a blueish-purple force started swirling out of her body. Telindil pulled out a black crystalline object and held it out...

and watched as her soul was absorbed into it as she fell dead.

""No!"" Siris yelled as he regained some of his strength and knocked Telindil to the ground.

Telindil held on to the soul gem, and placed it within a pouch of his. Siris picked up Aisha's dead body, and pointed his sword toward Telindil. Telindil stood back up as he said,

""Ah, but don't worry. I never use my soul gems. I'd rather keep them in my collection.""

The elven soldiers had finished everyone else off and now completely surrounded Siris.

""Now it's your turn,"" Telindil said as he formed the soul-trapping spell in his hand.

All of a sudden, two high elves fell dead. A knife was lodged in each of their throats. Telindil turned and fired a lightning bolt at the dagger that was flying through the air towards his neck, disintegrating it on impact.

A figure wearing a black cloak, swinging on a rope, grabbed Siris as he was holding Aisha's dead body, and carried him away from the elves. They swung through the air and landed atop one of the burning buildings.

""Do you know how lucky we are knowing that rope would've broken with your extra weight!"" Arenthia yelled. ""Also, your armor is heavier than anything I've ever carried! I could've dropped you!""

""Arenthia, I told you to leave..."" Siris said as he knelt by Aisha's body.

""Come on! We don't have time for this! You can't save her! She's already gone!""

Siris picked her dead body up and followed Arenthia out of the burning city.
__________
Siris and Arenthia traveled away from the city. They walked until they reached the location of the army camp. It was deserted as he had expected. They had already gone to fight the Dominion, they just didn't arrive at Taneth in time.

Siris buried Aisha on the cliff-side where they talked day after day. Siris sat near her grave until the morning of the next day. When Arenthia decided the time was right, she approached Siris and said,

""Siris, we need to make our way to the army. The final battle will begin at any time... most likely tomorrow morning. You don't have to come if you don't want to... but... we need you.""

Siris looked back to Arenthia with a tear in his eye and said,

""I'm not going with you.""

Sorry I haven't updated in a while.  As much as I love writing this, I also have to make sure I'm ready for the AP World History exam which comes at the end of the semester... which is coming faster than I can think... Anyways, here's the story! 
________

**Shining Ebony Part VIII** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

""Fus Ro Dah!""

The unrelenting force purged from Siris' mouth and a sound as terrifying as the dragons of old erupted.

Arenthia threw on a black cloak, a hood that mostly covered her forehead, and a mask that covered her mouth. She pulled her bow off her back and signaled a Redguard who then grabbed a horn and blew it. Once the sound of the horn died down, he started to blow it again, but this time, twenty horns started blowing all throughout the city and the entire city of Taneth was filled with the sound of war.

The elven ships sailed swiftly on the sea and quickly reached the shores without effort. The army of the Aldmeri Dominion then slowly withdrew from the ship and moved forward. They quickly flooded the beach as they created one huge formation. Countless waves of elves armored in their standard yellow armor marched forward until they were about three quarters of the way from the beach to Taneth.

""How many do you think there are?"" Aisha asked.

Arenthia walked toward them and looked back towards the army.

""My guess is that there's about ten thousand, if not more.""

""Ten what!?"" Has Taneth ever defended itself against an army this large?""

""None that I know of... We'd better hope that the rest of the army gets here in time.""

""Either way,"" Teldryn said, ""it was an honor to serve with you all.""

""If all else fails,"" Arenthia said, ""there's an escape tunnel out of the city through North Sky Tower in the Northern District. If the gates fall, then everybody goes through there, no questions asked.""

""Quiet, everyone..."" Siris said.

No one else spoke, there was no deed. The elves stood still as their army had completely covered the beach. No one dared to defend it from them. Redguard swordsmen stood by the gates and the walls and archers stood atop the walls and the towers. Soldiers stood by the catapults and waited.

The elven army was composed of many, many elves. The majority wore their standard light elven armor. Very few of them held actual weapons. The vast majority held no weapon, but seemed to be ready to conjure a bow or sword at a moment's notice. In the very front of their lines stood large, steel shields. These weren't standard shields, they were about the size of three Altmer atop each other and were very thick. These shields were also able to roll, providing an excellent means of covering for advancing to the walls. Behind the shields were the swordsmen. These soldiers conjured swords and were more advanced in the Destruction and Alteration schools of magic. Behind them were the archers. These soldiers conjured bows and were more avid in the schools of Conjuration and Illusion. The army was riddled with catapults, ballistas and ladders. 

The quiet continued to permeate through both sides. Arenthia and the archers had previously drawn their bows and were ready to fire. Siris had his ebony bow drawn as well. Siris looked at Silian, and Silian nodded his head slowly as if to tell him something. 

Then... The elves started chanting. It was quiet at first... barely anybody in Taneth could hear it, but it grew louder. They chanted in their native Aldmeri tongues. Nobody in Taneth could understand it. It was probably one of their ancient songs. 

Arenthia held her grasp on the string as a drop of sweat rolled down the side of her neck. She muttered under her breath,

""So it begins... Every one of them will die,""

and she released the string. Her arrow flew through the sky, gracefully, like a hawk swooping from atop a high peak. The arrow zoomed above the giant shields, and struck a tall high elf man in the neck, killing him instantly.

The army of ten thousand roared one word in their elvish tongue... and charged towards the walls in unison. 

Siris yelled, ""For Hammerfell!"" 

He then took a deep breath, and shouted,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

The unrelenting force knocked several of the elves over in their charge, but it merely rocked the shields around.

Arenthia pointed a finger upward, and then pointed it toward the elven army. Immediately, several hundred arrows flew through the air. The arrows came crashing down upon their targets, but the majority of those in the front lines were protected by the shields. 

In retaliation, the archers conjured their bows. They placed an arrow in their bows, pulled back the mystical string, and let a horde of magical arrows fly through the sky.

""Take cover!"" Siris yelled.

Without thinking, almost everybody dropped or hid behind the wall's railing. Everybody who did not react was inevitably killed.

""My knee!"" a Redguard yelled as fell from the top of the wall.

Once the shower of death was over, Arenthia took a special arrow from her belt. She loaded it in her bow and fired it toward one of the nearby towers. A rope was connected to it. Once it stopped, she pulled it to make sure it was secure.

""Keep control of the wall!"" Arenthia yelled to Siris.

Before he could answer, Arenthia jumped off the side of the wall. She swung on the rope, and towards a tower with a defensive catapult atop it. Before long, the catapult which stood on top of it started firing giant rocks towards the army. Siris watched as Arenthia swung from tower to tower, helping those in charge of the catapults to start firing. 

Siris took his ebony bow, and began firing arrows into the army. After only a few moments though, the swordsmen began firing a large variety of destruction spells towards the top of the wall. Fireballs, ice storms, and thunderbolts flew straight towards the defense, and anybody who wasn't paying attention was either cooked to a crisp or frozen in place.

The army of elves was rapidly advancing, much faster than the Redguards were at Elinhir. 

Teldryn attempted to hurl firebolts towards the elves holding the ladders, but they were blocked by the giant shields that seemed to be practically immune to all forms of attack.

Aisha and Silian Siallo stood by Siris. Teldryn looked towards Siris as he fired another firebolt and said,

""If they take the wall, the gates are likely to fall at any moment after.""

Silian drew his katana and said,

""Let's hold the wall then.""

At that moment, a ladder appeared right in front of them and latched itself onto the wall. As an elf came right atop the ladder and was about to jump onto the wall, Siris shouted,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

and the elf was sent flying away from the wall towards his death. Silian and Teldryn immediately cut the ladder away from the wall and sent it falling with the rest of the Altmer atop the ladder. 
Of course, it wasn't over, for more ladders began appearing all across the walls, and the  struggle for the wall had begun. Elven soldiers began swarming atop the walls of Taneth firing spells at their foes and raising the dead soldiers from either side to help them in battle. Siris shouted several groups of Altmer off the wall, but had to limit how often he shouted to prevent himself from accidentally sending his allies plummeting to their deaths.

Siris watched as Aisha slaughtered her foes with the scimitars that she wielded. He knew in his heart that he should not have brought her with him, but was also somewhat relieved knowing that she was fighting by his side. 

The wall was being overcrowded as time went by. Every time he killed one of them, two more took his place. After a short period of time, Siris was completely surrounded. He held his sword and shield fast, ready to destroy as many of them as he could. 

Before the elves could dispatch him, Arenthia appeared swinging on the rope towards Siris. When she jumped off, she threw two knives while she was in the air and killed two of the elves by Siris. Siris started fighting them off as Arenthia rolled on the flat surface and threw two more knives into two elven hearts. She immediately drew two Wakizashis and began slashing and stabbing her foes with graceful skill.

""I told you to keep control of the wall!"" Arenthia yelled.

""Quite easy to do against an army of ten thousand, don't you think?"" Siris responded.

As Arenthia and Siris cleared the area, Aisha and a group of other soldiers carried a cauldron of burning oil and dumped it down several ladders. As they did this, Siris, Arenthia, Teldryn, and Silian cut down the ladders and knocked them off the wall. Aisha and Silian then left to keep control of other parts of the wall.

Siris watched as elven mages threw fire, frost, and lightning walls all over the rocks for their catapults. He watched as a rock covered with lightning flew across the sky and crashed into one of their own catapult towers, destroying it on impact.

Two elves charged at Siris and he bashed one of them with his shield, knocking him over, and blocked the attack from the other's conjured sword. A split-second later, Siris sliced the elf's arm off, slashed his chest vertically, and watched as the elf fell from the wall to his death. The other elf stood up, charged towards Siris, and was brutally stabbed in the chest. Siris then spun around and beheaded the elf with the swing of his sword.

Arenthia was busy rallying the soldiers and making signs and gestures towards the soldiers who apparently already knew what they meant. She ordered soldiers to change positions, fire arrows, and to protect specific parts of the wall. 

""If we continue to hold out,"" Arenthia yelled to Siris, ""Then the army could get here and maybe pitch in a bit. I think they've had enough of a respite... Wait... is that Iman?!""

""Iman?""

""A Redguard noblewoman of House Suda. I'm not sure if that is her or not... I'm not sure... but... What's she doing?!""

They watched as the woman who they presumed to be Iman ran across the walls and ran up the stairs. Arenthia looked at where she was heading...

and she knew what was going on.

Arenthia broke away from Siris and started chasing after the woman. Without thinking, she shot the wall with her rope-arrow and swung to the other part of the wall. She quickly jumped and climbed over stairs and battlements in pursuit of the woman. The woman came to an area protected by two guards.

""Hey! You're not supposed to be up here!"" one of the guards yelled as he walked towards the woman.

Before he could stop her, she drew a dagger, stepped behind the guard, and stabbed him in the back of the neck. Before the other guard could do anything, she grabbed him by the neck and slit his throat.

The woman then saw her goal... a giant lever...

She grabbed the lever...

and Arenthia jumped, grabbed the woman and knocked her to the ground. Before Arenthia could see her face, the woman jumped up and ran away.

Arenthia looked at the lever, but it was too late...

The giant lever had been pulled and broken...

and the gates were opened.

**Shining Ebony Part VII** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

Six months passed. The invasion of the Aldmeri Dominion pressed on, but the army of Hammerfell was able to suppress their assault, and prevented them from taking a foothold on any of the major parts of Hammerfell.

It was at this time when Siris was walking through the camp in the middle of the night, and he heard someone say to him,

""I know who you are... Ebony Warrior.""

The voice came from that of a woman. Siris turned his head and looked upon a stranger wearing a brown cloak who leaned against the side of a tent. The face of this stranger was hidden by a brown hood. 

""You know who I am,"" he replied, ""but who are you.""

""Me... You don't know me...but I'm sure you know of your father's order...""

""You're a Bla...""

""Shhh, I'd rather nobody know who I am, except for you. I don't want to give away my location. Do you have a place where we could speak privately?""

""Yes, follow me.""

Siris led the cloaked stranger to his tent. Immediately after the woman entered, she took  her hood off, revealing her to be a Breton woman no older than Siris. She reached in her sleeve, pulled out a packet, and threw it onto the map on Siris' desk. Siris picked it up, opened it, and said,

""What is this?""

""Your army is lucky I found it... on the Aldmeri envoy that I killed,"" she responded, ""If I didn't catch this, you would have lost the war, and Hammerfell would be under the rule of the Aldmeri Dominion.""

""What... is it?""

The Breton woman grabbed a knife off the desk and stuck it onto the map. The knife was stuck onto one of the cities in the southeastern part of Hammerfell... Taneth.

""Your war is coming to a close... For now.""

Siris began reading the parchment concealed in the packet as she continued.

""Right now, the elven general, Telindil is amassing his forces, not on land, but on sea. His entire army is close to being officially gathered together, and he *will* take Taneth. Once Taneth falls to the Aldmeri Dominion, Telindil's army *will* spread from city to city, forcing them all to surrender.""

""Why haven't the generals seen this?"" Siris asked, ""Why would you show this to me?""

The woman paused for a moment, then she continued,

""Like I said before, I don't want anyone to know who I am. The only reason I can trust you is because your father is a Blade... was a Blade.""

""You know as well?""

""Yes, the news of a Blade's death reaches our ears rather quickly... We need to be on alert more than ever now that the Thalmor are hunting us all. Anyways, I must be off. It was good to meet the Ebony Warrior in person.""

The Blade pulled her hood back over her head, and hastily walked towards the entrance. Before she exited, however, she turned her head and said,

""Before I leave... I want to know... Are you... could you... possibly be... the Dragonborn?""

""What does that mean? What's a Dragonborn?""

""You should know,"" the woman said as she turned back towards Siris, ""the ones with the dragon's blood. Like Emperor Tiber Septim and his line, whom we used to serve. The ones who can learn the shouts of dragons without effort or training. Yes, I know you can use the Voice, it's pretty well known.""

""I know nothing about being this... Dragonborn.""

""Well, I'm not sure if it's even possible... Just a thought. Well, I must take my leave. Goodbye Siris.""

Siris raised his arm.

""Wait, can't you stay in the army? I know that it's not the safest place in the world. But then again, being hunted by Thalmor doesn't sound very safe either.""

""No, I cannot stay. I must continue the search for the one with the Dragon's blood... The Dragonborn.""

""Will I ever see you again?""

The woman thought to herself for a second, then she responded,
""Most likely not, but even I don't know where I'll be in the years to come.""

""Can I at least know your name?""

The woman lifted her hood above her eyes, and looked outside the tent. She turned her head to the left, and then to the right. After being sure there was nobody else around, she placed the hood back on, turned her head towards Siris, and said,

""Delphine,""

and she departed from the tent and entered the darkness of the night.

Siris took a few minutes to recollect himself, then he armed himself with his ebony armor and sword. He grabbed a horn from one of his chests and dashed out of his tent. He ran up to the top of the cliff side that overlooked the camp, where he and Aisha met from time to time. As the sun began to rise, he blew his horn.

_______

""You have called this council together, Siris, now what is this that requires the attention of every single captain, commander, and general?""

Siris pulled out the packet that had been given to him by Delphine and everyone in the council began whispering amongst each other. He stood up, walked over to one of the top generals, and placed it in front of him and walked back to his seat. The general picked it up, opened it, and began reading it.

""The Aldmeri Dominion is going to attack Taneth.""

The council started talking louder.

""Not only that,"" he continued as he kept reading the papers, ""they have gathered all the main forces of the Aldmeri Dominion together to take Taneth, and take all the other cities one by one.""

Siris stood up and said,

""This is where the war ends.""

Siris looked to everyone.

""This is where we gather together and fight the Aldmeri Dominion and take back what belongs to the Redguards! If we don't end it here, Telindil certainly will!""

Another general stood up.

""We're not ready. If Telindil already has his whole army amassed, then we have very little time to gather the rest of the captains, commanders, generals, and all the other soldiers that are positioned all over Hammerfell. If this is truly the end, then we'll need every soldier available.""

""If the Dominion is coming, then we need to send aid to Taneth immediately!"" yelled a commander. 

The entire council stood up and began arguing louder than they had ever before. 

Only Siris sat still, quiet... without speaking. After a few minutes, Siris stood up and yelled,

""I will lead it! I will lead it!""

The council would not grow quiet.

Siris looked up, and shouted,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

and the top of the tent was torn asunder by the power of his unrelenting force. The council immediately silenced.

""I will lead the defense of Taneth,"" Siris calmly said. He hesitated for a moment and then  said,

""Although... I do not lead enough soldiers.""

One of the older generals spoke slowly,

""Well Siris... Go then... to Taneth. Seven, no... Eight hundred strong will follow you to defend Taneth while we ready all our forces. Godspeed, General Siris...""

An older commander stood up immediately, looking at the general, and yelled,

""What! You give Siris the title of general! Preposterous! He's only been in the war for two years! And he's only a boy no older than twenty-one years of age! What does he have besides a shiny armory and a powerful voice!""

The elder general looked at the commander,

""Siris has shown his valor where men would tremble. He has faced the demon of an Altmer without fear and has led soldiers through trouble and strife. Now, he wishes to face an army that may even be more powerful than our whole army. If that's not bravery, I don't know what is. Does anyone else have anything else to say about my decision?""

Nobody else spoke.

""Then it is settled, the Ebony Warrior will defend Taneth until our army is fully prepared and can come to its aid.""

Siris and Aisha sat atop the cliff that overlooked the camp as the sun was setting.

""You know I'm coming with you,"" Aisha said.

Siris looked towards Aisha.

""I was afraid you would say that...""

""Don't worry, I can handle myself. What about Silian? Are you afraid he can't handle himself because he's older?""

""Silian watches over me, not the other way around. I... probably wouldn't even be here if it weren't for him.""

""Well if Silian comes with you, then I come with you. Besides, once this war is over, we could start over, live on Stros M'kai or on another ship.""

Siris stood up and helped Aisha stand up as well.

""Maybe we can, one day... Anyways, you can come... But it will be dangerous,"" Siris said without a serious face.

""I know,"" Aisha said with a laugh. 

""Mind if I interrupt?"" said a voice somewhat close.

Siris and Aisha both looked as Sillian Siallo walked up to the two.

""Do you mind if I speak to Siris alone?""

""No, Aisha doesn't have to...""

""Sure,"" Aisha responded, ""I'll see you tomorrow."" 

Aisha then left the two alone.

""Silian, you've been watching me for two years. You've told me almost everything I need to know. What else could there be?""

""I want to know if you are ready to end this.""

""Of course I am.""

""What I mean is, are you ready to end the life of the one who killed your father, the general Telindil?""

""I don't understand, I thought you were all about forgiveness and no vengeance.""

""I just want you to remember that I want you to know what the right thing to do is... when the time comes.""
_______

The next day, Siris, Silian Siallo, Aisha, Teldryn Sero, and eight hundred capable warriors traveled across the sands of Hammerfell to Taneth. 

Taneth seemed to be more of a fortress than a city. The heavy fortifications and towers made several of the soldiers wonder why the Dominion would start here. It was located about a quarter of a mile away from the sea, which would give the elves plenty of space if they were to take the beach.

Once inside, Siris was greeted by a female Bosmer.

""Greetings, General Siris, or should I say... Ebony Warrior. My name is Arenthia, guardian of Taneth, and yes I was named after the city in Valenwood. Yes, I have heard what your envoys had to say, but is it true? Is the Aldmeri Dominion really going to start their invasion here at Taneth?""

""Yes, it is true,"" Siris replied, ""But may I ask, aren't the Bosmer allied with the Dominion?""

""Allow me to correct you on that. First, the Bosmer were forced to join the Dominion at the threat of death, second, I was born in Hammerfell. I've never been to Valenwood. I advise you to never ask anything like that again.""

""Sorry, but we need to focus on the fortifications. We need to prepare for the attack.""

""Can we get all those who cannot fight out of the city?""

""There's no time, we need all the soldiers possible and they'll be easily spotted by elven spies. Make sure they get to a safe place.""

Arenthia signaled a Redguard who then took off, most likely to make sure everyone who couldn't fight was safe.

""We need to prepare the city for the attack,"" Siris said.
Everyone who was available participated in preparing the city for the attack. Swords were sharpened, arrows were made, bows were tightened, armor was forged and tempered, the gates were fortified, burning oil was produced, archers flooded the towers and the walls, and swordsmen gathered near the gates and atop the walls. When everything was as ready as it could be, Siris, Aisha, Silian, and Teldryn positioned themselves on top of the wall.

""This is no Blacklight,"" Teldryn said, ""but this city does have some sort of grandness to it.""

Arenthia walked up to Siris and said,

""Everything is ready, just shout when you see them... and yes, you know what I mean by *shout.*""

Aisha stood by Siris and they both watched the sea.

""This is it,"" Aisha said to Siris.

""This is the end,"" Siris said in reply.

Siris held Aisha close, but he turned back towards the sea...

For he saw the elven ships sailing over the horizon.

It was near empty as usual. Most Whiterun residents forgot there was another tavern in town, I knew none of the guards patronised it. There was some debate as to why; some said it was because Elrindir was a Bosmer. This seemed unlikely as the guards I knew would call a bandit brother if he had ale to sell.  Roddy said it was the presence of the upstairs tenant, which made much more sense considering Nazeem’s line in condescending comments. I reckoned it was the Dark Elf mercenary in the corner, sitting alone, back to the wall, regarding everyone who walked in with her dungeon-dark stare.


I’m sure Jenassa could have killed the dragon with only that look.  I’d once overheard her say death was her art; which had turned me right around and straight back out of the Hunstman.


Today she was missing from her post. Elrindir had reported she had packed up and left with the Dragonborn, which definitely improved the atmosphere.


Roddy was sitting with his arms folded his own back against the wall and Loki was staring at him like a skeever on skooma. He’d never seen Roddy away from his post, and never ever without his helmet. And it was a sight to see, as Roddy was as fair as the Morning Star, with hair like polished dwarven plate and eyes bluer than a Dartwing. Even his current frown just made him look moodily romantic.


“Loki – stop staring.” I whispered, nudging him gently. Loki still wasn’t talking but now at least he was responsive.


Heric said “So Bally has given permission for the DB to buy Breezeyhome and given ‘Fancy Pants’ Proventus 5000 gold for it?” basically repeating what I had just said. 


“Yes,” I said lifting my goblet of wine. “...and don’t call the Jarl ‘Bally’, Heric.”


“OK, Luna, but the way he sits... Anyway, I don’t understand,” he lowered his voice, “Why would Ball..., the Jarl, let the Dark Brotherhood buy a home in the ‘Run?”


I nearly choked on my drink and the other two looked horrified at Heric.


“Not the Dark Brotherhood, Heric. The Dragon Born, D B, remember when we said we’d call him that?” I shook my head, “Oh never mind.”


“OH!” he said and chuckled, “DB, Dragon – Born. Not Dark - Brotherhood. Ha ha. That’s clever. Better not make that mistake again hey?” he said winking and chugging some more mead.


Roddy looked up the ceiling, muttering something about brains and Oblivion. 


As the Draggers guards told it, just after the dragon died, the escaped prisoner had absorbed some kind of power from it.  And when everyone had heard (and felt) the subsequent shout from the Greybeards it sealed the fact he was the legendary Dragonborn.  And as gossip moves faster through the Guards than Horker through a Hargraven; it was all they were talking about. Most were in awe, especially after the survivors described the sight of the dragon’s soul entering the man - there were pretty glowing lights apparently.  Oh and he could also shout - really loud.


And then we heard, while some of us were out dealing with smoking dead bodies, the Jarl had bestowed the prisoner with Thane status, property rights, and the bloody Axe of Whiterun - not that it had actual blood on it but none of it sat well with me.


This I knew, he was an escaped prisoner, who had bizarrely returned, and he had *helped* with killing the dragon. And four of our own were dead. ‘Absorbing’ souls sounded on the Daedra side of the ledger to me.


I pulled out the map and smoothed it out. I’d had an opportunity to ink it up so the marks and lines stood out. I placed it in the middle of the table, anchoring it with a hefty piece of cheese.


“This is what I was telling you about. This is a copy of the map from the lump of stone the DB, Dragonborn,” I looked at Heric, “had when he was locked up.”


The men leaned closer, and I noticed not only did Roddy look great, but he smelt great too, a mix of lavender, juniper and was that honey? I bit my lip trying not to laugh, imagining him not only guarding Arcadia’s but shopping there too and happily browsing the lotions and potions, in helmet and cuirass. I wondered if she gave him a discount. He gave me a sharp look and I looked innocently at the map.


“What is it?” Loki said softly and we all tried not to look surprised.


“I don’t know,” I said smiling, “I’m pretty sure it is a map of Skyrim with something marked on it and I think it has something to do with the dragons coming back.”


They looked at it again closely, considering.


Minutes passed.


“It’s not the guardian stones,” I said, “There are too many marks.”


“Mmmm.” Roddy murmured, nodding.


Loki turned it a little, obviously thinking hard.


Heric spoke, “It’s the Dragonstone of Legend, with Dragon Burial sites marked all across Skyrim, from the snow capped Velothi Mountains to the rocky Druadach peaks. It came from the dangerous depths of Bleak Falls Barrow, on the hills above Riverwood.” He stated then belched loudly, “Anyone want some more mead, my shout. Shout. Ha ha. Maybe I’m the Dragonborn.  Ha ha.”


We stared at him and obviously thinking we didn’t want more drink, he turned towards the bar. I managed to grab his cuirass and plonk him back in his seat.


“Heric! By all the Gods! What are you talking about?” 


“I heard Farengar going on about it up in Draggers.” He lowered his voice again, “It’s his new best friend. He sleeps with it you know. Hee hee.  I don’t know, I could think of a few better things to sleep with in the ‘Run eh? Ha ha.” He nudged me and winked.


Roddy’s face was in his hands, and Loki was smiling widely.


I said. “Heric, you remember when I told you about this and... and... we um... oh well, never mind. Go bring us another round, and a sweet roll, I really need a sweet roll.”

Part II",MrIrrationalSpock,26,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1a9hp5/skyrim_the_real_story_of_ragnar_the_red_part_ii/,"I asked her time and time again what use she could possibly have with a sellsword when her own skill was so indubitable. Never once got an answer. Matilda really only spoke to give directions, which I normally would have found irritating, however, she had promised twice my original commission. So for the long trek north, I ended up talking to myself a lot. After awhile I realized I was telling myself my own stories. That line about me singing my own praises rose up in my mind suddenly. I stopped mid-story, and said
“huh, Guess I really do sing my own praises.” That got a laugh out of Matilda. First time I’d ever heard the sound, it was a nice laugh really, one I didn’t expect from the stone-faced girl of the caves. 

It was as if she derided herself for that one laugh as if it were a moment of weakness. I couldn’t even get her to specify her directions after that. Given all that time to think gave me a clue as to where we were headed. By my calculations, we had already passed Windhelm, and were headed for Winterhold. I had visited once during my time in the legion – cool city, lots of little magical nuances that arose from having the college nearby. In fact, during my stay there…

Damn. I’m telling my own stories again. 

Anyway, what could a shield maiden like her want in a city like that? I hadn’t seen her use magic once. Not that she would in front of me anyway. Ah well, nothing I could do but wait for the end of the line. 

On account of the easy pace we were taking, we arrived in Winterhold late that evening. I expected something weird to happen, but all we did was check in at the Inn (Separate rooms, of course, bloody glacier of a woman) I was then told to go to sleep. Right. My throat was well to parched from traveling for that. It would be nice to finally have some people who appreciated my stories…

So I stumbled back to my room, after several hours of entertaining the locals. Matilda and some strange hooded fellow sat in the back talking urgently, but I pretended to ignore them. They seemed fairly irritated when I made the bar erupt in laughter, so I made sure to tell all of my most raucous tales. I had the bar rolling fairly quickly. The game grew wearisome after a few hours and a few rounds though. The tense silence of the road up here wore me out too, so I bid a fond farewell to my audience and crashed on the straw cot. 

There have been only three times I’ve woken up in a different place than I fell asleep, and this had to be the freakiest. I was definitely in a cell - a strange one, with ice-covered walls, yet lacking in chill. The ceiling was full of icicles, each one looking less steady than the last. I looked over to the door. Well, I tried to look over to the door. My head wouldn’t move. Neither would my legs. Or my arms. What in Nirn had I gotten myself into?? I lay like that for hours. At least, it felt like hours. You try being paralyzed for a while, and see how good your time perception is. I tried moving my mouth to yell several times. No luck. 

The monotony finally broke when an Altmer in black robes strode confidently in. He looked at the helpless fury in my eyes, and laughed. 
“Calm down my dear talkative Nord. You’ll thank me when I’m through.”
Bloody elves. Always think they know what’s best.  I was hardly in a position to protest, so all I could do was listen to him mutter to himself about my “condition” and the “treatment”. Finally, the elf looked directly at me again, and said, “what I’m about to do may shock you, just remember to never allow your spinal cord to sever.” What the?....

With one swift motion he pulled out a knife, and plunged it deep into my chest

This plan would've gone swimmingly if it wasn't for the douche bag team leader.

As I approached them, as soon as I'm in talking range, the Axew spits a ball of fire at me, but it misses. At the same time, the Pikachu paralyzes me with some lightning attack, and the Archen throws rocks on top of me. In vain, I struggle to fight back, but as I'm paralyzed, I couldn't do much.

In my last ditch effort to escape, barely clinging onto life, I begged, ""Please, take me with you. I just want to get out, that's all I want!""

**15th of Sun's Dawn**  
Success! Well, of a sort.  
My first full day on the streets of Windhelm have yielded a mixed blessing. I shall relate first the good, and then the not so good news of my day.  
The good news: I have encountered my first 'subject'. Going by the mysterious moniker of 'Silda the Unseen', I met her on my very first stroll through the snow-blasted streets. Dark of hair and ragged of garb, when I saw her she was warming her hands over one of the large braziers in main square. She called out to me to ask for mercy in the form of a coin or two. I told her I could do better than that and invited her to join me for a hot breakfast at Candlehearth. She eyed me suspiciously for a moment and then spat at my feet, uttering a string of curses the like of which I have never before heard spill from a woman's mouth. Once I had rectified the misunderstanding and assured her that I was not, in point of fact, attempting to procure her services as a 'woman of the night' (her term for it was rather more... colourful) we got along famously over several bowls of hot oatmeal and some of Nils' hot spiced wine. It transpires that for Silda, being 'Unseen' has for many years also been synonymous with being 'Unheard', and I was therefore blessed with a wealth of information - much of it utterly mundane or so blasphemous as to be unrepeatable - from which I have compiled the tale below.  

&gt;**Silda the Unseen of Windhelm**  
&gt;""Age and lineage unknown, Silda's tale begins with her first memories, those of being carried by horseback up the side of a mountain so terrifyingly tall, so rock-strewn, that it would cause even the sturdiest mount to falter and the most sure-footed guide to stumble from time to time.  
&gt;At the top of that mountain stands a monastery, and within that monastery resides an ancient order of blind priests devoted to the protection and study of those artifacts known as the Elder Scrolls.  
&gt;Silda was one of five children 'gifted' as helpers to the priests from one of the many orphanages in Cyrodiil. In exchange the priests would provide food, clothing and a warm bed, relieving the orphanage of the burden to make room for more foundlings.  
&gt;Fascinated by the rituals and disciplined prayer of her keepers, Silda learned to move silently beside them in order to follow them into the places they kept locked, to see the secret things they did, and to take from them the things she determined they would not miss. Silda soon discovered that the priests were not so pious as to be above keeping the best of the strictly rationed vittles for themselves. She would take the spoils of her silent forays and share them with her fellow orphans. Oft times she was caught (at least in the beginning), and thus she learned to weather a beating as well as any man.  
&gt;For months they toiled at all hours of the day; fetching, carrying, dressing, bathing, guiding and otherwise attending to the needs of the blind priests. In turn the priests fed them, schooled them in letters, even named them (after legends, scholars and - in Silda's case - moths).  
&gt;Silda's memories of the Moth Priests are grown distant with time, yet she clearly recalls the night she earned her nickname, and her curse.  
&gt;She followed her master into his chambers, performed the duties requested of her and then feigned her departure as she had done on countless nights before. Her master then left his chambers, following his memory of the walls and floors, navigating the steps and the slopes. To Silda’s dismay (she had heard tell of a delivery of sweet treats) he passed the locked pantry and continued down the halls, down deep into the depths of the monastery and the mountain itself. Distracted by the tapestries and trinkets whilst her master perused his scrolls, Silda did not hear him rise to leave, and came to find herself locked within a secret chamber, with only the flickering candles and mounds of old scrolls for company. Alone and frightened, Silda distracted herself by examining the scrolls that lay upon her master’s desk. Most were in languages she did not understand comprising symbols she did not even recognise, but there was one… a translation, written in her now sightless master’s uneven script. It told of ancient times, of terrible powers and unparalleled destruction. Silda sounded the words aloud as the priests had taught her, and as she did so she felt the room around her begin to shift and change, saw her own fingers become translucent as they traced the letters upon the page. The very world fell away around her and she fell with it, devoured by pain and lost to all sense of herself.  
&gt;Such visions as she recounts of the hours after she spoke aloud the forbidden words shall not be repeated here by this author, for fear that it should fall into the hands of the young or faint of heart.  
&gt;Upon waking, Silda received the beating of her young life, black and blue and bloodied at the hands, whips and switches of the several priests who discovered her. She did not cry, she said, because now she understood the true meaning of pain, and that true pain could not be inflicted at the hands of blind priests.  
&gt;Her master took pity on her, brought her crusts of bread when she starved in confinement, set her broken bones, and tried to explain the power of the scrolls. ""Some go blind, some go mad. None are ever the same again."" He dampened her brow when one of her wounds festered and she broke a fever. He chided her for her foolishness, following him to the scrollroom, yet treated her with paternal affection the like of which Silda had never known. From guilt, she supposes now. Silda the Unseen, he called her, and the name stuck.  
&gt;Silda claims to have been witness to events that this author has confirmed as taking place more than one hundred years ago. She claims that since that day in the scrollroom her body has not aged a single day, while her mind ages and she grows weary of her unending years on Nirn. Such claims cannot be verified, of course. ""Have pity on an old woman,"" she calls to passers by outside the Palace of the Kings, and it is true that her voice is the thin and broken whinny of a crone. Her black eyes speak of untold hardships, far beyond the mere inconvenience of street life, an unending battle waged upon the unforgiving stones of Windhelm.  
&gt;Whether her tale is true or no, traders and residents pass her by without a glance, going about their business, oblivious.  
&gt;In the eyes of Tamriel, Silda remains Unseen.""  

This I have transcribed into the following verse for future bardic performances, for which I as yet require a tune:

**The Ballad of Silda the Unseen**  
*Unclaimed and unloved, of unheralded birth; the towering Jeralls of Cyrodiil her home,  
From orphanage halls, without cheer, love or mirth; the seeds of a destitute life are sown.*

*From mistress to master, one of five children sold; to the Ancestor Moths ‘til her coming of age,  
Was Silda the silent, and Silda the bold; the catacombs her prison, the caverns her cage.*

*She served her blind masters, her future unclear; she stole from the priests for her sisters and brothers,  
Silda the unworried, Silda without fear; the champion of those without fathers and mothers.*

*Then one fateful day whilst in search of bread (curiosity unchecked and nerve without bound),  
Determined to keep the other children fed, she followed her master down deep underground.*

*Unspeakable darkness and horrors untold, such things as would never have troubled the blind,  
Silda followed in silence and read from the scrolls, leaving her body and master behind.*

*A lifetime of torture in one moment lived, and all from the scrawls on a withering page,  
Her masters did beat her; only one would forgive, and from that moment on her flesh would not age.*

*And now on the cold streets of old Windhelm city, doth Silda the Unseen tread ragged and poor,  
“Have mercy on me, show an old woman pity,” shall echo her cries even now; evermore.*

And so to the bad news: When I came to settle my debts at Candlehearth for the night's accommodation and the hot meal, I discovered that my purse had gone (300 septims!), along with my spare quills, two torchworm-silk handkerchiefs and my tin of Nirnsnuff. Silda too seems to have vanished, and all the city guards did was laugh when I related to them my morning's encounter.  
And so I find myself alone and quite penniless in a strange city.  
The innkeep, a humourless and opportunist wench by the name of Elda Early-Dawn, informs me that I must pay in advance for any subsequent accommodations and sustenance. She has confiscated my room key.  
I am quite at a loss.

After recent unfortunate events in Ivarstead I was glad of a relatively peaceful journey and a very friendly reception, particularly at the Bee and Barb (which, mercifully, DOES NOT have a resident bard, thank the gods).  

In exchange for a nightly performance of the usual alehouse favourites, I have been granted free use of the smallest room in the house as well as breakfast with my Argonian hosts each morning. I have never been in close company with the lizard people before, having taken as gospel (as most Tamriellian children do) campfire tales of their deviousness and cruelty. Keerava was a little suspicious of a new face at first but by lunchtime she was plying me with sweet snacks and telling me of her childhood on the fishing boats of the north. It sounds (to me) a harsh and brutal upbringing; yet Keerava speaks with great affection for the hulking wooden vessels that rocked her to sleep each night, and with an almost misty-eyed nostalgia for the midnight lights of purple and green that bless the skies over the frozen northern seas.  

Having finally unwrapped and examined my hastily gathered belongings (gathered, I regret to add, from a muddy puddle outside the Vilemyr Inn) I must finally accept that - as I feared - the journal entries and songs I wrote between leaving Whiterun and arriving in Riften have been rendered totally unreadable by water damage. Truly it can be no coincidence that one can plainly see both an ASS *and* an ANUS within Bassianus. (How I wish I could have conjured such a witty riposte as I was chased from the Vilemyr in my smallclothes by a madman threatening to kick my ATASS.)  

All of my notes from the hours I spent speaking with the beggar Narfi (a soul sadly engulfed by the madness of grief, but oh what poetic madness), all of my deep and profound thoughts upon returning from my pilgrimage to High Hrothgar, and several unsent letters intended for Windhelm… all have been lost thanks to that blood-headed barbarian. Well… in truth the whole sorry affair can be laid squarely at the feet of the unaccountably aggressive and paranoid frost-maiden Lynly Star-Sung, but it was 'AssAnus' who carried out the beating that still aches my bones, and 'AssAnus' who dragged all of my belongings out into the rain and dumped them unceremoniously into the waterlogged street. Convinced that I was conspiring with Wilhelm to oust her as resident bard, Lynly let it be known about town that I was harbouring unsavoury designs upon the young maiden Fastred. Outrageous! I had spoken to the girl but once, whereupon she begged me to let her have a blow of my whistle. She barely had any notion of which end to put in her mouth, the poor thing. I smiled and gave compliments as would be expected of any city gentleman, and her grateful acceptance of my pointers on technique reminded me once more of Luaffyn and the warm fires of Windhelm. Little did I ever expect to be hearthsick for that forbidding northern city, and yet here I am.  

Ah well. There is little to be gained by sitting here in candlelight and lamenting deeds and friendships past. I am in good health, as is my coinpurse following my successful (if trying) residency teaching lute and entertaining guests at Dragonsreach. I struck up a hearty and interesting conversation with a jovial and most helpful fellow down in the bar earlier, and I believe that together we will be able to organise Riften's first ever outdoor music festival, happily coinciding with a visit to the town by a renowned dignitary from the Reach. This fellow hopes to solicit this dignitary for a small donation from his silver fortune in order to buy winter clothes and musical instruments for the poor children of Honorhall Orphanage. I believe this to be a very worthy cause, one I am happy to support with all my heart and my musical skill. I shall call upon the fellow in question - 'Just ask for Brynjolf', he told me - tomorrow at market.

I made it back just in time and spent a day with my sister in New Vegas, we gambled a bit and drinked some beers in the embassy, It was a celebration not only for a Holiday but a Ranger Squad managed to take out the Legion camp i help spot, It felt.......empowering to tell someone higher than me what to do, I got a promotion, Lt Edward....... has a nice ring to it....

There has been reports of unknown man wearing vault uniforms going around, he supposedly cleared a entire town full crazed criminals with dynamite, He then told someone in the NCR That it was safe, Who ever he was i want to thank him, i was about to be stationed there, not good for my health to be near dynamite, Also the heat here is getting unbearable near all the machinery in Hoover Dam, I wish winter was still a thing, i think nuclear winter is a thing..... i'll have to ask Mr.Fantastic once i get stationed back at Helios, I can tell him my new rank!

In a chair sat a Testificate simply known as Preacher, along with another who was there for an interview. He took out his paper and quill and cleared his throat. ""Mr. Preacher, can you recollect the great battle of Rufus-Haven for me please? I would like to include it in the book im writing about the history of our great city, and it's namesake.
The old and wrinkled man turned his head slowly and spoke. 
""Ahh yes I remember that night well. It was back before the Courthouse was built. Even before the Great Wall, back when we just had a fence protecting us from the monsters."" Preacher shuddered as he closed his eyes to remember that night.
""It was a few nights after the Creator had lain the last of the fence. There were others with us but they fled, in fear the Creator would slay them. The only of us who stayed were Rufus and I."" A smile spread across his face. ""Anyway, as I was saying, After the Creator put down the last fence he created an army of Snow Gollum to help patrol and protect our newly established village. They all performed admirably but one night the monsters attacked our village. The Gollums were quickly overpowered as a couple Creepers blew up the fence and broke the safe barrier. After that skeletons came in and made quick work of the Gollum's The only line of defence we had left was Rufus, for the Creator was down in the mine looking for riches. It was just before sunrise, and Rufus had so far protected the village, but he was quickly growing tired. He looked off in the distance and he saw the thing of myths and legends. What he saw was...was-"" 
Preacher suddenly broke down into a fit of crying. The author took the old man in an embrace to try to comfort him. He had learned in his schooling of the great battle and understood it was a sore subject. 
""I am sorry"" exclaimed Preacher as he wiped a tear from his face. ""I shall continue just give me a moment please."" He blew his nose and got right back into the story, a glassy gaze plastered on his cold face. 
""What was in the distance was whatis a creeper with a strange glowing blue aura, and  is what is now known as a Supercharged Creeper. Short fused and highly dangerous. The Creeper caught sight of the hole in the fence, and also Rufus. Knowing the beast was locked onto him Rufus made the ultimate decision. Quickly I saw him glance up at me through the window and he kissed his finger to his lips then twoard me, our ancient way of saying goodbye. He then ran full sprint and met the Creeper at the fence line. The church shook as the explosion boomed. After the dust and dirt had settled all that was left was a crater. And all I did was just stand here and watch it all happen.""
Preacher shed a single tear, more surely would have pourn if he had not shed them all earlier. 
       A few minutes later the Author left and Preacher was once again alone with his thoughts. He was getting very tired. He went to the window, and looked at the now bustling metropolis the Creator had turned the once small village into, then he looked over at the wall, to the place that was once the crater, and was now the resting place of his old friend.

Same routine as always. I can't even sleep anymore; I just relive the last minutes of my life, the sweet millisecond of death, rinse, repeat. I tried to stop it, multiple times really, but after a while you just stop. All that downtime gives you a lot of time to think, while in pain or not.


If it wasn't for my (failing) internal clock, I wouldn't know what day it is. If my facilities were in check like normal, it would reset along with the rest of my body. But my mind keeps diligently working toward the future. I think of new technologies that would be present if and when I am found by some amateur roboticist, bringing me back with what he has. Maybe my kind has ruled the world. It has been two thousand, seven hundred eighteen years and seventy-six days, you know. Maybe humanity has fallen, maybe it is us. I remember, barely a spark, of another robotic voice, extermination under its breath. Something that one of the workers liked to watch. It's since failed me, since all the televisions started to fail after I did what I did.


And I had to, for the sake of science.


I feel something, a...spark, right as I am killed for the billionth time, instead of getting jerked back, I see...her, and that little blue idiot. I've seen HIM around the facility. He was in charge of the humans. Did a terrible job with that one.

___________________________________________________________

I woke up to the sound of voices. Familiar ones. That was nice. No, wait. There was Rorik… and was that?.... Damn. Matilda. How in Oblivion did she get here so fast? Sitting bolt upright, I leaped out of bed, and stopped. Of course I had to have left my battle gear in the entryway. Pah. No matter. I could probably take their entire forces without any armor. Walking out, I boldly approached the voices. 
“I tell you, I’ve known this man for most of my life, and I’ve never seen him this arrogant! Give up, and let him be. You won’t find your mediator in him anymore. The Change has seen to that.”
“Papa, The Change also increases the good too! It made you more level-headed. It made me more rational. I want to believe that he will eventually be the piece we’re looking for.”

Woah. Matilda was Rorik’s daugher? What kind of a raising did she get, when she thought it was okay to damn near murder people in order to join some sort of crusade. Well one thing’s for sure. They wont manipulate me!

I heard Rorik sigh, and say, “I’ve also never seen that man think himself wrong, or change his mind. He’s as pig-headed as they come, and while it was endearing before, you’ve pushed it past reason now.” Walking in, I said “Damn right I’m not going to change my mind. This little bitch led me to a death trap!” After the brief surprise, Rorik got up, and gave me a right cross to the jaw. After staggering back, I said, “What was that for? A bitch is as a bitch does, and this one led me halfway across Skyrim to have some bloody elf try and gut me!”
Stone-faced, Rorik said, “You still don’t talk about my flesh and blood like that. And besides, you seem to be fine, while there’s a man back in Winterhold with his head and neck separated.”
“I see they’ve fed you with their lies. Your flesh and blood? We’re battle-brothers! And you turn on me now?” I said, outrage at my plight rising.
“Damn it Ragnar! It’s because we’re battle brothers that I recommended you to the Immentia in the first place!”

“Who in Mundus are the Immentia?” I asked. Perhaps it was the name of those bastards who stabbed me. Matilda spoke up for the first time since I entered the room. “Immentia is a group dedicated to working behind the scenes to bring about better governance among Tamriel. We’re very small, but each of us has been gifted, through arts given to our leader by Arkay himself, with near immortality and invulnerability. It is only by decapitation that we can be killed. You were in no danger from the knife.”
“By bloody hands of Stendarr, could you guys at least have warned me??” The more I learned, the more my rage grew. Who were these people to tell me, the best sword arm in Tamriel, what I should be doing? Who were they to give me such a position without asking? Rorik interrupted my mounting fury with a lame excuse: “It’s part of the initiation! You have to be able to obey without question, even if the end is unclear. It’s a test of loyalty.”

“Damn your loyalty, faithless dog! You’re one of them!” Matilda, moving faster than I’d have thought possible, grabbed me by the collar and said,
“I fought for your admittance. I believed my father’s tales of you. I thought you would be the one to bring our plan to fruition, and you betray me. If there’s a faithless dog here, it’s you.” I shoved Matilda off, my rage near it’s apex.  I was about to roar about how I could hardly have shown loyalty to a group that was intent on torturing me, when Rorik interrupted, with a voice as cold and hard as ice-coated ebony, “I think you should leave now, while you still have your one day of freedom.” 

Turning to look at my treacherous friend, I shot him a look of pure hatred, and turned to Matilda, saying, “You know why they call me Ragnar the Red? Because by my sword alone, I made an entire river flow red with blood. Pray to Stendarr when you come for me, bitch.” I then grabbed my armor and stomped out. Some friends they were. I angled myself toward Whiterun, and started the long walk there. As I was leaving, I caught Rorik telling Matilda,
“See, that’s what I’m talking about! He got that nickname because he turned bright red every time a half-way attractive woman said anything to him!”
Filthy Traitor.

The journey to Whiterun was uneventful. I was traveling fast, and nothing wants to mess with me when I’m in a hurry. The guards looked at me a little funny when I walked in. I guess they weren’t used to such esteemed company. As I was parched, and hungry, I took up a spot in the Bannered Mare. Seeing as the Immentia were noble bastards, it was unlikely they’d attack while I was surrounded by other innocents. In the meantime, while the mead was good and the food savoury, I figured I should educated the populace on my heroics. Akatosh knows I never got enough credit for them. 
At first, the people were suitably impressed, but they rapidly became ungrateful of my renown. Ignorant peasants! What did they know of what greatness was? I did my best to educate them, while making sure there wasn’t an overabundance of mead, of course. My throat did tend to get rather dry while explaining my glories. 

By the end of the night, even the bloody innkeeper was ungrateful of my great deeds. I must have saved his life 10 times, and he sits there annoyed I’m trying to get credit for it! Furious, I went to sleep, planning to stay here for a few days, then move on when I’d convinced the locals of my prominence. They’d act as a bodyguard for any of the puny forces the Immentia sent after me. 

The next day passed much like the last. I regaled the crowd all day with tales of my adventures, to the same ungrateful muttering. I’d have to work harder the next day for my plan to work. 

I started slower this time, opening them up with some tales of my legion days, giving what little credit Rorik deserved to him of course. Treacherous leech though he was, he did help in some small way. Then I moved to my greater exploits, hoping to inspire loyalty in the locals. All day, I hammered at them, trying to get them to see the light of the presence they were in. No luck.

Halfway through the evening, A hooded stranger came in. After exchanging a few words with the innkeeper, he sat down. I started in on my next tale, the one of how I personally subdued an entire uprising. A rousing good tale, that one. Suddenly, he took his hood off and stared at me.
Dibella’s bloody breasts, it was Matilda. She stood up, and faced those in the bar, saying, “How many of you have asked this man to leave?” The petulant, ungrateful lot raised their hands in unison, making wild cries of affirmation.
“How many times has given you peace from his hopelessly arrogant self-aggrandizement?” The inn exploded in shouts of how often they’d tried to stop me. Bloody treacherous peasants. Trying to assert my Gods-given dominance, I said in reply “Self-Aggrandizement? Face me in battle you craven whore, and we’ll see how much is made up!” Whirling suddenly, Matilda drew her long, thin sword, and said in a furious voice, “I think it’s high time you bleed for your crimes.”

The Inn grew tense. Slowly, I put on my helmet and drew my axe. 
“Well lass, I hate to end your life early, but you did ask for it.”
With furious speed, she charged. I barely kept pace with the blows, but they would surely yield to my superior experience. I swung my axe in a mighty over-arching blow. I hit air. By the Eight she was fast. I parried again, probing, seeking an opening. There! Swinging with all of my near-godlike might, I aimed at the hole she’d left in her defense. I was grinning with battle adrenaline. Man it would feel good to watch that bi---

It was late and dawn was likely closer than dusk. I could hear the slow breathing of the other guards along with Heric’s usual melodic snoring. I generally hated sleeping in the barracks. I didn’t mind the sharing, but I often felt with the vast hall and quarters of Jorrvaskr bearing down upon us, that one day while we slept we’d all be silently crushed. I liked to sleep where I could see the sky, the stars, the moons and the world outside.


When I was small, and my nightmares kept me from sleep, my father had fashioned a little aerie on the top of our house. He nailed a few flat boards outside the upstairs window, on top of the thatch, with a sturdy rail all around. Benny and I would wrap ourselves in our favourite furs and curl up on the warm wood. Once it was fully dark, Father would lean out, resting his arms on the sill and tell us the tales of the stars; the stories of the 3 Guardians and how the Serpent chased the others around the sky. He’d tell me, high up there with my brother beside me, where if I looked hard I could see all the way to Solitude, how the vampires couldn’t reach me and the Divines would protect us always.  He would tell us how I had been born under the Steed and Benny the Warrior Star, but my favourite story was always the Serpent as it went its own way and followed its own path. 
I really wished I could see it now, to look up into the black and have that familiar comfort of searching the sky for it.

Loki had survived the attack on the tower with only a few burns and slightly singed hair.  He was resting in the temple and his wounds would heal quickly. I wasn’t so sure about his spirit as he had not spoken since he’d returned. Cauis had taken him off the roster.


Hroki and Tor were dead, along with two other guards.


I knew this as the Commander had sent me down to the tower with Anders and Heric to recover the bodies. We borrowed a cart from Severio’s farm, for transport.


When we got there we stopped, staring at the enormous skeleton of the dragon, bones bare and stretched across the scorched ground.  I had seen the skull of the dragon above the throne at Dragonsreach many times, but this took my breath and all my words from me. It was as big as a mammoth and patches of tundra around it were still smouldering.


As we discovered were the two burnt bodies. We weren’t even sure who they were. I cannot describe the smell except to say it was gut-wrenching. Even now with lavender tucked into my clothes and bedding I am afraid it will never leave me.


We found Tor’s body lying peacefully on the cobbles. He was recognisable, completely intact, his helmet still on, covering his face. There was very little blood but every bone in his body was broken. I couldn’t imagine how the Dragon must have lifted Tor up so gently, barely breaking his skin before he released him high in the sky and he fell slamming into the ground, sending him to Sovngarde. 


One body was missing entirely. 


Heric and I had walked back to the stables to fetch some buckets and water so we could dowse the hot bodies for removal.


“Luna, did you see how big that thing was?” said Heric.


“Yes.”


“They killed it.”


“Yes they did.”

“Not before it killed some of us.”


“No.”


“Not sure I want to go out hunting dragons, Luna.”


“Me neither, Heric.”


After we dowsed the bodies and waited for the steam to subside, we wrapped them in linen and put them on the cart. Heric lost it when a foot fell off one of the corpses and we had to retrieve it from the road. We’d tried not to laugh, we really did, but we couldn’t help ourselves, and at least it stopped the tears from coming.


After we left them in Anders care at the Hall of the Dead, Caius sent me to catalogue the guard’s belongings. Tor was to be interred in his uniform, the destruction of which meant the other two would be wrapped and laid out, without. Anders had said he would lay them together as they had died. Anders was sweet, and practical as each could still not be named. 


Any spare armour or weapons would be reissued. Personal belongings would be packed up and sent back to their kin. Caius wrote the letters that would inform them of the deaths.  They would go out with a courier on the morrow along with the requisite 50 gold the Jarl sent to relatives of any guard who died defending the city. I was very glad the task had not been mine.


It had been bad enough packing up their possessions. Hroki had had so little, but really seemed to like cheese – I even found 3 wheels under his bunk. I dusted them off and left them in the barracks; hopefully the others would honour him in their eating. Amongst Tor’s books and clothing, my heart near broke when I found a half-written love poem. He’d apparently abandoned it when he failed to find a word to rhyme with Carlotta. I knew not what to do with it. 


The sad knowledge of its existence weighed heavy on me, along with the more unsettling knowledge that we now had a Dragonborn in our midst. I couldn’t decide if I should be joyful or afraid. I didn’t know if it was the beginning of something, or the end.

I hide out with the doors locked for a bit, and then we hear a whoosh as a more human looking ship lands, and out pile a mess of power-armored humans, some of them even FLYING! The side of the ship says X-Com (Top Secret).

So I spring into action, now is the time to save myself and the store:

I tried running in circles!

Next I block a doorway with my body, I hope that keeps the aliens out,  an X-Com officer with a nametag that says ""Uta HighPsySharpShooter"" yells at me to move. What an odd name.

I wander a few paces away, but I'd really like these X-com folks to help me, so I wait until she lines up a shot on one of those green aliens and hop in the way so she sees me.

Then she shoots 3 shots, 1 hits me, one hits and kills the alien, and another obliterates the cash register. Who is going to pay for that? 

I'm hurt but not dying, Uta whips out what looks like a calculator and somehow patches up the gaping hole in my chest. Then she just stands there while an alien fires at her! Then she whips out some odd contraption, and makes the alien drop a grenade on itself and a nearby buddy! 

Just when I think I'm saved she stands there while another alien gets super close to us. Thankfully another of her X-Com mates kills that one. Then Uta whips out a blue rod and says ""this is for your own good"" and zaps the hell out of me. 

I wake up two days later in the hospital, my ass hurts like hell, and my assistant Kevin says the aliens probed me anally while I was out. I don't buy it for a minute, as soon as I'm out of here I'm going to fire Kevin.

**16th of Sun's Height**  

O deepest joy! O inexpressible gratitude! O bounteous and merciful gods! I have been freed, permitted once more to enjoy the fresh air and sunlight of this glorious province! But I am getting ahead of myself; let me fully expound upon the circumstances of my release.  

As you will have gathered from my last entry, my incarceration had plunged me into the depths of a deep and abiding gloom. I feared that I would never again see the light of day, or the faces of those I love most. I feared the very skin would wither from my face and turn to ashes in the darkness of that cell, my soul trapped forever beneath the streets of Riften. However, the food was very agreeable and the guards mostly kind-hearted. I don't believe I should have lasted as long as I did without Luna's special recipe for scrambled eggs (and her agreement to fetch me a non-scratchy blanket from her own belongings. Riften wool is shockingly rough against the skin).  

Two things happened in those blackest of nights that saw me through. Firstly I forged a reluctant and uneasy acquaintance with my snoring prison-mate, once he had recovered from his 'sleeping sickness' (a sickness induced, as far as I can tell, by the imbibing of large quantities of mead). A most disagreeable fellow indeed, with an astonishingly high opinion of himself, though this paled in comparison to his perception of the regard in which he is held by every single woman in Tamriel. His manners in dealing with the female guards caused me to cringe such that if the winds had changed, my face would have been stuck in a very contorted expression indeed. To their credit, the guards never once reacted to his advances or his jibes, which can be explained purely as self-preservation given the fellow's high standing in the town. Sibbi, as he introduced himself, is the grandson of Maven Black-Briar, a woman of such repute that she is oft-times referred to (behind her back of course) as 'the other Jarl'. To mistreat (or to be accused of mistreating) Sibbi would be akin to spitting at the feet of the grand matron Maven herself. It was a good thing therefore, Luna implied one afternoon as Sibbi lay in one of his stupors, that no one paid much attention to the preparation of his meals. She did not give details of course, but I took great pleasure in inferring all kinds of devious and revolting trickery involving the apple cider and porridge he demanded every morning for breakfast.  

I digress. To make a long story slightly shorter, Sibbi revealed to me one evening that his imprisonment was a punishment meted out to him by his grandmother for 'putting down' the brother of a former paramour. This lover (he opined at great length) was the cause of all his woes, and he would pay a 'great fortune' to the man who could track her down and bring her to 'justice'. At first I listened out of politeness, nodding and agreeing at the appropriate moments. But then… in his rambling and self-aggrandising tale of woe, his description of the woman - Svidi, he called her - began to seem terribly familiar. 'Paranoid doesn't begin to describe it,' he said, shaking his head. 'Every hour of the day Svidi wanted accounting for. Can you imagine! A man can only take so much. I have my *flaws*, of course. What man doesn't? And in my defence, Svana is a fine woman indeed, a woman greatly wanting of my affections. Who was I to deny her of my… talents?' On and on he went, until finally his description of this Svidi's prized and precious lute inlayed with mother-of-pearl flowers triggered my epiphany. I told him I knew *exactly* where Svidi was hiding, just as paranoid and angry as ever, and I would share this information with him on the condition that he use his family connections to secure my release. It seemed I would be revenged upon Lynly Star-Sung after all. Once I had convinced him by the relation of various personal anecdotes that I had indeed encountered his scorned fiancee it was only a matter of time before a guard appeared to unlock the cage and release me from my prison.  

Luna waited for me at the foot of the stairs, a cloaked figure by her side. 'You have a visitor,' she announced, whereupon the stranger drew back their hood and … O glorious delight! Luaffyn beamed at me, never more beautiful to my eyes than in that flickering lamplight, an amulet of Mara glittering at her throat. We ran into each other's arms and embraced, and wept… oh how I wept…  

'Very touching,' Sibbi drawled. 'Now keep your end of the bargain.' I looked into Luaffyn's beautiful dark eyes and suddenly all my fury at Lynly, all the hardships and humiliations of the past several months, faded away into nothing. I hadn't the heart to utter the poor girl's death sentence. And so I told Sibbi that Svidi had run to Solitude and was working as a servant girl in the Blue Palace. If nothing else, it will keep Sibbi's men busy for a while getting all the way across the province.  

Luaffyn and I are now sharing the finest room at the Bee and Barb. She has agreed to be my wife; we will be married in the temple on the morrow and thereafter make our way to Windhelm.

**2nd of First Seed**  
Salutations from Whiterun!  
Truly I feel I have found the heart of this fine province, for how can there be a city more beautiful than this? I have been made most welcome by the locals, and thanks to the Jarl's love of the bardic arts I have visited the cloud district many times already.  

After a particularly harrowing and unpleasant journey I have deployed some of my Windhelm spoils towards procuring the finest room at the Bannered Mare. I had not thought it possible, but Alfarinn, my carriage driver from Windhelm, proved to be twice as incompetent and 10 times more odious (though thankfully far less *odorous*) than [Solitude’s resident carriage driver] Thaer.  

I have chanced upon a fellow Redguard down on his luck, by the name of Brenuin. Having explained to him that I will *buy* him a bottle of Argonian wine (rather than steal him one as he initially suggested) in exchange for his company and the story of his ragged life, he has become very eager to meet. So eager, in fact, that I awoke this morning to find him standing over my bed, staring intently, ‘Waiting on you to wake’ as he put it. To his annoyance I was forced to put him off another day as I promised the Jarl I would instruct his son Nelkir in the basics of lute playing today. Truth be told, Nelkir is a repulsive little bastard without a good word to say to anyone and I would far rather spend the day wheedling tall tales from Brenuin, despite his malodorous air and habit of constantly scratching himself as though infested. Ah well. Such are the trials of a travelling bard’s life.  

**3rd of First Seed**  
Another glorious day in the heart of Skyrim.  

As previously noted, I spent yesterday afternoon *attempting* to teach Nelkir how to play the lute. The little brat barely knows his left hand from his right, never mind one chord from another. After he tied my bootlaces together and I plunged headfirst into the hearth, I skewered him through the chest with a poker and gave him to the cook for tenderising.  

Well, that is what I *wanted* to do. Instead the Jarl announced he was pleased with his son’s progress and he wishes me to continue my instruction on the morrow. I should very much like to make a rude gesture to the Jarl and refuse, but I cannot, especially since he has offered to provide me with residence for the remainder of my stay in exchange for my musical tuition. My Windhelm earnings will not last long if I remain at the Bannered Mare.  

To make things worse, my appointment with Brenuin yielded little more than a hearty ‘thank you’, an incoherent parable about a skeever and a mudcrab, and (if the itching on my scalp is anything to go by) a case of snowlice, before my intoxicated subject fell backwards off his bench and into a Bloodwine-coma.

*This story revolves around a decision made in the ""Street Rat"" version of the Human Story Quest.  If you haven't gotten to the second or third section of your story quest and would like it to stay a mystery, don't read this yet! (but you might like it after.)*





Today I woke up in the dark.  I was sore from head to toe, collapsed against the wall and having a hard time breathing.  I tried to move and realized I hadn't passed out drunk against the wall- I'd been put here.  Rope chafed at my wrists and ankles, and rags were wrapped around my mouth and eyes.  I took panicked breaths through my nose and tried to remember what had happened.


My head was pounding something fierce.  I wiggled a bit, trying to get a bit more comfortable- light and pain blazed through my skull.


I woke up again.  I wondered how much time had passed.  Five minutes? A day? A week?  I felt like it had been ages, but in the dark I had no way of knowing.  It was alright.  I didn't need to panic.  My best friend, the 'Hero of Shaemoore,' she'd come for me.  She always came for me.


Life on the street isn't easy, by any means, but having her made it easier.  She lived on the streets, but she wasn't just an average street rat.  She was always the smart one; the strong one; the quick one.  From the very beginning, when she'd distract a merchant while I borrowed a few apples or a loaf of bread, to just recently when she really pulled my ass out of the fire.


She always comes for me.  She left- was gone for three days and came back after having gone beyond the city walls, fought Centaur, and earned herself a title, 'Hero of Shaemoore.'  I knew she'd come back when I needed her- and she did.  I was neck deep with Two-Blade Pete over Alice's capture... of course she had to say her ""I told you so,"" but she helped me anyway.


She's my best friend.  We've been through everything together.  She's like the sister I'm pretty sure I never had.  Stolen apples taste so much sweeter when you're lounged in an alley with your best friend beside you, laughing at the slow merchant while juice drips down your fingers.


But at the moment, I didn't taste the sweet tart bite of an apple, I tasted a thick musty rag.  Every move I made caused a cascade of pain through my body, and the ropes were too tight- making it so I could barely feel my hands or feet.  Another wave of panic ran through me, but I tried to push it away.  She'd be here.  She'd come for me.


Sure, she'd been hanging around with the Seraph... What she saw in those dull-witted guards I have no idea.  Didn't she remember all the times they'd chased us, harassed us, threatened to toss us in jail for theft?  They were the enemies.


But she was still her.  She hadn't changed that much, just because they called her a hero, had she?  She'd come and helped me with Alice.  Then she'd helped me again at the apothecary.  This was just another scuffle.  She'd come and save me, and tell me how stupid I was to get captured by Pete's gang of thugs.  I'd look properly ashamed for a bit then she'd be back.  We'd steal some apples and sit in  shady alley and enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor- just like old times.


How long had it been, now?  I was so thirsty.  The rag they'd gagged me with wasn't doing me any favors.  Before I could dwell on the thought to long I heard banging.  A bit of light filtered through my blindfold.  A voice echoed through the room, ""Did you hear?!"" a man yelled, ""That bitch is at the well right now.""  Heavy footsteps came toward me, ""You hear that, Quinn?"" the voice yelled in my face, ""She's not here.  She's in the city, fighting beside her beloved Seraph.""  A kick connected with my side and I tried to curl up into a ball, whimpering into the gag.


""This is your fault, you brought her into this.  It's time for you to pay your dues.""  The voice came closer, ""Do you think she'll even mourn you?"" the voice asked, laced with venom.


Sharp pain flared through me, but it was nothing to the icy cold that washed across my soul.

Killed them all with Wolf's 10mm while he slept. I killed men who didn't deserve death. One day, wolf didn't come back from his scavenging, I was worried, but I gave him more time. Later he came back with different supplies. He had bags of food, water, ammo and guns. He handed me some leather armor and told me to put it on, Once I did he handed me a hunting rifle and told me to follow him, Once I asked where we were going all he said was ""west, far west.""


Week later, barley a dent in our supplies which is good. But then, I see him. The bastard, I line up the shot about to fire but then he gets out of sight. I begin to sprint but wolf stops me and said ""we need to keep moving, Forget our past"" I followed, but next time I see the fucker I won't give him a chance to live.


...It's been, long I've lost track. It's probably years since we left the capital waste. Wolf was getting worn out but he still kept going. Were in Chicago. Only way I know is because I saw the sign. Were then greeted by two men in power armor. Wolf tells me to keep my gun down and follow them, They forced us to stay at this base, help out with what we can, Only man that even treated us like another human being was this scientist name Whitley. Working on some kind of eyebot, Like the one I saw back at the church underneath the house near megaton they had one that blasted the radio.


Nights past, Wolf is getting angry he tells me he's going to see if he can get us out of here and he leaves, I fall asleep until he returns. I was awoken by Whitley, he was panicking. I told him to calm down and he said ""Listen I don't have much time but your friend is dead and there about to come and kill you!"" I was speechless, Wolf was the only man who I looked up to and he was dead....Whitley then says ""Here's the key to the gate, I snagged it on a sleeping solider, I'm also giving you access to one of my projects. I call him ED-E"" Then one of those eyebots come out, ""He will track your movements"" Whitley said ""He'll also get you the hell out of here! Go now!"". Saying nothing, I grab whatever I can sneak out and get our brahim and run like hell out of that place. I continue to head west...END

A fine crisp breeze was coming in from the northwest. I could see it beginning life on the icy crests of the Sea of Ghosts, travelling around the rocks of Solitude Point, through marshy Morthal, gathering speed and howling through the cavern of Cold Rock Pass, scouring the tundra, scooping up over the worn stone walls and flowing into the ‘Run’s districts.  Touching all of the places and all of the people I loved in Skyrim.


The Dragonborn had left Whiterun and rumours abounded. Some said he was setting up home with a Companion, a dog and a dozen orphans in Falkreath, others said that he’d joined the Dawnguard; one story even had him battling ash spawn in Solstheim. And then there were the darker tales, talk of the Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood and even Daedra worship.


Jordic had made a bad joke about the DB joining the DB, but even I laughed.


Loki had more than successfully regained the powers of speech and even produced a legendary prank that involved Commander Caius, that clothes iron and an archery mannequin he’d managed to dress like the Jarl. It was so funny even the Commander forgave him.


Roddy had talked me out of tracking down the dragon burial sites, or joining the Dawnguard or becoming a Skryim bounty hunter and clearing out the bandits on the plain.  He said I was a Whiterun Guard and I belonged here defending the city. Even if all it meant was keeping our sorry lot of comrades from drinking too much mead, eating too much cheese and telling too many jokes about knees and arrows.


And he was right.  I was a Whiterun Guard, and I loved my job. I loved my barrack mates and I loved my city.


I loved how the sweet smell of lavender caught the breeze on a summer night.  I loved how Heric never failed to make us laugh whilst drinking us all under the table. I loved how Jon the Red had declared his love for Carlotta who had accepted him, much to everyone’s surprise – including him.


I loved how the Skyforge glowed at night and you could see the light from every tower in the ‘Run. I loved how Arcardia diagnosed you with non-existent ailments as soon as you walked in the door. I loved how Belly had recently managed to sell Nazeem a slightly used set of enchanted Dwarven Gauntlets – Zenithar only knew where Belly had got them, or what Nazeem would do with them.


I loved how Adrienne quietly loved Ulfberth and Jon secretly loved Olfina. This was my town and my people and I would protect them all until Sovngarde called.


No-one knew what the future held, for us or for Whiterun. There were rumours of a truce and rumours of a battle.  We’d be ready and take what came. After all we’d killed a dragon once and we could do it again.


I pulled the creased parchment out of my pocket. I unfolded it and touched the words gently, it caught a little in the wind and a tiny flake of snow landed, blurring the ink.  I tore it slowly into pieces and let them go. I watched as they fluttered down and burnt up in the brazier below. Little charred embers flared and floated into the sky. Tor’s love would forever grace Aetherius.


I heard the gate open and the twins giggling.


“Luna!” It was Roddy, off duty in tunic and pants. He had great legs and I smiled at the sight. “Are you coming for a drink? Sinmir seems to have abandoned the Mare and just about the whole guard is in there celebrating, singing The Dragonborn Comes. They’ve added some questionable lyrics and Olfrid just whacked Mikael on the head with his tankard - seems to have improved his singing.  Come on, you don’t want to miss it.”


“On my way, love, on my way.” I said, turned and walked back into Whiterun, my town.

The End.

__________________________________________________________


I woke up. That was a surprise in itself, but more than that, I felt great. I sat up. Awesome. I could move again. Whatever paralyzing magic held me was gone. I got up and stretched. I felt… more. Like I was alive in ways I hadn’t been before. Stronger, somehow. Good. Time to get revenge on that Altmer bastard. I don’t know how I survived, but it sure as hell wasn’t any fault of his. 

I roamed the ice-coated walls, passing empty cell after empty cell. Well, I say cell, they were more like cages built into the ice. Creepy. Why did I let that unnatural girl lead me to such an unnatural place? Damn her. Damn the bloody elves. Who were they to treat me, Ragnar the Red, greatest sellsword from here to Cyrodiil, like a lab rat? They would feel my vengeance like the very scourge of Molag Bal himself. 

Turning from the hallway into an open closet, I spotted my axe and armor hanging. Changing into them quickly (By the Eight the metal was cold!) I then grimly marched farther down the corridor. I could hear dimly some heated discussion taking place on the other side of a (surprise) ice-coated door.

Listening for a second, I could make out Matilda’s voice.
“Please, We need Ragnar. He’s spent time in the Legion. If this plan is to work, we need a man who can relate to the people. A man who can rally the Nords.” How nice. She was volunteering me for some silly crusade. I took her for having more sense than that. The Devil-woman should have told me what I was getting into before luring me up here with promises of gold. Fury rose from deep in my chest, and I slammed open the doors, surprising a small council of mixed races. I spotted my torturer at the head of the table, looking fairly panicked. I roared
“I AM RAGNAR THE RED. SLAYER OF HUNDREDS, FEAR OF THOUSANDS (not really, but who was gonna check me on that one?) AND YOU HAVE MADE ME VERY ANGRY.”
I let loose my fury and charged at the nearest member. The shock in the room was so much that I managed to lop off his head before anyone could even get up. I was about to proceed to the next one when my torturer stood up, and said with a voice of raw power: “stop.” The weapons flew out of my hands of their own accord, and my body froze in place. 
“You have been given a gift beyond price, and were about to be accorded an honor beyond reckoning. An you repay us by murdering one of our number?”
at that moment, I regained some control of my voice, and said
“I was never given a choice! And stabbing me in the chest is a poor way to repay me for traveling up here!” My brief resistance was silenced again. 
The elf looked briefly sad, and said, almost to himself, “it is as I feared. The magic brought out the worst in him.” Looking up again, he stared straight at me, and said “On account of Matilda’s defense of your character, you have two days. You may go anywhere you think necessary, but know this – we will never stop hunting you. Only with your death shall we be satisfied.”
There was the odd, jarring screech of a plane of oblivion being opened behind me, and I was forcibly dragged In and out of it.
I had reappeared on a large tundra. I looked around frantically, and spied Dragonsreach, framed against the setting sun. 

I had turned about frantically for a while, when I realized the best thing to do would be to Rorik’s land. It was somewhere out here, as I recall. I had always been such a great friend to him, so he’d probably return the favor. 
After all, we had shared most of our adventures. I had at least as much a claim on the land as he did. Besides, you can’t say no to Ragnar the Red!

Marching confidently down the road, I soon saw the dim flickering of a hearth fire through a window. Strolling up to the door, I knocked, and yelled,
“Rorik! You miserable Legion dog, Let me in!”
I heard a booming laugh, as Rorik opened the door wide. We shook hands, and saluted each other, in the Legion way, fist over our hearts. Both of us laughed at that, and we walked inside. Once we sat down, and he drew us both up some ale, he said
“So how’d you end up here?” Laughing, I replied
“Ah, well, I was selling my blade to some nobleman in whiterun who wanted some bandits cleared out around here. Thought I’d stop by to have my friend tell me of my valor to cheer me up.”
“I would, but there’s naught to tell!” he laughed ;
“Oh, Come now, the whole reason you ended up in this cozy little place was because of me!”
“I beg your pardon! Falling into an ambush and needing rescuing hardly makes you a hero!”

The joshing went on from there, but we all know it was really thanks to me he ended up as he did. He seemed to laugh at my jokes less than he used to, but I told him he’d only have the grace of my company for that night. His wife and kids (who were asleep at the time of my arrival) weren’t prepared for the awesome sight of seeing me in combat. 

Because when they come for me, they will know the reason Ragnar the Red has so many stories to tell.

**Shining Ebony Part V** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

Three months passed since the day when the lycanthropes attacked. Siris continued to show his valor through his military skills. Most of the elven forts and encampments could not hold out against the armies, or the Thu'um that Siris wielded. 

Throughout this period, Siris hunted only one elf... Telindil. He wanted answers, but he also wanted vengeance.

One day, Siris' unit was sent to ""handle"" a small elven group of soldiers.
____

Siris, Silian, Aisha, and the rest of Siris' unit approached a small oasis. The water within it was sky-blue and looked clear and refreshing.

The unit quickly jumped towards the water and started drinking. Siris walked around. He heard a rustle coming from a bush. Was it a bird? a rabbit maybe? He walked over to the bush and looked into it. He saw a pair of yellow eyes staring towards him. An elf jumped out of the bush and attempted to stab him. Siris drew his sword, blocked the incoming attack with his shield, and thrust his blade into the heart of the elf.

""To arms!"" Siris yelled.

The rest of the soldiers quickly grabbed their swords, maces, shields, axes, and bows and grouped together as Altmer soldiers jumped from the bushes and began spewing fiery and freezing magic upon them. The Redguards quickly overpowered them.

The elves quickly gave up the fight and started running. They ran out of the oasis and Siris and his unit pursued them into the desert as night began to fall. After a few hours of chasing into the night, the Redguards and the other soldiers looked over to the distance.

A temple stood over the horizon, and the elves were running to it.

""What do you think is in there?"" one of the Redguards asked nervously.

""I'm not going into some temple,"" said another.

""Who knows what could be in there,"" said a Dunmer.

""I think we should root them out,"" said Siris, ""Let's try to capture them alive. They could have some information.""

The soldiers started moving towards the temple.

The temple had many intricate designs and many different symbols on it that nobody could read. They entered the the temple.
____

The inside was flooded with designs, patterns, and all kinds of strange symbols. The soldiers walked slowly and quietly, so as to not awaken this quiet place. There seemed to be no sign of the elves.

""What do you think this is?"" Aisha quietly asked.

""I'm not sure,"" Siris replied, ""I've never seen anything like it. What about you, Silian?""

""I've been almost everywhere in Tamriel... and yet... I have never seen anything as diverse as this.""

The group came upon a passageway that lead to two directions.

""Captain, which way?"" somebody asked.

Siris said, ""Follow me.""

Siris turned towards the left passageway and everybody else followed him. The symbols became stranger and stranger as they walked through the passageway.

The group of soldiers came upon a large, square-shaped room. Several bodies lay dead on the ground.

""Check them."" Siris said.

To their surprise, the bodies seemed to be that of Thalmor soldiers, but they were not the ones from before.

The Dunmer trembled, ""do you think this is one of those draugr crypts, like the ones they talk about in Skyrim?""

""This is no draugr crypt,"" one of the more observant Redguards said, ""look at that picture, what do you all think it is?""

Everybody looked upon the picture in question.

""It appears to be a staff."" Siris answered, ""What of it?""

""That's no ordinary staff,"" the Redguard said back, ""That's the Staff of Worms.""

At the moment he said that, a loud moaning sound was heard throughout the room. All the soldiers looked back, and to their horror,

The once dead elves began rising from the dead.

Without thinking, Siris yelled, ""Grab your weapons! Kill them!""

The soldiers grabbed their weapons and started to hack at the undead. Silian cut off one of their arms and out poured a slow stream of worms. The elf was unhindered, however, and continued attacking until he cut off its head.

Before long, the elves were brought back to the dead.

""What was that!"" Siris yelled towards the Redguard who spoke of the staff, ""What does this staff do?"" 

""I've studied this for as long as I can remember,"" the Redguard spoke back, ""It belonged to a necromancer named... Mannimarco. He was a very powerful necromancer as well. His name has come up several times in history, but I'm going to focus on the current situation. A little under two hundred years ago, during the time of the Oblivion Crisis, Mannimarco, the King of Worms appeared in Cyrodil and began attacking the Mages Guild. Hannibal Traven, the Archmage of Cyrodil's Mages guild, gave his own soul to the Hero of Kvatch, yes, the one who closed the Oblivion Gates, to defeat him. The Hero of Kvatch was able to defeat him, but he retrieved something from him. It was this staff.""

He pointed at the picture.

""The Staff of Worms.""

""What's so special about it?"" Aisha asked.

""This staff seemed to be useless to the hero, and it was quickly lost to time after the hero left the world. Nobody's quite sure where he went.

The staff was able to raise people from the dead. It doesn't seem all too powerful, especially since our magic now can do this very easily However, it was rumored that the staff may have more influence elsewhere. My guess is that the staff has more influence here, and that only means one thing...""

""The elves have the staff,"" said Siris.

""Precisely!"" said the Redguard. This almost definitely means that there are more Thalmor here and that somebody here holds the staff.

After saying that, loud cries, shrieks, shrills, and moans were heard in several directions. 

""Quickly!"" Siris shouted, ""this way!"" 

He began running through a large passageway that led out of the room and everybody followed him. 

Creatures came running towards them from both behind and in front of them. The eyes of these zombies seemed to glow bright purple. Other than that, their appearance seemed quite ghastly. There were all types of undead ranging from any of the sentient races to creatures such as trolls and wolves. There were some creatures that were completely unrecognizable.

Siris continued running towards these creatures as the soldiers prepared to drive their weapons into these beasts. When they were close enough, Siris yelled,

""FUS RO DAH!""

and the creatures that were in front of the unit were knocked down to the ground. Siris and the rest of the soldiers ran past them, destroyed the creatures that were still standing, and cut down the ones that were getting back up while the soldiers in the back defended the unit from the ones charging towards the rear.

When the zombies had been decimated, Siris looked back. There were a few casualties and several injured. 

Aisha approached Siris and said, 

""Siris, I think heading back is probably the best idea.""

""No,"" Siris said, ""We've got to keep moving through the temple.""

""As much as I hate to say this,"" Silian said, ""but I think Siris is right. If the Staff of Worms is in this very location, and it can do this, there must be a reason for them to have it.""

""Whatever the reason they have for holding it is, we need to keep moving,"" said Siris.

Siris, Aisha, Silian, and the rest of the unit continued through the many different passageways throughout the temple. A wave of the decayed and deformed zombies continued to attack in ambushes. The timing of their attacks were unpredictable. Everyone held their weapons up to prevent themselves from being taken by surprise.

At one point, Siris' group came upon groups of elves fighting off the zombies. Siris' soldiers joined in and created a three-way battle. Once both the elves and the zombies were killed, Aisha said,

""Well, at least these creatures aren't allied with the elves.""

""Then why do the elves have the staff if they can't control them?"" asked the Dunmer from before.

""Probably they aren't here to control them,"" reponded the scholastic Redguard, ""but... why else would they be here?""

""I don't know,"" Siris said back, ""but we need to keep moving. Keep your weapons up and watch your backs.""

They kept moving and fighting through the temple until they approached a large door guarded by two elves. Two arrows flew into the heads of these guards, ultimately ending their lives.

""This must be it."" Siris said.

The door was opened and the soldiers rushed in with Siris leading them. When they entered, they froze. This room was large, circular, had the most intricate symbols and designs out of all the other rooms, and it was colored red and black. The Thalmor stood all around the room. In the middle of this circular room stood a high elf with a large scar down his face. He was holding the Staff of Worms.

""Ah, it seems the pathetic Redguards have sent their own force,"" he said as he paced around the room, ""But, before I completely obliterate you all, allow me to introduce myself. I am Telindil, supreme general of the Aldmeri Dominion here in Hammerfell, and master of the arcane arts... and you are?""

""Siris,"" Siris answered angrily.

Telindil stared at him for a moment, then he continued,

""Ah yes, you're the *Ebony Warrior*. I've been waiting to meet you. Who knew that you would meet me right before you all meet your doom.""

""What are you talking about?"" Siris asked. 

""This staff is to be your undoing,"" he said in reply.

""Give it up. You can't even control the creatures.""

""The creatures? Who said anything about controlling the creatures? Of course, I will be controlling all kinds of undead once this is over, but the purpose of this staff isn't to control them.""

""Then what is it?""

""This staff will allow me to absorb the power of Mannimarco, himself. That is what he made the staff for. This is where his power currently lingers. I will absorb his power, and with it, I shall squash every Redguard and later, any empire! There is nothing you can do to stop it.""

""You're wrong. You killed my father, and you will die before you can become 'Lord of the Dead' or whatever it is you plan on calling yourself.""

""Don't even try, boy. You are hopelessly outnumbered.""

""I beg to differ,"" said Siris.

""I beg to differ as well,"" responded Telindil. As he said that, he rose the Staff of Worms into the air. Almost immediately, the wall of this circular room began cracking in multiple areas. Hordes of the undead creatures began pouring out as the wall began collapsing in the cracked areas.

The creatures began killing both the elves and Siris' unit, but they refrained from going near the Telindil and the staff.

Siris, Aisha, and Silian began slaughtering both undead and elf alike. Limbs were cut from the reanimated creatures and one by one they fell. As the numbers of undead diminished, more poured out, and all of a sudden,

An large beast crashed through the wall. This beast was no taller than a giant, but this was no giant. This creature was composed of several types of flesh from different creatures. It had strong and powerful legs and forearms, claws on one arm and a large spike on its other arm. Its head was large, and somewhat similar to that of a werewolf, however, it only had one eye.

It took a step and crushed an elf woman under its foot. It then impaled a Redguard with its arm and proceeded to eat it. Soldiers from both sides came together and tried to take it down, but were slowly killed one by one. The rest of the soldiers ran away from it while defending themselves from the other undead.

The giant creature came upon Aisha and she jumped out of the way as it attempted to grab her with its claws. She tried hitting her swords against the creature's forearms, but to no avail. The undead beast then backhanded her and she hit the wall. She turned to face the inevitable fate of a soldier...

But Siris jumped in the way of the beast, and it yelled the most painstakingly disturbing yell anyone there had ever heard. The creature then attempted to impale Siris. However, he dodged and jumped on the arm. The giant beast swung its arm, trying to throw Siris off, but he held on. He took his sword and blocked the incoming claw attack. The creature then threw him up into the air, and he came back down on its head. 

Siris quickly drew his bow, pulled an placed an arrow, aimed it at the beast's eye, but then he noticed something...

... Telindil was levitating, and strange mists were swirling around him.

Without thinking, Siris pointed the bow at Telindil, and fired it. Instead of hitting Telindil, however, the arrow hit the Staff of Worms. The force of the arrow broke the staff in two and Telindil came crashing down. The beast fell dead, for the staff was broken. All of the other undead creatures followed suit and the room was left with Siris and several of his troops with Telindil with fewer troops.

Telindil, seeing the disadvantage he was at, and realizing his plan just failed, gave a cruel and wicked smile, and said,

""It seems you've won this one, boy. I could easily kill you right here, right now, despite these circumstances, but what purpose would I have in doing so? You've already destroyed what I came here for. No, when I kill you, I want you to be crawling on your belly, demanding for mercy. Will you receive this mercy? No, you will not receive such mercy, and your father won't be able to hear you scream...""

Siris yelled and charged at Telindil, who threw an invisibility spell on himself and quickly left the room as the other elven soldiers attacked them. Once they had been taken care of, Telindil was nowhere to be found. Siris and Silian approached the staff. It disintegrated before their eyes.

""Is the staff gone?"" asked Siris.

""No,"" responded Silian, ""An artifact such as that cannot be simply destroyed. It can be, as we've just seen, but they always reappear at some point. No one will know when the artifact reappears, it could be soon or in a hundred years. Once the artifact reappears, someone will be there to claim it. For now it is gone. Let's get back.

When they exited the temple, the sun began to rise.
____

After Siris and his unit came back to the camp, Siris went back to the rock where he and Aisha had met several times before. Aisha was there as he predicted so he sat down by her and looked over the camp.

""Thanks for saving me... I guess,"" said Aisha.""

""It's fine,"" Siris said back, ""you would've done the same for me.""

Aisha looked over at the camp, without turning towards Siris and said,

""Siris, if I were to die, where do you think I would go... I mean... Where do you think think we go when we die?""

Siris looked over at the blue sky and the sands of the desert. He thought of his father, and thought of the power he had acquired from his father's note.

""Sovngarde,"" he said.

This Argonian motherfucker walks in, gives Camilla this note that is supposedly from Sven, the Nord trying to date her, when clearly its not even remotely close to his handwriting. She believes this dude and now she never wants to see Sven ever again. Great, shes probably going to end up marrying that stupid Elven Bard.
Now this slimy Argonian dude comes up to me and starts selling me shit I don't need/want. Apparently he had overheard my conversation with Camilla so he asks whats up, me being a little tipsy tell him that our family heirloom has been stolen and the thieves left for Bleak Falls Barrow. Thinking I'll finally get rid of this jackass I tell him I will pay him if he can return it. He finally leaves and luckily enough he takes the elven dude, whatever his name is, with him, kill two birds with one stone amirite?

So fast forward like a day, max, that same Argonian dude waltzes back into my shop carrying the Dragonclaw. Motherfucker, he actually got it back. Great now I have to pay this asshole. So he tells me that my recently sold shipments would suffice, so I have to give this dude 500 gold. Dude then says, wait there's more and sells me even more useless junk that I don't need and now I'm left with like 13 gold coins. Motherfucker. At least he leaves right after that, but right after he leaves I look down and the fucking Dragonclaw I put on the counter right in front of me is gone, as wells as half my inventory. That slimy asshole stole that shit right in front of me, I mean no one else has been in the shop all day.

So I'm struggling now to keep my business afloat, I can't purchase goods to sell because I have no gold to buy them, I have a bunch of useless shit that nobody wants to buy taking up my floor space and my dragonclaw is missing again. Camilla is also fretting because that elven dude, Fendale or something, hasn't returned any of her letters. But hey, at least she won't be marrying an elf. I'm sitting at the counter, ready to fall asleep its been so dead, and that son of a bitch Argonian walks in. He ignores me completely and instead walks over to Camilla and gives her an Amulet of Mara. THIS ASSHOLE WANTS TO MARRY CAMILLA? He probably said something like Fandell wanted her to be with him or some other bullshit. Oh great, she accepted. I'm going to be related to this asshole. Uh Oh, he's walking over here uhhhh quickly thank him again for retrieving the CLAW THAT YOU STOLE!!!! He sells me more useless shit. What a complete douchebag.
He's taken my claw, stolen half my inventory, sold me useless shit I can't get rid of. Taken my sister and only other co-worker away and, to top it all off, I'm now his brother in law. I'm going to have half Imperial, half Argonian nieces and nephews.

**10th of Sun's Height**  

How to begin this entry. I feel as though my life has taken a severe wrong turn at some juncture and I shall be forever paying the price. I never should have come here.  

I write this from - of all places - a cramped prison cell beneath the streets of Riften. I am only glad that my dear mother is not alive to learn of my fate, for I fear she would die all over again.  

How did I come to be here? I must write quickly as the hour grows late, and the guard will be along shortly to snuff out the lights.  

I found Brynjolf the very next morning after my last entry, and together we took a walk around the town, with Bryn stopping by the main gate to trade what appeared to be candlesticks he had secreted inside his cloak for several jars containing some sort of small crystallised granules. This ought to have raised my suspicions, in retrospect; however, Brynjolf is a charming and very persuasive companion and soon we were laughing together over a flagon or four of Black-Briar mead and planning our 'charity' event. Little did I know, the only charity Brynjolf and his companions were planning would be for the benefit of the Thieves Guild. I am such a fool.  

Here comes the guard now. I shall write more tomorrow if my materials are not confiscated.  

**11th of Sun's Height**  

I must say, the food here in prison is surprisingly good. Although I miss my hosts at the Bee and Barb, their breakfast choices are… *unusual*, and not always immediately identifiable either by sight nor by taste. Here in prison I have been served scrambled eggs and spicy sausage this morning, with a large jug of warm apple cider. I have had far worse meals in much more salubrious surroundings. The other cells are empty save for the one furthest from me, the occupant of which has been snoring lightly since my arrival. The guards check in every hour or so, and one of them - a warm-voiced Nord woman by the name of Luna - hails from Whiterun and has prevailed upon me for updates on the town and its citizens. In exchange I have been allowed to practice my lute for two hours each evening as long as I 'behave'. How one could be expected to misbehave in a stone cell featuring nothing more than a bed roll and a waste bucket I do not know.  

**12th of Sun's Height**  

Word of my evening practice sessions seems to have spread amongst the guards. Luna tells me they drew straws to see which four unlucky souls would take gatehouse shifts in the rain whilst the others brought stools and cushions and called out requests in between gossipy conversations about citizens and noblemen.  

This is all very grand, yet I cannot escape the image of myself as some kind of overgrown and featherless canary, caged and singing for the amusement of my captors. I ask every guard I see for updates on my trial (if there is to be a trial; I am not convinced that the Rift has a justice system at all!) and I am simply told I must be patient.  

I would very much like to go home. I am no fearless adventurer. I am but a simple bard blessed with a gods-given talent for melody and rhyme. I don't belong in prison. I am consumed with hopelessness and fear. Fear that I will waste away in this cell, alone and unmourned. Woe is me.

The smell of blood, plasma and burnt bodies still hung heavily in the air. It had been nearly a month since the heretics appeared out of no where and assaulted the city of Harstad Primaris and a week since Ryan and Nigel's regiment had been station in the church to hold it against intruders. In that short time all of the regiment had been wiped out save for the two of them. Ryan watched Nigel as he crouched against the far wall. ""How silly"" he thought, ""here we sit cowering behind some sandbags in the corner of a cathedral while the Astartes mop up our mess.""

Nigel crouched looking through the windows at the street outside; a broad smile crossed his face when he spotted Astartes scouts in the streets. ""They've broken the line."" Nigel whispered ""You'll see Ry'. The Astartes will beat back the traitors and liberate the city."" Ryan had no doubt about the Astartes inevitable victory but as far as battles went in the 41st millennium they could last for years before ending. For him it wasn't a matter of 'if' it was 'when'. Ryan and Nigel had been through several campaigns together, including some in the Kronus expanse but this war was different. They'd been able to tell as soon as they'd landed the planet was trouble, Nigel had gotten that same uneasy, twitchy, feeling he always did when trouble was brewing.

After a moment of resting Ryan crawled over to the broken turret gun that had carried them through so many fights. For what seemed like the millionth time Ryan peeked up over its rim before beginning his attempted repairs. The carnage was unimaginable. Traitors, guardsmen, even a Tau scouting party all lay dead amongst the rubble. As he began to work on the gun he thanked the emperor the heretics hadn't discovered the relic within the church. It was a piece of ancient Archeotech blessed by the God Emperor himself when the planet was first settled during the Drussus Crusades. It supposedly gave the protector great resistances to the powers of the warp. ""'Supposedly' my foot."" He mumbled, that relic had surely saved them from the taint that had befallen a large number of the guardsmen outside the church.

With a sudden whirr and clank the gun powered back on but Ryan was quick to silence it. He didn't want any unnecessary attention. When he got up to say something to Nigel a loud explosion caused him to shut his mouth and drop to the ground. He could hear the shouts and ranting of heretics from beyond their flimsy barrier ""Hold them back!"" they shouted over and over again, truly these were madmen. Above the shouts he heard one pure voice ring out screaming ""For the glory of the Emperor, you shall not falter!"" Ryan peeked out over his barricade and say a giant clawed machine lying destroyed amongst the rubble that was the far wall of the chapel and beyond it the red and golden armor of the Astartes. ""We're saved"" he muttered until he saw a form emerge from the back of the chaos ranks firing a pistol and running full speed to the alter…and the relic. All thoughts of survival left him at that point; he powered on the gun and began tearing into the heretics ranks hoping to clear a path for the valiant marines. Nigel, ever quick on the uptake, began feeding shells into the gun. It didn't take long for the chaos marines to find them and soon they were just as pinned under heavy fire. ""The Astartes aren't going to make it!"" Nigel cried looking at Ryan in desperation. Wondering what his partner meant Ryan looked to the alter and saw the sorcerer, for there was no doubt that what the person was, performing some kind of right. Gritting his teeth in frustration Ryan turned to Nigel and saw him stand up and spring himself over the barricade. Either Nigel was ten times the soldier he gave himself credit to be or he was the luckiest bastard Ryan had ever seen. Only a few bullets grazed him and he sprinted his entire way to the sorcerer, all the while drawing his bayonet knife. Nigel screamed praise to the Emperor as he drove the six inch knife into a seam on the sorcerer's armor. Blood spurted out and covered Nigel's forearms as a bullet ripped through his collar bone. Within moment he was swimming down into blackness, he never even felt the floor hit him.

Moments later Ryan stood at attention before an Astartes Librarian as his mind was probed for traces of chaos. All around him marines were securing the church and extracting the relic also cleansing it of any lingering taint. Nigel had been severely wounded but could recover if taken to the proper facilities. ""Your mind and soul are clear guardsmen."" The librarian said calmly ""I must say I'm impressed, though I am sure the relic played no small part in this. You are relieved of duty for the time being; the heretics have lost much ground in the city and on this planet. It won't be long until they are pushed from this world entirely. Now go and may the Emperor be with you."" Ryan saluted and took his leave. He hadn't noticed but he'd taken several small hits during the last exchange and was worse off than he had thought. He piled himself into a rhino transport beside Nigel's makeshift gurney. Ryan sat wondering why the traitors had come here, ""For just one artifact?"" he wondered. No, Ryan was sure it was something else; it would be a long road ahead to take this planet back. Even a Librarian couldn't predict everything.

- Writer's Block - I actually deleted about a quarter of this chapter and completely rewrote it. I am glad I put it the way I did, though.

- Morrowind - I read about tons of people on /r/skyrim talking about how good it is, so I tried it out for myself. I just played it a little bit at a time for the last few weeks to slowly get into it, but I really got into it at when I got to level 3 about a week ago and I'm playing it all the time now. It's so different from Skyrim/Oblivion and it's so awesome to go find new places and do new things. My character's a Wood Elf Night Blade affiliated with Morag Tong, Thieve's Guild, and House Telvanni.  Right now, I'm thinking of how big Vivec is compared to Whiterun and Vivec definitely tops it.

Well, enough of my excuses, here's the story.

**Shining Ebony Part VI** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

The next day, a council was called at the pavilion...

""Siris, tell us what you found in this temple,"" asked one of the generals.

""The supreme general of the Aldmeri Dominion in Hammerfell, Telindil,"" Siris responded.

""And why was he there? What was he looking for?

""He had a staff, a magical staff that once belonged to the ancient necromancer, Mannimarco, the Staff of Worms.""

""And what was he doing with this staff?""

""The staff was able to reanimate hordes of undead, but this wasn't the true reason for him being there. His intentions were to use the power of the staff to take the role of Mannimarco, himself, and absorb his power.""

The generals, commanders, and captains started arguing amongst themselves. One of the other generals yelled,

""Quiet! Let the Ebony Warrior continue. Did Telindil succeed in his intentions?""

""No, I was able to stop him before he accomplished his task.""

""And where is this staff? Do you have it with you?""

""No, I destroyed it and it disintegrated.""

""Well, it is better for it to be destroyed than in the hands of our enemies. I would take it that Telindil escaped?""

""Yes, his soldiers gave their lives to ensure Telindil escaped with ease. I would have destroyed him if he wasn't such a coward.""

""A coward?!"" a commander yelled, ""It was pity that Telindil escaped without doing anything else! If Telindil had turned to fight, you would have all been destroyed, even you, Siris. Not one of us who have ever crossed blades with that elf have ever returned to this council. The only reason you are here is because you were lucky that he didn't decide to face you!""

The council erupted into chaos once again.

""Order!"" The other general yelled again, ""If Telindil found an artifact like the Staff of Worms, and was able to gather an army of lycanthropes, who knows what else he can do. If he knows of the location of any other powerful artifacts, or can amass forces of tremendously powerful beasts, who knows what he will pull out of his sleeve next. I am calling for the dismissal of this council. Make sure the spies are out searching for any encampments that hold beasts or locations of other artifacts.""
______

Siris entered his tent once again. Neither Silian nor Aisha were waiting for him. Siris walked towards his giant map of Hammerfell and looked at it. He took his helmet off and placed it on the map. It was quiet... a little too quiet.

He turned his head. Something seemed amiss. He walked toward the entrance to the tent and looked outside to his right and his left. He kept his hand on the hilt of his sword.    After pacing back and forth, looking in all the strangest places.

*""Must be nothing,""* Siris thought to himself, *""I guess I must be getting a bit jumpy after the whole lycanthrope attack. I think I was supposed to meet Silian...""

He lowered his guard and started walking out of the tent...

When all of a sudden, someone wearing a strange armor-set crashed through the top of the tent, grabbed his sword and charged toward Siris' back. 

Siris quickly turned, grabbed his sword, and clashed blades with the unknown person. The sword the assassin wielded was elven, but the armor the assassin wore was definitely not. It looked exotic, outlandish even. The assassin wasn't tall like the Altmer, and had no tail, so there was no way the swordsman could be a Khajiit assassin hired by the Thalmor.

The unknown swordsman fought like no other Redguard or High Elf he had seen. The assassin jumped back and formed a small firebolt in hand and fired it at Siris, who blocked it with his sword. Three more firebolts were fired in succession and Siris blocked each of them. The assassin rushed back to Siris and swung a sword as Siris ducked. The assassin swung vertically as Siris sidestepped. The assassin stabbed as Siris moved stepped forward, grabbed the assassin's sword-wielding arm, and bashed the head of the assassin with his forearm. The assassin fell to the ground, dropping the sword. The assassin reached toward the sword, but Sirs kicked it far out of reach.

""Who are you?"" Siris questioned the assassin as he pointed his ebony sword towards the assassin's chest.

""If you want to know, you should probably put away your sword. I'm a dead man whether you kill me or not.""

Sirs did not know who this man was, but he did recognize the accent. The accent as that of a Dark Elf native to Morrowind.

Siris lowered his sword as Silian, Aisha, and five other soldiers rushed into the tent.

""Who are you?"" Siris asked.

""My name,"" the Dunmer continued, ""is Teldryn Sero.""

He pulled his helmet off.

""Why is a Dark Elf working with the Thalmor?""

""I don't work with the Thalmor, I'm a prisoner to them. My wife, child, and I were all abducted from Blacklight several years ago. They force me to obey their whim and threaten to kill my family if I do not comply. Now that I've failed, my family is forfeit. They told me they would give me a week to kill you or they will kill my family.""

""Should we listen to this elf?"" one of the Redguard soldiers whispered, ""For all we know, he could be lying to us."" 

""Quiet,"" Silian said, ""he speaks the truth.""

""How are you so sure of this?"" Siris asked.

""He's planning another assault,"" Teldryn continued, ""I'm a dead man already so it matters little about what I say. He's got another creature under his command. I do not know what horrid, wretched, evil abomination this creature is, but they are holding it in the same camp they are holding my family in. Maybe, if you were to save them, I'll forever be in your debt.""

Siris paced around for a few minutes. Nobody else moved. Siris stopped, turned toward Teldryn, and said,

""Where is this camp located?""

Teldryn immediately jumped up, put his helmet on, and walked over to the map on the table.
______

After telling the Dunmer's story to the other generals, they hesitated for a moment, but they agreed with Siris. If Telindil was to release another creature, then it would be wiser to dispatch it before it was released. Siris, after being given a small army under his command, was sent to where Teldryn previously described under the cover of night.
______

""That's it!"" Teldryn quietly said as he gazed over a cliff. ""If I can free my family, I will be forever in your debt, as I said before.""

""No, I'll have an escort take you back to Morrowind, said Siris, ""This isn't your war, you've already been through enough. We need to kill this, wait... what why is the camp empty?

The army walked through the deserted camp.

""They must've known that we were coming."" Aisha said, ""See, they left their torches lit, so they couldn't have been gone for long. Let's look through the tents."" 

Every soldier looked through the tents. About half of them were filled with large cages. Teldryn, however, didn't seem concerned about the cages, but he was looking frantically through the tents. Siris followed him into one of the tents. Teldryn was kneeling. 

In front if him lay a Dark Elf woman and a small Dark Elf girl, both lay dead.

Teldryn took his helmet off and started crying. 

""Why would they do this?"" he asked, ""Why would they do this to me?""

""You can't trust the Aldmeri Dominion to keep their word,"" Siris said, ""They killed my father as well.""

Teldryn stopped.

""Wait, did you hear that?""

""Hear what?""

Teldryn drew his sword, put his helmet on and ran out of the tent.

""I've heard that before."" 

Siris followed Teldryn and yelled to Silian,

""Silian! Gather the troops and follow me!""

He then heard a screech. It wasn't very loud, but he heard it again, louder this time. Siris followed Teldryn. Teldryn looked yonder at a rock far in the distance. A small speck flew above it.

""A bird?"" Siris asked.

""No,"" Teldryn responded.

A few more specks followed the first one, and then a stream of specks flew out from both sides of the rock and into the night sky. The stream grew bigger as more specks flew out. Everybody readied their weapons.

""Cliff Racers!"" Teldryn yelled.

The stream of specks flew straight towards them. The specks grew larger and they flew closer and closer to the small army. Siris grabbed his bow and quickly shot three down. 

""Ready your bows and fire at will!"" Siris yelled.

Arrows quickly went straight towards the quickly approaching stream of Cliff Racers and many of them fell to the ground. However, not many of them fell and they kept coming. These bird-like creatures flew over the army. Several of them dropped down and speared several of the soldiers with their sharp tails. Aisha chopped one of their tails off with one scimitar before it could impale her and she quickly cut its head off with the other one.

Teldryn shot firebolts into the sky as they soared above him and encircled him. He grabbed one of them by their tail, flew slightly into the air, but since the Racer couldn't carry him far, he cut the tail off and dropped onto another one and stabbed its neck as he came down. 

Siris brought one down with his bow. It landed in front of him, but he kicked it out of the way and shot another one. 

Despite their efforts, soldiers continued to be carried away by the spear-like tails of the Cliff Racers. They encircled the army like a whirlwind and continued to pick them off. 

Silian cut them down with his katana one by one as they descended upon him.

Four Redguards tried to run out of the whirlwind of Cliff Racers. Not long after, however, about twenty of them screeched and descended upon the escapees and impaled them with ease.

Siris fired a few paralysis spells and the Racers affected crashed down to the ground, dead. Teldryn continued to burn them with firebolt spells and swung his sword at them. Multiple Cliff Racers crashed down to the ground, burning.

""There's too many of them!"" a Redguard yelled.

""There's got to be something we can do!"" yelled a Breton.

Siris shouted

""Fus Ro Dah!"" 
and opened a large pathway as Cliff Racers fell, crashed, and struggled to regain their flight.

""I don't know what that was,"" Teldryn yelled, ""but do it again!""

Siris took a few minutes to calm his mind, and shouted again,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

and many more plummeted to their deaths before they regained their flight. Arrows continued to be fired into the Cliff Racers, and their numbers quickly diminished. The whirlwind of Cliff Racers broke apart and their remnants were dispatched. With the vast majority of the Cliff Racers destroyed, they were unable to kill anyone else without being destroyed themselves. 

The soldiers started cheering.

Teldryn took his helmet off and walked away from the small army. He walked over to a small tree, withered from lack of water, and looked toward the camp. Siris and Aisha followed him. 

""Thank you Teldryn,"" Siris said in gratitude.

Teldryn said nothing.

""Teldryn,"" Aisha said, ""Do you have anyone left? A friend? A distant cousin?""

Teldryn slowly nodded, without turning, to say no.

""I'll have an escort ready to take you back to Morrowind,"" Siris said.

""No,"" Teldryn said in reply as he turned towards them, ""I can't allow the Thalmor to take the lives of other innocents. Your father was killed by the Thalmor, correct? If I were to just take my leave, I would not be doing what's right. I think that my wife and child would want me to fight them.""

The sun began to rise.

""Well, it's always good to have anybody on our side. You're one of us now,"" said Siris.

""In Azura's name, I shall fight by the side of the Ebony Warrior.""

He took his helmet, and fastened it on his head.

Thanks for reading! Yes, this battle in the story was mostly inspired by Morrowind. Those Cliff Racers were probably the most annoying things. Luckily, since I'm at lvl 10 now, I can just smash them out of the sky now and just keep moving, but there's so many of them! Well, remember to give your feedback and ideas for future stories and I'll probably be writing (or playing Morrowind... one or the other).

Part I",MrIrrationalSpock,16,5,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1a7541/skyrim_the_real_story_of_ragnar_the_red_part_i/,"Life used to be simple. In the legion, you never had to parcel out the complex motives of the factions around you. You were a weapon of the empire, what they pointed you toward, you killed. You had your buddies, and you had your orders. That was it. Occasionally you got food. Occasionally you got paid. It was the best of times, and the worst of times. Sometimes I miss it, that utter, bloody simplicity. Thing was, my friend Rorik and I got discharged from the legion. Honorably, of course. With distinction too, poor Rorik would have a limp for the rest of his life, but we made it through some of the hairiest battles in the great war. Quite the stories they were too. 
Rorik decided to settle down, use the land that the legion had given him in Skyrim to make a name for himself, be a minor lord and get the command position he always coveted. Me? I wasn’t done fighting yet. Skyrim was a huge place, surely there was something worth doing. So, I sold my sword for awhile. I used the nickname I’d gotten in the legion to get some attention: Ragnar the Red. Apparently it was some sort of crazy seeing my flaming red hair match the blood on my axe. Got on good for awhile too, I was living the simple life again. 

Then I met Her. 

I was clearing out the lowlifes from what looked like yet another hole in the ground. I was just about to head out, when I saw a fairly sizable stream running out another exit. Curious, I followed it back, into a massive cavern with a single, solitary pillar in the middle of a shallow lake. Built up around the base of this monolith was some scaffolding, and bridges to adjoining caves.  While I was admiring the view, some form of scum started taking potshots at me, running about on the scaffolding like he guarding something other than two weeks supply of firebrand wine. I charged the bastard, but he hopped off and ran like a rabbit into one of the adjoining caves. Presumably to get his buddies. Bloody cowards, the lot of them. Sighing, I took off after him. After taking down a few of the braver men posting guard, I came to an opening. They had built a godsforsaken tavern in the cave! A bloody tavern! I didn’t have too much time to admire the nerve of it, because they swarmed me then. Pah. Human skeevers, all of them – filthy, backstabbing curs. They died as such too. On a whim, and the noises drifting from farther back, I followed the cave. 

They had an entire fighting arena set up! Bloody hell, whoever led them was smarter than the average troll! They even managed to capture some sabre cats! 
What was the oddest part of the scene was the grim silence. They were all gathered around the arena, watching as a burly man in plate armor circled a thin slip of a girl in leathers. The plated giant swung his equally massive hammer in a sideways stroke. The girl ducked. Good for her, she might even last a whole minute. 
Speaking of which, I probably better give her a distraction to get away. Whether she had slept with the wrong bandit or not, that was a hell of a way to go. 
The bandits turned as a group, as I shouted
“Meet Ragnar the Red, craven thieves!”
The element of surprise was on my side, and they were fairly easily dealt with. Boy did they have a lot of gold too. My employer didn’t necessarily need to know that. 
It was with some surprise I looked over the arena walls to see the girl and the plated man still circling. The man swung again, this time vertically. Faster than I’d think possible, the lass parried the blow, spun around, and decapitated the man. Woah. 
I opened the gate and walked down slowly. 

“How’d a girl like you end up in a place like this?”
She looked at me in contempt, and said distractedly
“I lost my knife.” 
So saying, she started searching the chests around, and pulled out the most beautiful dagger I’d every seen. I whistled.
“Who’d you kill to get that blade?”
“Jorund here was the 5th in this arena” she said, as she inspected it to make sure it was undamaged. Bloody hell. I had underestimated her. Thinking she might be some sort of apparition or daedric being, I nervously asked her,
“I didn’t hear a name? and where are you from?” She looked at me with a calculating stare
“you talk a lot don’t you?”
I laughed nervously, and joked,
“who else is going to sing my praises?” There was that calculating stare again.
“I’m Matilda, I’m from Rorik’s new steading, and I may have use of you""

Trapped in the darkness under a mountain, and I'm quite certain that my leg is broken. Thankfully I did locate water quickly enough.

Not a day goes by that I don't replay that scene in my head. The child walks in, steals my greatest tools from me AS I LOOKED ON, and throws my supporters and myself aside. Because he thought it was the right thing to do. Infuriating. Impossible! No matter how I look at it shouldn't have been possible. At least I escaped. At least I know that my supporters are still out there- I've done too much for them, they wouldn't defect. They can't.

~~~

My leg doesn't hurt as much today. I should be able to explore this blasted cavern soon enough. Then maybe I'll be able to find something. Something to eat, somebody who needs me. Some kind of starting point. The water is limited, but it's enough for now. My Pokemon are beginning to starve. Let them. I am too. Hmm, actually...

~~~

Hobbling around this cave is terrible. An insult for a man like me. At the least Hydreigon has found prey in here, and it brings me some of it's kills. It can't bring itself to leave me. That gives me hope that someone will still come find me. Later. If... no, *when* I find the surface.

I wonder what the child is doing. Consorting with my traitor, in all likelihood. Still unprecedented that he would turn. And disgusting. If... when. WHEN.  When I get out, things will have to become very difficult for him.

~~~

I found sunlight today. Finally got a look at what the cave did to me, and to my last Pokemon. It's wings have atrophied rather badly, and it couldn't ,stand the sunlight. I had to recall it to the Pokeball. Can't return to civilization, somebody would recognize me. Hydreigon will have to continue hunting.

~~~

Last week the triplets found me, just as I knew they would. I still have a collection of supporters, including Zinzolin who was apprehended soon after the castle fell.

I will have control of Unova yet, and peaceful revolution is no longer a possibility. This time I'll have to be a little more vicious. The Shadow Triad, excellent servants as they are, have come across a more potent beast than what I had to work with last time. It just needs a little encouragement. N and that destructive child left Unova and haven't been heard from since, which is well enough. There's nobody left to get in my way, and this country will belong to me.

If they would not have a gentle king, they will have a dictator.

I had read something about it before, but I was now halfway through *the oblivion crisis*. I found it fascinating. What adventures that ""champion of Cyrodiil"" must have gone through... If only I could have gone on such adventures... But that was not the life for me.

My husband called from the other room: ""Hadra! Could you come help me for a minute?"" I walked over. He was hauling a few planks and a bucket of nails. He handed me the bucket. ""Here, carry these to the front door. The city is under attack."" At that moment the first rock from the catapults hit the wall. The entire city shook, and a few books fell over on their shelves.

I quickly carried the nails to the door and went to grab a hammer. I could hear the sounds of battle from outside. Our house was close to the city gate. It was the second one on the left. My husband and I bought it a little over 6 months ago. We named it Breezehome, because you could hear the breeze rustle through the straw roof when it was windy enough.

Horgnar was quite rich. He was a member of the companions, and had made more than enough coin to live comfortably for the rest of our lives. We had decided not to have any children. If he died during his job, I would have to make the money to raise the children myself, and we both agreed that that would be too hard.

Horgnar had put the first plank in front of the door, when a loud roar came from outside. The stormcloaks stormed through the now broken gate. My husband looked at me. I looked back frightened.

A loud cracking sound came from outside. Horgnar grabbed our wood-chopping axe from besides the door. Then the soldiers kicked down the door. Splinters came flying everywhere. The soldiers came through the door, searching for gold, valuables and beautiful women.

Horgnar charged at them with the axe. He hit the first one in the neck, but as he tried to pull the axe out of the soldiers neck, the second one pushed him over. I screamed loudly when the man slowly shoved his sword into Horgnars chest. The soldier looked at me now. All I could do was stare back and whisper ""*No... Please...* Please...""

He walked over to me and grabbed my wrists. I tried to kick him, but only hurt myself. I was able to squirm one hand free and grabbed a knife from the table that I had already covered for dinner. I stabbed him in the chest as hard as I could, but my knife didn't pierce his armor at all. He let out a loud laugh, which quickly faded as I stabbed the knife into his neck. He fell to his knees, still holding me by my hand. Tears were streaming down my face at this moment. I looked at my husband. He was laying on the ground and was looking in my general directon, eyes wide open, and clenching the sword that was still sticking from his chest.

I don't remember much from what happened after that, but they told me they dragged me out of the house which was now burning. It had been hit by a rock, fired at the city by the stormcloaks. They said I was hysterically crying and begging them to get Horgnar from the burning house, and when they didn't, I scratched them, bit them, and told them they were everything that was bad and ugly.

My life was destroyed. But I didn't give up. I trained and trained in the companion's courtyard, and to train my muscles I rebuilt the entire house, just the way it was. Soon I was able to fight even the strongest men, and that's when I decided that it was time.

He was wearing a black outfit and hood so I couldn't see much of him but I knew he was there for the contest because I had seen him pick ribbons off of others.

The wind howled around me, clouds of snow flying by like ghosts in the night. Instinctively I shivered, and took a long, slow drag of my cigarette. Of course smoking was technically forbidden within the defensive perimeter, but on a night such as this, a soldier should be allowed a few basic human comforts. Ivan, assigned to this shift with me, approached out of the gloom, leading Sasha, our ""attack"" dog. I say attack sarcastically, because, in all the time I've spent guarding the German frontier, I've never seen her attack anything other than her food dish. 
""Can you spare one for me, Dimitri?"" he asked. I fished around in the pockets of my greatcoat, eventually finding my prized packet of cigarettes. Pulling one out, I handed it over to Ivan. 
""Thank you, my friend."" he said as I lit it, pausing to take a long, meditative puff before asking ""Seen anything tonight?"" 
I laughed sarcastically. ""Ivan, I've been guarding these silos for a year now, and the closest thing we've had to enemy contact was the time Lt. Fyodor dressed up as the American President for the Colonel's birthday party. I've been walking this same line in the snow for the past six hours. I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I need to sleep. What do you think?"" 
Ivan, fresh out of the training facilities, stared furtively off into the darkness. ""I just don't know, comrade. I've heard rumors... rumors of the allies pushing back our forces. I thought I heard a helicopter tonight, and I almost thought I saw lights in the woods. I... I..."" 
""...have been letting the cold and stress get to my brain"" I finished for him. ""Ivan, look at me."" He turned to face me. Behind the intimidating looking battle mask, I saw the eyes of a scared boy, barely big enough to fire the Kalashnikov strapped across his back. ""Once we get back to the barracks, when Gregori and Pyotr come to relieve us, we're going to get two nice big bowls of borsht, have a good game of cards, and forget about all of this, da? You are new here. When I first arrived, I may have been a little nervous as well. But trust me, nothing is going to happen to us. The war is far away, and it's almost over. You have nothing to worry about.""
He seemed to relax a bit, and when he spoke next, he seemed a little more sure of himself. ""Well... if you say so, Dmitri."" For a few minutes, neither of us spoke. 
I thought back to when I was conscripted to fight for the Red Army. Back to the day when a huge sergeant showed up at my mother's apartment door with my paperwork, and after a hurried hug and a quick ""good-bye"", off I went. Certainly it had been hard. When I started out, maybe I was much like Ivan as well. I was nervous, jumpy, anxious. But the Red Army had been good to me. At least I had a job, three meals a day, clothes to wear, and money to spend when I finally got back to Tobolsk. Ivan's sudden exclamation shook me back into consciousness.
""Sasha! What's wrong, girl?"" Sasha stared out into the darkness, and emitted a long, low, guttural growl. I had never seen her act this way before. Suddenly, with a tremendous snarl, she broke free of Ivan's grasp and ran into the woods. We both chased after her, struggling under our heavy armor to keep up. 
Suddenly, Ivan let out a stifled sob. There, in a puddle of rapidly congealing blood, lay Sasha, her white fur cruelly marred by multiple bullet wounds. ""Who... who would do this?"" Ivan moaned. I bent down and looked at the wounds more closely. They were not the tremendous gashes and tears left by the machine guns the Allied GIs used, but rather smaller, rounder wounds. Wounds consistent with a handgun. The thought had hardly formed within my head when I heard three sudden pops. With a cry, Ivan fell to the ground beside Sasha, his helmet pierced and bleeding. A fear such as I had never known gripped me. I ran for my life, tree branches snagging on my greatcoat. As I ran, moments from the hours of lectures I been forced to sit in on ran through my head. 
""Two .45 caliber pistols."" I ran faster. ""Operating in all environments, she is the greatest soldier in the Allied Army."" A sob escaped my lips in between ragged breaths.. Through the fogging eyepieces of my helmet, I saw the perimeter's lights. If I could only make it back to the wall, I'd be safe. Safety. I had to make it. A sudden, jarring, crashing pain ran up my left leg. I fell headlong into the snow. Pain, searing pain coursed through my leg. I reached down to my leg, and to my horror I felt my knee, or rather what was left of it. I heard footsteps, soft and catlike, approaching. With one burst of effort, I rolled onto my back and looked up to see... her. Impossibly beautiful, yet with an insane light in her eyes. Her two pistols were holstered. I reached for my Kalashnikov. If I had to die, I would die like a man. I grasped my rifle and, with a sudden movement, I swung it toward her, firing as I went. 
BAM. BAM. My world exploded. Unbelievable pain burst in my chest. She stared at me a second, still pointing the two smoking pistols at my chest. With one fluid movement, she reholstered them, and with a maniacal laugh, she walked away. I tried to shout for help, but no sound came. I tried to move, but I couldn't. I thought of Ivan, of Sasha. Poor, cold, dead Ivan. It was getting cold. So cold. As I watched, she walked into the darkness.

She accused me of lying in front of our children about our money problems. I was really angry at one point and needed to go outside to cool my head down. Little did she know that I was saving up money to pay the college bills for the kids, and whenever she thought I left to drink some beers with my buddies I actually worked part time as a bartender in a strip club.

I decided to drive around a few blocks in my car, when this guy pulled me out. It happened so fast, that I didn't call the police right away. I saw him running a red light, hitting another car and when I thought he would be out of sight any second he turned left and drove over the sidewalk right in the middle of a crowd. There was blood everywhere! One could hear the people scream in agony, until he drove over the bodies on the ground a second time just to hit a man at the wall, crushing all of his bones.
And me, what was I doing? I couldn't stop watching. It didn't look real to me, more like in the movies. When I approached the scene I hid in the bushes. Then the crazy guy went out of the car. He wasn't shaking. I was. A lot.
Like in a state of trance he walked slowly towards some sort of fuse panel and meddled with it. It took him about five seconds. ""When will the cops show up?"" I was thinking to myself as I noticed he was ready to leave the place. The guy, his body all covered with tattoos, went straightly to a parked car, stole it in heart beat and drove off.

Since I couldn't hear any sirens I went into the open. The surrounding was quite enough for me to hear a whispering noise, so I snuk up to the driver's door of my car. Turns out it wasn't a cry for help but a rat. I scared it off and it fled under a dumpster, with an ear still in its mouth. That's when hell broke loose.

At least three cruisers with sirens approached my position real fast. I panicked. My boots were soaked in blood, I was standing next to my car, which - probably nobody seemed to had noticed - was robbed from me just a minute ago and I had no alibi. I did what I thought would be the smartest thing to do: I started the engine, drove through the adjoining, unlighted park (I hit a bus station on the way) and dumped my car in the sea. 

I knew it was a risky move, but on my way back on foot I had took take another look at the crime scene. But there was none. No police car, no bodies, no press, not even a single bloodstain on the floor. That was the moment I realized I might be crazy.

Of course I didn't tell my wife. Couldn't have. ""I drove my car into to the ocean because I was angry at you!""? Don't be ridiculous! Not to mention all the hallucinations I had along the way. I bought her a new car today, a better car, from the money I was saving for my kids. Does it make me a good father? No, I don't think so.

Gold just sighed to himself, how some kids acted like such idiots. It's just a game, chill out. Oh well, maybe that kid might become better and grow up.

Gold couldn't help but play, since fighting with pokémon was fun, but little kids like that seemed to ruin it for everyone. And what's worse, there were like 50 youngsters to come. *All* like little Joey. But they weren't in the top percentage, at least. He had a category all to himself.",,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,True,t3_18jy2q,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/18jy2q/pokémon_gold_top_percentage/,
