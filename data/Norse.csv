1323991546.0,42,self.Norse,nef81,Celebrate Yule like a Norseman!,AsaTJ,45,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/nef81/celebrate_yule_like_a_norseman/,"If anyone would like trying to celebrate Yule/Júl this year, here is what I usually do:

1. The night before the Winter Solstice (December 20th most years, it's actually the 21st this year since next year is a Leap Year), Sunna, the driver of the sun chariot, undertakes her darkest ride, leaving the world without her light for the longest night of the year.
The Ancient Germanic and Norse people would typically light a Yule log, and keep it tended from sunset to sunrise.  The collective light from all of the Yule logs across Midgard is said to help Sunna find her way back to the sky, with Sköll Fenrirsson hot on her heels, as the Solstice dawns.

If you don't have a fireplace or cannot get a log (and let's face it, it's harder than it used to be in the developed world), you can use a candle instead.  It's important in honoring the tradition to keep the candle lit until the sun has risen on the 21st (or 22nd in the case of this year.)  It is also important that your fire be, if not outside, at least close to a window where Sunna can see it.  Even if you are not a literal believer in gods and goddesses (like myself), this is the proper way to honor our ancestors' traditions.

2. After Mother's Night, the 12 Days of Yule begin.  This is a time of togetherness with your loved ones and celebration, having seen through the darkest moment of winter.  After the Solstice, each day grows brighter than the last, and even in our modern age of electric heating and lighting, that is cause for celebration.

Some years you may choose to spend Yule in a cabin with only a fire to warm you, as our ancestors did.  But if this is not possible or comfortable for you, be sure to at least contemplate your ancestors and the hardships they had to endure at this time of year in the frigid climes of Northern Europe, so that you could one day have the better life you have now.

Some things to do during Yule:

* Sit around and have some meaningful discussions with the people close to you.  The internet and Reddit will still be here when Yule is over, so try to make this a time with fewer menial distractions.  Write or tell a story, sing some songs- anything you can do as a group that fosters a sense of community.

* Put up a tree.  The ""Christmas Tree"" originally had nothing to do with Christmas whatsoever.  Our Germanic and Norse ancestors were decorating evergreens during Yule long before the Christians showed up.  In the Old Tradition, it is meant to represent Yggdrassil, the world tree that holds up the Nine Worlds of lore.  You can also admire the trees of your non-Heathen friends and relatives, knowing that they are unwittingly supporting the spurned beliefs of their ancestors as well.

* Drink some hot, spiced mead.  Trust me, you will thank me later.

* Give and receive gifts.  This is another tradition that predates Christianity among our ancestors.  The ancient Norse and Germanic culture highly valued the idea of ""A Gift for a Gift,"" so do your best to match the gifts given to you by others in turn... and don't give a gift that will be too difficult for the receiver to reciprocate.

* If you would like, you could try to enact a Blot/Faining to the gods and the Vaettir (wights/spirits) of the land around your house.  Again, you don't have to be theistic to do this.  The act honors your ancestors' traditions, even if you don't literally believe in supernatural forces.  And if you do, that's great.  With how little we really know about the universe, you might even be right.

I hope you find these tips helpful!  Feel free to add your own!

HAPPY YULE!

GOÐAN JÚL!


EDIT: My use of the term ""ancestors"" is not meant to exclude anyone from participating on the basis of blood.  If you are celebrating Yule in the first place, then the ancient Germanic and Norse pagans are at least your *cultural ancestors*, if not your genetic ones.

As soon as I was flying down unfamiliar windy woods roads  I felt like my old adventureouse self, all fresh and new(and I was in a bad funky mood before) Any ways I pass the sign for the Nordic Lodge, without thinking I turn around saying Ive never been to this place and Ive known about it for ever. Time to check it out

Im almost there, the place is in the middle of nowwhere(this is Rhode Island, so thats not saying much) and this guy with a long board pops out of the woods(yes in the middle of nowwhere) as I fly buy. I get to the place, stop in the parking lot, and here comes a 4 wheeler(little sports thing) with the long boarder dude in tow, comes up to me and tells me the story of the place.

The place is awsome nice lake, hammocks and stuff every where, eat all you can eat lobster and steak when its open,it was closed)  Like a Vallhalla. The guy tells me a guy who was there a few years before liked the place so much that he went out into the woods cut a tree down and carved a huge Thor statue out of it, its at the front door. I went over to Thor, pulled out my Mjollner and knocked on his knee. The ground didnt shake, thunder didnt crash but I felt like I had crossed over into sacred ground or something.

I'd like to welcome the new faces and thank the old faces for sticking around to see /r/norse's second christmas, there's been a lot of changes from when we had our first christmas message and looking back on it now a lot of the same stuff could be said for you guys once again. You're all brilliant people and fine scholars.

Here at /r/norse we used to say that we're all brothers and sisters, I considered it was because we sit under the same banner and share our love of history with each other, after watching over this place though i've learned that it's more than that, at any time this subreddit could have fell a part but you all put your bit in, threw in your 2 cents and spoke your opinions without fear of argument.

That can be a difficult thing to achieve on the internet.

Saying that we did have a spot of drama turn up in mid-season we fell off subject and we were all nearly turning our words against each other but we did not divide, we pulled together like a real family would and for that I'm really proud of us, of each of you.

So I think with that i'd like to end this annual post with how I ended last years:

Anyone care to comment on its feasibility, offer advice, anything?",ConanofCimmeria,36,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/141ot0/my_insane_longterm_dream_establishing_a_norse/,"So as you're undoubtedly aware, there are newly-built Norse ""towns"" here and there. The folks at Regia Anglorum have their own [longhall,](http://wychurst.regia.org/) for example, and there's the village of [Foteviken.](http://www.foteviken.se/) These places are awesome, but for a while I've been dreaming of doing something like this but on a somewhat larger scale.

I want to establish a very large ""commune,"" say on the scale of a [hundred.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_%28county_subdivision%29) For a few years I've been looking at forested land sales, and come to the conclusion Canada would be the proper place to do this - the climate is similar enough to Scandinavia, but land is very cheap, and I'd be buying a pretty vast quantity - say, a minimum of 3000 acres (1220 hectares.) The difference between this project and the others currently around is that this project would aim at being inhabited year-round, and more or less self-sufficient. As far as I know, the present establishments don't grow their own food, and typically are only inhabited in the summer months. 

I'm thinking I would rather manage this all privately, rather than with the establishment of some kind of non-profit organization, for the simple reason that I don't want to be beholden to anyone else. The goal would be to do everything entirely authentically, without concessions to modernity. I would imagine having to go through some sort of organization would result in increased regulation (constructing houses to building codes, health and safety regulations relating to the slaughter of animals, and so on) which as far as I'm concerned would undermine the point of the project.

I imagine how I would do this is by buying up vast quantities of land and then allowing people to rent from me. Perhaps they would initially pay for the privilege of the use of the land, which would be doled out in [hides,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_%28unit%29) after which they'd need to pay rent in the medieval fashion (a certain portion of their produce, labor for me, and so on.) This whole operation would of course be a vast money-drain, but I thought I could offset these costs by offering tours of the place, charging for a chance to live on the commune for a week to ""Experience Viking Daily Life!,"" and selling handwork and crafts. (I would imagine selling produce would be difficult, due to the fact that there's unlikely to be much to spare - after all, the margins of subsistence were narrow - and I would not be interested in registering as a commercial farm, submitting to food safety inspectors and so on.)

In addition to offering a chance to understand more practical matters - farming, forestry and so on - this commune would offer the chance to start some other interesting experiments. I'd be interested in trying to revive reconstructed Old Norse, for example, or see how proficient people might become in medieval military skills when in an environment where seriously training for two hours a day is a possibility. 

Obviously any such project would be quite a ways in the future. At the moment I'm still in my undergraduate studies, and I would imagine I would need to accumulate some not-insignificant capital (to the tune of several million dollars - time to start investing!) to start such a project, even if I was able to solicit donations and so on. I was wondering if anyone with a background in farming could weigh in on the practical aspects, or anyone with knowledge of law, nonprofit organization or anything else like this could offer advice on the organizational aspects of such a project.

Finally (and at the moment this is of course purely hypothetical,) would anyone be interested in taking part in such a project? It would require a huge time commitment - I would think anyone interested in being a tenant would need to commit to a minimum of about three years, to clear land, build a house, and establish a working farm. After the land is fairly well developed, it would be easier for newcomers to get involved - they might have the option of taking over the farm of someone moving on, or join an established household as a hired hand (during the *fardagar,* of course.) In exchange for the backbreaking labor, we'd come away with a truly unrivaled appreciation of daily life in the Norse era.

Thanks, and my apologies for the wall of text!

   This is Tyrsman, one of the more quiet moderators of this sub-reddit.
I have been watching our little community swell over the last few months and I have been glad, I am proud of the fact that our community is respectful and encouraging to all members, it really helps us as moderators, we have quite the load at times, I’m actually at work right now while I type this, so I am going to stick to form and keep it short.

It has come to our attention that there are some individuals in our fair community that don’t agree with others, now that is not a problem at all; the problem is how it is communicated, civility goes out the window, and harsh words are spoken. 

As moderators we attempt to be fair and impartial in disagreements, and we will post when necessary, but we had a flood of reports and messages due to certain individuals within the community. We now have to take some action.

We wouldn’t be very good moderators without listening to you guys, without you, we would not be moderators at all. So I have a few questions for you all, and we will listen to the general consensus and base our future actions on your response as a whole.

How far is too far? 
What would justify a ban?
What should we focus on in regards to dealing with troublesome individuals?

We really need your feedback so we can take action and keep our community peaceful, if you have suggestions feel free to message us, or post in the comments. Everyone has equal rights in this community. 

The last thing I ask of you is to bear in mind that we value arguments, as long as they are civil; without them, opinions will never change and neither will your perspective.

Mjollnir was the most powerful weapon that the gods posessed, and if their enemies heard that Mjollnir was missing then they might attack, and the gods would be powerless against them. Loki, the trickster god, had an idea about who had stolen Mjollnir, so he turned himself into a falcon and flew off to find Thrym, the king of the giants. When Loki found Thrym, the giant confessed that it was indeed him that had stolen the hammer while Thor slept. Thrym also said that he had hidden it in a place where no one could find it, and he would not return Mjollnir until Freyja, the most beautiful of all the the goddesses, was made his bride. Loki flew off to tell the gods the bad news. They debated and argued, but they came to the conclusion that Freyja must become Thrym's wife so that the hammer would be return. Freyja and the other gods started preparing for Freyja's wedding when the god Heimdall came up with an idea: Dress mighty Thor up in Freyja's clothing and send him to marry Thrym. Thor didn't like the idea of dressing up like a woman, but his disliked the idea of beautiful Freyja becoming Thrym's bride even more, so he reluctantly agreed. Thor, dressed as a bride, was accompanied by his ""handmaiden"" Loki to Thrym's castle. When Thor and Loki arrived, Thrym welcomed them in, and held a feast in their honour. Thor ate and entire ox, a net full of salmon, and six barrels of mead by himself, and when Thrym asked Loki why the ""maiden"" was eating so much Loki replied that she had not eaten for a week in anticipation of the wedding and was famished. Thinking that ""Freyja"" was really in love with him he decided to give her a kiss. Thrym lifted her vail and prepared to kiss his bride when he caught sight of her red eyes. Alarmed, he asked Loki why his bride's eyes looked the way that they did. Smoothly Loki replied that she had not slept for a week either, and would be fine once she had had a chance to rest. Dim-witted Thrym accepted this and decided to make his bride wait no longer for the wedding. Fetching Mjollnir and holding it aloft he prepared to bless the union when Thor could take it no longer. He ripped off his bridal clothes, grabbed his hammer, and beat all of the giants to death with it, starting with Thrym.

",sondre12321,28,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/nemeh/my_family_did_some_ancestry_research_and_we_found/,"My grandmother passed away recently, so me and my family decided that we invested some money to hire a company to do some family research for us. 

Averøya is a small Island close to the capital of the region, Kristiansund (also known for its vikings Kings and battles). As it turns out my family for the last 19 generations have lived on the Island, myself included (moved to Oslo 12 years ago though). Both Averøya and Kristiansund has been populated since after the ice age, and were reliable places to live due to usable soil, and amazing fishing opportunities, which was obviously what the communities of that time were living of.

The place where my parents and grandparents grew up is just 2 km away from the Viking monument ""Forliket i langøysundet"", where the kings &amp; jarls, among them Svein, son of Knut den mektige (Knut the mighty), Einar Tambarskjelve, Kalv Arneson and King olav's son, Magnus had a meeting after the fall of Olav Harraldson.

According to church logs and birth registers my viking Jarl ancestor was Gérdolv den sterke (Gérdolv the strong) traced back to somewhere around the peak of the 11th century. While there is not much information around my long lost ancestor, they are still speculating if he is the person who got lost his life under a major storm while he was fishing, which there are also several sentences about, but from different and perhaps not to reliable sources from that time.

At least now I can confirm where my blonde hair &amp; blue eyes come from now :)

A Couple of questions:

* The texts doesn't make any sense. Thats not proto-/old norse/germanic.

* the ? are simply not runes, and the (?) is a rune of a different/wrong Futhark

* The second Rune in the first word is not allowed to be used inside a word. This Rune simply marks the ending of maskuline Substantive, and is only used at the end of Names

* When writing in Runes, theres is normaly no space between words, and your are not allowed to use the same Letter after each other. So between the second and third word, the (invented) rune is only allowed to be there once

I have four currently available, all of a slightly different style. These will be on a first come, fist serve basis but if you'd like one and they're all gone, just say and I'll PM you when I make some more. Also, if you want one of a different style, ask and I can make on for you! I can even make keyrings and bottle openers if that is of interest to any of you! Similarly, custom runes are also welcomed!

Anyway, here's the four I have now:

I then embarked on a self-study adventure, attempting to immerse myself in the language and its intricacies.  Scholarship is far less for ON than for many other languages, so it wasn't easy.

The first thing I did, under the advice of my wife, was to consult a professor of Norse at the University of Reykjavik.  He suggested two books.  One is a New Introduction to Old Norse, by Michael Barnes.  This book is crap, but is apparently regarded as the best source for English speakers.  I read it in entirety almost just to say I did.  Another is An Introduction to Old Norse, by EV Gordon, which I am reading now.  It's more of a reader, presenting exemplar texts with translations.  It has a nice Appendix and a shitty glossary, so I'm often looking stuff up on the online Norse dictionary called Cleasby-Vigfusson at http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oi_cleasbyvigfusson_about.html

One surprisingly useful website was the Indo-European Studies site at the University of Texas at Austin, at http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/norol-TC-X.html

It's got a fairly complete series of lessons.  Some of it is overkill but it offers a useful addition to the Barnes book, which is utterly atrocious and pretentious.  

I'm now at the point where I can read Norse text fairly rapidly as long as I have a dictionary close by.  I can't call myself expert by any means, but I feel confident about my progress and am coming along.

I'm agnostic but very interested in Norse mythology, and I've recently been researching it. I'm a bit confused about one area in particular, though. Upon reading about the Ragnarok, I realised that it's describing it as already having happened(what with Odin being killed, etc. etc.), which confused me.

**When was the Ragnarok believed to have actually occured?** And if it happened whilst the Norse gods were still being worshipped, what happened to the Vikings? If someone could just explain this to me, I'd be forever grateful! I've had trouble finding an answer on Wikipedia, and various other history websites, so I thought you guys might be able to help out.

I've got a question for you kind folks. I've frequently seen Norse paganism referred to as a religion of the social elites, usually offhandedly. I understand this has to do with the popularity of Thor with the ""common people"" while the upper classes are presumed to have felt more of an affinity with Odin, but some claims seem to go farther than this in stating that the whole affair was the purview of the elites alone. 

My question, then, is what the evidence is for this? It's a claim repeated frequently enough in scholarly literature, but I've never seen any kind of discussion about *why* people think this. If what we think of as the Norse pantheon was fairly exclusively affiliated with the upper classes, what did the ""99%"" believe? Perhaps a greater emphasis on the Vanir?

Typically, Saturday is known to be Saturn's day, but wouldn't it make more sense for it to be Surtur's day? But also, could Friday not be Frey(r)'s day? it would follow suit with this ""theme.""

Ymir is formed from the clash of fire and ice from Muspelheim and Nifelheim. The cold molecular cloud that our solar system began in formed in the cold (Nifelheim) of empty space (Ginnungagap) and from the remnants of an exploding star gone supernova (Muspelheim). Ymir was not alone. Also created was a cow named Audhumla. Ymir drank of her milk to sustain himself. The cold molecular cloud eventually collapsed inward and then forced gas out into a protoplanetary disc. The core then ""fed"" off this disc of gas and debris to form a protostar. Ymir was then killed by the other Gods. His remains were used to create the *nine* worlds. The protostar eventually became our Sun. The debris it threw out into its disc collided and accumulated into the *nine* planets.

Another interesting parallel is the story of Surtr. It is said that Surtr will one day rise from Muspelheim brandishing a flaming sword, which he will use to kill Freyr and then engulf the Earth during the events of Ragnarok. Interestingly, the Sun is estimated to one day use up its fuel sources expanding into a Red Giant, possibly engulfing the Earth in the process, before becoming a White Dwarf. It's interesting to parallel. They had nine worlds in a tree called Yggdrasil. We have nine planets in our solar system.

Another one is about Thor. ""Thor"" is from Germanic languages and ultimately means ""thunder"". Thor married Sif, a goddess whom is associated with the Earth. Thor is said to protect Midgard and Sif from the beings of Utgardar; the outyards that surround the giant stronghold. Consider the yards as space and the giants as being celestial bodies; asteroids and the like.

The halls Thor (thunder) resides in are called Bilskirner (lightning). These halls are located within Thrudhvangr which can be translated as ""power field"". The Earth's upper atmosphere (where Thor is depicted, in the Sky) **is**, in fact, electrically charged and the Earth's electromagnetic field does help protect it from things outside of it. Thor's hammer, Mjorlnir, can be translated to ""crusher"" or ""grinder"" which is precisely what space rocks do when they enter the Earth's atmosphere. They are pulverized.

1 Listen you (who are) in this hall,

inside of them

how early it made him smile

gone into another world (dead)





2 Gestur(name which means ""guest"") walks lost from the hall, 

he's blind and silent;

he meets an old man.

covered in grey hair.





3 He met an old man,

covered in grey hair:

""Why are you, Gestur blind, wild,

why are you so few. (few of words)





4 ""It is not so strange,

that I'm reluctant to speak:

The riddles cause me trouble,

tomorrow I'll lose my neck.





5 It is not so strange,

That I'm so depressed:

The riddles cause me trouble,

tomorrow I'll loose my life.





6 ""How much redgold

will you give me,

I'll walk inn for Heiðrik king

riddles I know there.

7 Twelve marks in redgold,

shall be yours,

if you walk in for Heiðrik king,

and save my head.

8 Walk in the gardens

and look to your dwelling:

I'm going in before Heiðrik king

riddles I know now

9 ""Thirty are the riddles,

guess me one of them:

What is the name of the red drum,

that beats all over the world""?

10 ""I know the riddle,

I guess the first of them:

Thunder is the name of the red drum,

that beats all over the world"".

11 Listen Heiðrik, my king,

where do you know these neighbors:

Both walk through one door,

and neither knows the other?

12 My mind and your mind

they are neighbors

both walk through the same door,

but neither know the other. 

13 Listen Heiðrik, my king,

where do you know the brothers:

Lying out on outskeries,

but don't have a father or mother?

14 Easternwind and Westernwind

could well be called brothers,

lying out on the outskeries,

and neither having father nor mother.

15 Listen Heiðrik, my king,

what might that be:

Soft as down, white as snow

and hard as the hard horn?

16 Listen Gestur blind,

I might know the riddle:

The sea is both soft and hard,

the surf crashes white against land.

17 Listen Heiðrik, my king,

Where does this tree grow,

its root disappears upp into the sky,

and the sharp end disappears downwards?

18 Icesicle in the cliffs up high,

she is no tree,

the root disappears to heaven high,

and the sharp end disappears downwards.

19 Listen Heiðrik, my king,

Where do you know the woods, 

cut they are each holy, (weekend)

and yet there's lots of trees?

20 The beard is on each mans chin,

that is no wood,

it is shaped each holy (weekend)

yet there's lots of wood.

21 Listen Heiðrik, my king,

where do you know those brothers, 

they grow up in a hall,

and yet have no father nor mother?

22 Peatblock and burning stone(coal),

they are brothers,

grow up in a hall(as a fire),

and do not have a father nor mother.

23 The sow walks to her bower,

falls softly on green ground,

galts grunt, pigs squeal,

from each their mouths? (or ""from the same mouth?"" don't know what fits best"")

24 I know the riddle,

in this I tell the truth:

A hammer is in every smithy,

it falls simple as that.

25 I should know the riddle,

is not me on that hill: (this line really confused my translation skills...)

Odin rides his horse

both on land and sea.

26 I know the riddle, 


I'm not going in that way:

Odin rides on his horse

both at day and night.

27 Odin turned into a wild bird,

and flew out off the hall,

burnt inn Heiðrik king

and the entire court.

flew out to sea,

burnt in Heiðrik king

""Vi hugge med kaarde(kårde)"" is a rewriting of ""Krákumal"" into a more ""modern"" language by Peder Syv (1631-1702) 

""Krákumál or the Lay of Kraka is a skaldic poem, consisting of a monologue in which Ragnar Lodbrok is dying in Ælla's snake pit and looks back at a life full of heroic deeds. It was composed in the 12th century, almost certainly in the Scottish islands.[1] It is composed in a kind of háttlausa with stanzas of ten lines.

In moving and forceful language, the poem deals with the joys of the life of a warrior, the hope that his death will be followed by a gory revenge, and the knowledge that he will soon know the pleasures of Valhalla."" (from wikipedia)

Not a creature was stirring, not warrior nor thrall.
And I in my armor, my shield and my helm
Was drunker than anyone else in the Realm.

I staggered upstairs and fell into bed
While four quarts of mead were ablaze in my head.
Then up from below came the sounds of a brawl
So I grabbed up my axe and ran down to the Hall.

I missed the last step and crashed down in a heap
Thinking, ""Why can't those low-lifes downstairs go to sleep!""
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But two brawny strangers, wielding mallet and spear.

I said to myself, ""We'll soon have them beat!""
Then I noticed ten warriors laid out at their feet.
I gave out a yell and leapt into the fray...
I'll always regret my poor choice of that day.

For the one laid his hammer to the side of my nose
And up, up, up to the rafters I rose.
Then came a lone frightened voice from the floor,
""Those are no mortal warriors -- that's Odin and Thor!""

Then they looked at each other and they said, ""Battle's done.
Now they know who we are, it no longer is fun.""
Then Thor raised his hammer, and his elbow he bent,
And with a loud crash, through the ceiling they went.

I crawled through the Hall and flung open the door,
Not really sure that I'd seen them before.
The snow bathed in starlight, the moon like a glede,
I saw them ride off on an eight-legged steed.

And I heard them exclaim, 'ere they flew out of sight,
""TO HELL WITH CHRISTMAS, WE JUST LOVE A GOOD FIGHT!""

All door-ways, before going forward, should be looked to; for difficult it is to know where foes may sit within a dwelling.
2. Givers, hail! A guest is come in: where shall he sit? In much haste is he, who on the ways has to try his luck.
3. Fire is needful to him who is come in, and whose knees are frozen; food and raiment a man requires, wheo'er the fell has travelled.
4. Water to him is needful who for refection comes, a towel and hospitable invitation, a good reception; if he can get it, discourse and answer.
5. Wit is needful to him who travels far: at home all is easy. A laughing-stock is he who nothing knows, and with the instructed sits.
6. Of his understanding no one should be proud, but rather in conduct cautious. When the prudent and taciturn come to a dwelling, harm seldom befalls the cautious; for a firmer friend no man ever gets than great sagacity.
7. A wary guest, who to refection comes, keeps a cautious silence, with his ears listens, and with his eyes observes: so explores every prudent man.
8. He is happy, who for himself obtains fame and kind words: less sure is that which a man must have in another's breast.
9. He is happy, who in himself possesses fame and wit while living; for bad counsels have oft been received from another's breast.
10. A better burthen no man bears on the way than much good sense; that is thought better than riches in a strange place; such is the recourse of the indigent.
11. A worse provision on the way he cannot carry than too much beer-bibbing; so good is not, as it is said, beer for the sons of men.
12. A worse provision no man can take from table than too much beer-bibbing: for the more he drinks the less control he has of his own mind.
13. Oblivion's heron 'tis called that over potations hovers; he steals the minds of men. With this bird's pinions I was fettered in Gunnlods dwelling.
14. Drunk I was, I was over-drunk, at that cunning Fialar's. It's the best drunkenness, when every one after it regains his reason.
15. Taciturn and prudent, and in war daring, should a king's children be; joyous and liberal every one should be until his hour of death.
16. A cowardly man thinks he will ever live, if warfare he avoids; but old age will give him no peace, though spears may spare him.
17. A fool gapes when to a house he comes, to himself mutters or is silent; but all at once, if he gets drink, then is the man's mind displayed.
18. He alone knows who wanders wide, and has much experienced, by what disposition each man is ruled, who common sense possesses.
19. Let a man hold the cup, yet of the mead drink moderately, speak sensibly or be silent. As of a fault no man will admonish thee, if thou goest betimes to sleep.
20. A greedy man, if he be not moderate, eats to his mortal sorrow. Oftentimes his belly draws laughter on a silly man, who among the prudent comes.
21. Cattle know when to go home, and then from grazing cease; but a foolish man never knows his stomach's measure.
22. A miserable man, and ill-conditioned, sneers at every thing: one thing he knows not, which he ought to know, that he is not free from faults.
23. A foolish man is all night awake, pondering over everything; he then grows tired; and when morning comes, all is lament as before.
24. A foolish man thinks all who on him smile to be his friends; he feels it not, although they speak ill of him, when he sits among the clever.
25. A foolish man thinks all who speak him fair to be his friends; but he will find, if into court he comes, that he has few advocates.
26. A foolish man thinks he knows everything if placed in unexpected difficulty; but he knows not what to answer, if to the test he is put.
27. A foolish man, who among people comes, had best be silent; for no one knows that he knows nothing, unless he talks too much. He who previously knew nothing will still know nothing, talk he ever so much.
28. He thinks himself wise, who can ask questions and converse also; conceal his ignorance no one can, because it circulates among men.
29. He utters too many futile words who is never silent; a garrulous tongue, if it be not checked, sings often to its own harm.
30. For a gazing-stock no man shall have another, although he come a stranger to his house. Many a one thinks himself wise, if he is not questioned, and can sit in a dry habit.
31. Clever thinks himself the guest who jeers a guest, if he takes to flight. Knows it not certainly he who prates at meat, whether he babbles among foes.
32. Many men are mutually well-disposed, yet at table will torment each other. That strife will ever be; guest will guest irritate.
33. Early meals a man should often take, unless to a friend's house he goes; else he will sit and mope, will seem half-famished, and can of few things inquire.
34. Long is and indirect the way to a bad friend's, though by the road he dwell; but to a good friend's the paths lie direct, though he be far away.
35. A guest should depart, not always stay in one place. The welcome becomes unwelcome, if he too long continues in another's house.
36. One's own house is best, small though it be; at home is every one his own master. Though he but two goats possess, and a straw-thatched cot, even that is better than begging.
37. One's own house is best, small though it be, at home is every one his own master. Bleeding at heart is he, who has to ask for food at every meal-tide.
38. Leaving in the field his arms, let no man go a foot's length forward; for it is hard to know when on the way a man may need his weapon.
39. I have never found a man so bountiful, or so hospitable that he refused a present; or of his property so liberal that he scorned a recompense.
40. Of the property which he has gained no man should suffer need; for the hated oft is spared what for the dear was destined. Much goes worse than is expected.
41. With arms and vestments friends should each other gladden, those which are in themselves most sightly. Givers and requiters are longest friends, if all else goes well.
42. To his friend a man should be a friend, and gifts with gifts requite. Laughter with laughter men should receive, but leasing with lying.
43. To his friend a man should be a friend; to him and to his friend; but of his foe no man shall the friend's friend be.
44. Know, if thou hast a friend whom thou fully trustest, and from whom thou woulds't good derive, thou shouldst blend thy mind with his, and gifts exchange, and often go to see him.
45. If thou hast another, whom thou little trustest, yet wouldst good from him derive, thou shouldst speak him fair, but think craftily, and leasing pay with lying.
46. But of him yet further, whom thou little trustest, and thou suspectest his affection; before him thou shouldst laugh, and contrary to thy thoughts speak: requital should the gift resemble.
47. I was once young, I was journeying alone, and lost my way; rich I thought myself, when I met another. Man is the joy of man.
48. Liberal and brave men live best, they seldom cherish sorrow; but a base-minded man dreads everything; the niggardly is uneasy even at gifts.
49. My garments in a field I gave away to two wooden men: heroes they seemed to be, when they got cloaks: exposed to insult is a naked man.
50. A tree withers that on a hill-top stands; protects it neither bark nor leaves: such is the man whom no one favours: why should he live long?
51. Hotter than fire love for five days burns between [Pg 35]false friends; but is quenched when the sixth day comes, and-friendship is all impaired.
52. Something great is not always to be given, praise is often for a trifle bought. With half a loaf and a tilted vessel I got myself a comrade.
53. Little are the sand-grains, little the wits, little the minds of some men; for all men are not wise alike: men are everywhere by halves.
54. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise: of those men the lives are fairest, who know much well.
55. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise; for a wise man's heart is seldom glad, if he is all-wise who owns it.
56. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise. His destiny let know no man beforehand; his mind will be freest from' care.
57. Brand burns from brand until it is burnt out; fire is from fire quickened. Man to' man becomes known by speech, but a fool by his bashful silence.
58. He should early rise, who another's property or life desires to have. Seldom a sluggish wolf gets prey, or a sleeping man victory.
59. Early should rise he who has few workers, and go his work to see to; greatly is he retarded who sleeps the morn away. Wealth half depends on energy.

The earth did not exist, nor the sky above. There was a mighty chasm, Ginnungagap; but grass grew nowhere.

It was many ages before the earth was created that Niflheimr was made, and in its midst lies a spring or well called Hvergelmir, resting atop the the nidafjoll. From there flows the rivers Svol, Gunnpro, Fjorm, Fimbulpul, Slidr and hrid, Sylgr and Ylgr, Vid, Leiptr and Gjoll. Gjoll lies next to Helgrindar and Leiptar is so holy that sacred oaths are sworn upon it. All of these rivers are known collectively as Elivagar. Hvergelmir flowed north of Ginnungagap, enveloping niflheimer in mist and cold.

First, there was that world in the southern region which is called Sokkdalir or Utgardr, in Helheimr. It is bright and hot. that area is flaming and burning and was impassable for those that were foreigners there and were not native to it. Also in Helheimr the fountain of warmth and strength giving liquids, called Urdarbrunnr, is to be found. There was no sun to shine.

Between these two regions lies the well of wisdom, Mimisbrunnr, where Ginnungagap once was. When the Elivagar river cames so far from their source, the kvikudropar hardened like a slag of cinders running from a furnace, and became ice. When this ice began to solidify and no longer run, kvikudropar spewed out and froze into an icy rime. Then, layer by layer, the ice grew withing Ginnungagap.

That part of Ginnungagap, which reached into the northern regions, became filled with thick ice and rime. Inside the gap there was mist and wind-whipped rain. But the southern part of Ginnungagap grew light because of sparks and glowing embers from Helheimr. Sparks flew from the south-world: the fire gave life to the ice.

Jast as coldness and all the things grim came from Niflheimr, the regions close to Helheimr in the south were hot and bright, but Ginnungagap was as mild as a windless sky.

* Senses on par with a wolf.

* They get their powers from being a vessel for a predatory spirit (I'm being intentionally vague here, don't want to go into a long-ass explanation that has nothing to do with the topic)
* And the obvious, feel no pain when they don't want to, and very good at being stabbed and not dying.  Heal at normal human speeds when awake and not berserk, but can heal most moderate injuries during a good night's sleep.  Major injuries take longer.

&gt;Men who wot of that what was worked

&gt;In long-passed times, told in tales,

&gt;Hail the Hundings, of heroic deeds,

&gt;Who in Wendland ere waged war.

&gt;Truly are told tales of tribe-kings,

&gt;Ybor and Agio, apt at arms.

&gt;In ages long lost they left their lands,

&gt;And followed them folk to foreign places,

&gt;Sailing south to shores unseen.

&gt;On coming to this coast, the kind-hearted kings

&gt;Gave out gold, gladly granted, 

&gt;To settle scores. But Skoring-folk

&gt;Rebuffed these riches, rejected rings.

&gt;Ambri and Assi were the athel among them.

&gt;Haughty headmen, they harrowed the Hundings,

&gt;And swore not settle short of submission.

&gt;The sons of Gambara gave no ground,

&gt;Battling their banes with brand and sword,

&gt;Till Wulfling-folk fled their foes.

&gt;That was a victory very well-won!

&gt;The Skorings are said to have settled with Saxons.

&gt;Gambara-kin ruled, their reigns rich,

&gt;And in death were dealt no less than their due.

&gt;More gold and gifts greater were never given,

&gt;Nor more fitting a fire, than at folk-king's funeral.


Some of this stuff is a rather direct ""translation"" - those of you who know Beowulf will know what's up with ""tribe-king"" or ""folk-king,"" for example. Occasionally word order is weird, making use of the last remnants of English's erstwhile case system (""and followed them folk to foreign places."")

Weren't they just a bunch of rapers and pillagers? Looters and defilers?"" Never have I heard such a powerful lie. Upon delving into this culture, I've noticed some very powerful cultural ideologies. Many of which I honestly believed in before I considered myself a fan of Scandinavia. In the comments below I will link the longer quotes I've found about Vikings that have resonated with me, on both an ideological and historical basis.

Let me preface the following with the acknowledgement that I'm an atheist. I do not believe in the Nordic Gods, or any gods for that matter. Its the culture and way of life that the Scandinavians of old built that so interests me. Now, some examples of why pre-medieval Scandinavian culture and history is an endlessly enjoyable academic topic for me. To sum up, so that this post isn't a giant wall of text, the Nine Noble Virtues and the acceptance of mortality are the two pinnacles of their ideology that I really love. The way H. R. Ellis Davidson puts it:
""In spite of this awareness of fate, or perhaps because of it, the picture of man's qualities that emerges from the myths is a noble one. The gods are heroic figures, men writ large, who led dangerous, individualistic lives, yet at the same time were part of a closely-knit small group, with a firm sense of values and certain intense loyalties. They would give up their lives rather than surrender these values, but they would fight on as long as they could, since life was well worth while. Men knew that the gods whom they served could not give them freedom from danger and calamity, and they did not demand that they should. We find in the myths no sense of bitterness at the harshness or unfairness of life, but rather the spirit of heroic resignation: humanity is born to trouble, but courage, adventure, and the wonders of life are matters for thankfulness, to be enjoyed while life is still granted to us. The great gifts of the gods were readiness to face the world as it was, the luck that sustained men in tight places, and the opportunity to win that glory which alone can outlive death.""

The second big thing I love about the Vikings is their love for words, both oral and written. It may seem contradictory to think that, given that they raided, pillaged and burned many Christian churches, and the literature and records they held. This very well may be true, but they had an understanding of how powerful and lasting words can be. By passing down stories from generation to generation, you implicitly create the only thing we humans can make everlasting, the reality of our reputation. Its the only thing left behind when we die. And since they knew that every man is mortal, they did all they could for kin and country to be immortalized in skaldic poetry and stories. The following two quotes, which I found on various youtube videos, sum up exactly what I'm talking about.
""More than their warrior image and wide-ranging conquests, the Viking's most valuable heritage is found in their love for words, their passion for memory, their sense of beauty, and their powerful drive to explore the world in search of a better place to live, and prosper. The worldwide and sustained fascination for the Vikings endures. Thousands of companies, products, sports teams, and even space probes bear the name Viking. It is a badge of honor; a symbol of conquest and exploration. The best of the Viking Spirit sails on.""
""Cattle die, kindred die, every man is mortal. But the good name never dies of one who has done well.""

So, when people ask me the question at the beginning of this post, knowing what I know, I often say, ""How can I not?"" To most, that loaded response is over their head, but that is not their fault. If they seem genuinely interested, I'll explain it to them.",,False,self,t5_2scl4,False,,,True,t3_1ke8nh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/1ke8nh/a_facebook_post_i_just_created_let_me_know_what/,

Does anybody  here have a read on how such actions would have been viewed at the time? I know that there are attestations of human skin being made into a suit or a pair of shoes for witchcraft purposes, but I could imagine that not only was such a thing not common place, such practice would be negatively viewed.

The aim is to each day make people a little bit more knowledgeable on a random topic.

The first topic starts on Friday (tomorrow), and is 'Norse Mythology', so I thought I would post in here, in hope that maybe some of you Norse experts would have anything interesting to post to enlighten the Reddit community. If you get chance at all tomorrow, and have any interesting knowledge/links/pictures, I would be very thankful if you could post them in the subreddit.

1315170970.0,11,self.Norse,k4ojz,Hello. I'm an author in need of wisdom from fellow Norsophiles. ,jon819,11,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/k4ojz/hello_im_an_author_in_need_of_wisdom_from_fellow/,"I am currently writing a series of eight novels which deal heavily with the mythology of Norse Paganism. Each book contains three or four story arcs, one of which is centered around Asgard and its politics, the rest of which are centered mostly in Midgard during the transition between longboats and mead-halls to steel and castles. The stories are high fantasy and come to their climax at Ragnarok, the aftermath of which will expel the fantasy aspects and give way to ""reality"".

So, I have a question for you all. Writing a story around the Norse mythos is a daunting task to say the least, as there are already hundreds upon hundreds of pages written, detailing long bloodlines, great heroes, fantastic events, etc. If I were to force myself to include all of this lore most readers would become bored, as there would be no pages left to actually build my story and my own characters. Therefore, simplification is necessary. 

My question: At what point would simplification annoy you, as fans of the Norse myths? I am forced to write for the lowest common denominator, and cannot possibly expect readers to already have a firm understanding of Norse lore when they first pick up one of my stories. 

Example: The cast of Asgard, from what I've read, contains hundreds of unique characters in the actual myths. For simplicity, I need to cut this down to about thirty, at most (since the Midgard arcs will have thirty or forty unique characters, also). Do you think that I should take several paragraphs to explain why these characters are no longer around, or should I simply not mention them? I'm tempted to do the former...but this would mean conjuring a war or a conflict of some sort; another act which may annoy Norsophiles rather than placate them.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**tl;dr**: When writing stories dealing with Norse lore, it is impossible to include *everything*, due to the sheer vastness of the lore. How much creative license can an author exercise before infuriating the members of his audience who already have a deep knowledge of the myths?",,False,self,t5_2scl4,True,,,True,t3_k4ojz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/k4ojz/hello_im_an_author_in_need_of_wisdom_from_fellow/,

What lies behind and what awaits for thee



Make the toil, if you believe you must

Has an ingenious plan to snare you too

Spam filter is still being as it has always been and if your post isn't showing up let us know ASAP! Still working on the banner, we have the banner submitted by a user but it ~~will not upload to the site~~ **a test banner has been put up for now**, we'll keep trying. Also any sugestions on anything to improve the board are all welcome we will read every single message and will probably reply to them all too so don't be a stranger.

Now the traffic stats, I like to check up on traffic every 2 months to see how we're growing and it's been a very impressive rise:

As you can see April this year was our busiest month so far, last year it was May so who knows maybe next year it will be March.

Our userbase is nearly at 2000 so i'm thinking that when we get to that putting a little '2k' in the logo or something, if anyone wants to make a design then we'll pop it up there.

I'm hoping that we'll reach 2k users by christmas eve or by looking at the progression of uniques we can assume it will be last day of the year which would make for a nice end to 2012. Also looking at Thor 2 to be bringing in some new users who want to learn so when they do be nice to them.

Besides the stats we can look towards maybe adding some new bits for Winter on /r/Norse so if anyone has any background images to submit go right ahead for that, in fact if anyone wants any new images for the background submit them to me and we'll alternate them fortnightly.

Anyways I think that's everything for now as always any suggestions can be mailed to me or Tyrsman or even put in this thread and i'll be sure to read and respond whenever I can.

But what books should I get? I'm primarily looking for books that actually tell their stories and not just list interesting facts about them. Something to dive in and where I can lose myself in the stories. But accurate enough that I can be sure I'm not just reading an interpretation of the Norse Mythology by some Author.

I researched a little myself and apparently the Prose Edda is a very important book about the Norse Mythology. I ordered it a few days ago (haven't even checked if it's story based or just plain information) and I'm eagerly awaiting its arrival.

It seems to me that in the first five books there are a few similarities between the Odyssey and Egil's Saga. They're a bit of a stretch, and I may be grasping at straws, but I think it's kind of interesting.

The first is that Odysseus' plight in a way resembles Thorolf Kveldulfsson. Odysseus is called into military service (whereas Thorolf volunteered) and this causes their downfalls. Yes I realize that Odysseus eventually makes it out alright. Both of these men's wives become involved in heritage feuds (Penelope with her suitors, Sigrid with her Hraerek and Harek, causing Thorolf's demise.) 

Secondly, Telemachos resembles Skallagrim, in that he must get justice/closure for Odysseus in the same way Skallagrim must for Thorolf. Both of these men had to leave their respective homes to do so, and were helped along the way. Telemachos was helped by Nestor, Menelaus and Mentes/Athene, while Skallagrim was helped by Olvir Hump. Also, both Telemachos and Skallagrim set out with a nominal amount of men. Telemachos goes with 20 men, Skallagrim with 12.

Thirdly, both men avenge the parties responsible for their lieges downfalls. Telemachos eventually kills his mother's suitors, and Skallagrim (with Kveldulf) kills the men who plotted and carried out the murder of Thorolf.

I know this is a bit far fetched, but I've read that many Icelandic authors were aware of Greek poetry and mythology, so, if we were to assume that both stories were non-historical and entirely mythological or apocryphal, it is reasonable to assume that the author of Egil's Saga (in my mind, Snorri Sturluson, who also compiled the Prose Edda, which speaks of the Trojan War) had a working knowledge of Ancient Greek literature

TL;DR- The Odyssey and Egil's saga bear some resemblance.",,False,self,t5_2scl4,False,,,True,t3_ytmre,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/ytmre/the_odyssey_and_egils_saga/,

So I am introducing two new sub-reddits!

For the literary side, I have created r/Skald! Anything literary is welcome there, poems, stories, books, basically anything that you can think of!

and for the music side I have created r/Nordicbards! any music viking or Norse inspired is welcome there from folk to viking melodic metal!

We are going to link these two into the side bar of r/norse so it's easy to navigate and is all connected so depending on your mood, you can choose what you want! I am also debating on having an art section for pictures and paintings etc. Tell me what you think!

I apologize for the barrenness of the pages, but I have just created them and so I need you folks to fill them up! 

While that is happening, we will work on making them more aesthetically pleasing for you!

61. Washed and refected let a man ride to the [Pg 36]Thing, although his garments be not too good; of his shoes and breeches let no one be ashamed, nor of his horse, although he have not a good one.
62. Inquire and impart should every man of sense, who will be accounted sage. Let one only know, a second may not; if three, all the world knows.
63. Gasps and gapes, when to the sea he comes, the eagle over old ocean; so is a man, who among many comes, and has few advocates.
64. His power should every sagacious man use with discretion; for he will find, when among the bold he comes, that no one alone is doughtiest.
65. Circumspect and reserved every man should be, and wary in trusting friends. Of the words that a man says to another he often pays the penalty.
66. Much too early I came to many places, but too late to others: the beer was drunk, or not ready: the disliked seldom hits the moment.
67. Here and there I should have been invited, if I a meal had needed; or two hams had hung, at that true friend's, where of one I had eaten.
68. Fire is best among the sons of men, and the sight of the sun, if his health a man can have, with a life free from vice.
69. No man lacks everything, although his health be bad: one in his sons is happy, one in his kin, one in abundant wealth, one in his good works.
70. It is better to live, even to live miserably; a living man can always get a cow. I saw fire consume the rich man's property, and death stood without his door.
71. The halt can ride on horseback, the one-handed drive cattle; the deaf fight and be useful: to be blind is better than to be burnt no one gets good from a corpse.
72. A son is better, even if born late, after his father's departure. Gravestones seldom stand by the way-side unless raised by a kinsman to a kinsman.
73. Two are adversaries: the tongue is the bane of the head: under every cloak I expect a hand. 
74. At night is joyful he who is sure of travelling entertainment. A ship's yards are short. Variable is an autumn night. Many are the weather's changes in five days, but more in a month.
75. He only knows not who knows nothing, that many a one apes another. One man is rich, another poor: let him not be thought blameworthy.
76. Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves also die; but the fair fame never dies of him who has earned it.
77. Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves also die; but I know one thing that never dies,—judgment on each one dead.
78. Full storehouses I saw at Dives' sons': now bear they the beggar's staff. Such are riches; as is the twinkling of an eye: of friends they are most fickle.
79. A foolish man, if he acquires wealth or woman's love, pride grows within him, but wisdom never: he goes on more and more arrogant.
80. Then 'tis made manifest, if of runes thou questionest him, those to the high ones known, which the great powers invented, and the great talker painted, that he had best hold silence.
81. At eve the day is to be praised, a woman after she is burnt, a sword after it is proved, a maid after she is married, ice after it has passed away, beer after it is drunk.
82. In the wind one should hew wood, in a breeze row out to sea, in the dark talk with a lass: many are the eyes of day. In a ship voyages are to be made, but a shield is for protection, a sword for striking, but a damsel for a kiss.
83. By the fire one should drink beer, on the ice slide; buy a horse that is lean, a sword that is rusty; feed a horse at home, but a dog at the farm.
84. In a maiden's words no one should place faith, nor in what a woman says; for on a turning wheel have their hearts been formed, and guile in their breasts been laid;
85. In a creaking bow, a burning flame, a yawning wolf, a chattering crow, a grunting swine, a rootless tree, a waxing wave, a boiling kettle,
86. A flying dart, a falling billow, a one night's ice, a coiled serpent, a woman's bed-talk, or a broken sword, a bear's play, or a royal child,
87. A sick calf, a self-willed thrall, a flattering prophetess, a corpse newly slain, a serene sky, a laughing lord, a barking dog, and a harlot's grief.
88. An early sown field let no one trust, nor prematurely in a son: weather rules the field, and wit the son, each of which is doubtful.
89. A brother's murderer, though on the high road met, a half-burnt house, an over-swift horse, a horse is useless, if a leg be broken, no man is so confiding as to trust any of these.
90. Such is the love of women, who falsehood meditate, as if one drove not rough-shod, on slippery ice, a spirited two-years old and unbroken horse; or as in a raging storm a helmless ship is beaten; or as if the halt were set to catch a reindeer in the thawing fell.
91. Openly I now speak, because I both sexes know: unstable are men's minds towards women; 'tis then we speak most fair when we most falsely think: that deceives even the cautious.
92. Fair shall speak, and money offer, who would obtain a woman's love. Praise the form of a fair damsel; he gets who courts her.
93. At love should no one ever wonder in another: a beauteous countenance oft captivates the wise, which captivates not the foolish.
94. Let no one wonder at another's folly, it is the lot of many. All-powerful desire makes of the sons of men fools even of the wise.
95. The mind only knows what lies near the heart, that alone is conscious of our affections. No disease is worse to a sensible man than not to be content with himself.
96. That I experienced, when in the reeds I sat, awaiting my delight. Body and soul to me was that discreet maiden: nevertheless I possess her not.
97. Billing's lass on her couch I found, sun-bright, sleeping. A prince's joy to me seemed naught, if not with that form to live.
98. ""Yet nearer eve must thou, Odin, come, if thou wilt talk the maiden over; all will be disastrous, unless we alone are privy to such misdeed.""
99. I returned, thinking to love, at her wise desire. I thought I should obtain her whole heart and love.
100. When next I came the bold warriors were all awake, with lights burning, and bearing torches: thus was the way to pleasure closed.
101. But at the approach of morn, when again I came, the household all was sleeping; the good damsel's dog alone I found tied to the bed.
102. Many a fair maiden, when rightly known, towards men is fickle: that I experienced, when that discreet maiden I strove to seduce: contumely of every kind that wily girl heaped upon me; nor of that damsel gained I aught.
103. At home let a man be cheerful, and towards a guest liberal; of wise conduct he should be, of good memory and ready speech; if much knowledge he desires, he must often talk on good.
104. Fimbulfambi he is called who' little has to say: such is the nature of the simple.

For example: is 'hyrr' appropriate to use here? Maybe it usually refers to fire in specific way like a camp- or cookingfire instead of a more abstract use of the term which would be appropriate here.

The old Jotun I sought; now I am come back: little got I there by silence; in many words I spoke to my advantage in Suttung's halls.
106. Gunnlod gave me, on her golden seat, a draught [Pg 41]of the precious mead; a bad recompense I afterwards made her, for her whole soul, her fervent love.
107. Rati's mouth I caused to make a space, and to gnaw the rock; over and under me were the Jotun's ways: thus I my head did peril.
108. Of a well-assumed form I made good use: few things fail the wise; for Odhrærir is now come up to men's earthly dwellings.
109. 'Tis to me doubtful that I could have come from the Jotun's courts, had not Gunnlod aided me, that good damsel, over whom I laid my arm.
110. On the day following came the Hrimthursar, to learn something of the High One, in the High One's hall: after Bolverk they inquired, whether he with the gods were come, or Suttung had destroyed him?
111. Odin, I believe, a ring-oath[23] gave. Who in his faith will trust? Suttung defrauded, of his drink bereft, and Gunnlod made to weep!
112. Time 'tis to discourse from the preacher's chair. By the well of Urd I silent sat, I saw and meditated, I listened to men's words.
113. Of runes I heard discourse, and of things divine, nor of graving them were they silent, nor of sage counsels, at the High One's hall. In the High One's hall. I thus heard say:
114. I counsel thee, Loddfafnir, to take advice: thou wilt profit if thou takest it. Rise not at night, unless to explore, or art compelled to go out.[Pg 42]
115. I counsel thee, Loddfafnir, to take advice, thou wilt profit if thou takest it. In an enchantress's embrace thou mayest not sleep, so that in her arms she clasp thee.
116. She will be the cause that thou carest not for Thing or prince's words; food thou wilt shun and human joys; sorrowful wilt thou go to sleep.
117. I counsel thee, etc. Another's wife entice thou never to secret converse.
118. I counsel thee, etc. By fell or firth if thou have to travel, provide thee well with food.
119. I counsel thee, etc. A bad man let thou never know thy misfortunes; for from a bad man thou never wilt obtain a return for thy good will.
120. I saw mortally wound a man a wicked woman's words; a false tongue caused his death, and most unrighteously.
121. I counsel thee, etc. If thou knowest thou hast a friend, whom thou well canst trust, go oft to visit him; for with brushwood over-grown, and with high grass, is the way that no one treads.
122. I counsel thee, etc. A good man attract to thee in pleasant converse; and salutary speech learn while thou livest.
123. I counsel thee, etc. With thy friend be thou never first to quarrel. Care gnaws the heart, if thou to no one canst thy whole mind disclose.
124. I counsel thee, etc. Words thou never shouldst exchange with a witless fool;
125. For from an ill-conditioned man thou wilt never get a return for good; but a good man will bring thee favour by his praise.[Pg 43]
126. There is a mingling of affection, where one can tell another all his mind. Everything is better than being with the deceitful. He is not another's friend who ever says as he says.
127. I counsel thee, etc. Even in three words quarrel not with a worse man: often the better yields, when the worse strikes.
128. I counsel thee, etc. Be not a shoemaker, nor a shaftmaker, unless for thyself it be; for a shoe if ill made, or a shaft if crooked, will call down evil on thee.
129. I counsel thee, etc. Wherever of injury thou knowest, regard that injury as thy own; and give to thy foes no peace.
130. I counsel thee, etc. Rejoiced at evil be thou never; but let good give thee pleasure.
131. I counsel thee, etc. In a battle look not up, (like swine the sons of men then become) that men may not fascinate thee.
132. If thou wilt induce a good woman to pleasant converse, thou must promise fair, and hold to it: no one turns from good if it can be got.
133. I enjoin thee to be wary, but not over wary; at drinking be thou most wary, and with another's wife; and thirdly, that thieves delude thee not.
134. With insult or derision treat thou never a guest or wayfarer. They often little know, who sit within, of what race they are who come.
135. Vices and virtues the sons of mortals bear in their breasts mingled; no one is so good that no failing attends him, nor so bad as to be good for nothing.[Pg 44]
136. At a hoary speaker laugh thou never; often is good that which the aged utter, oft from a shriveled hide discreet words issue; from those whose skin is pendent and decked with scars, and who go tottering among the vile.
137. I counsel thee, etc. Rail not at a guest, nor from thy gate thrust him; treat well the indigent; they will speak well of thee.
138. Strong is the bar that must be raised to admit all. Do thou give a penny, or they will call down on thee every ill in thy limbs.
139. I counsel thee, etc. Wherever thou beer drinkest, invoke to thee the power of earth; for earth is good against drink, fire for distempers, the oak for constipation, a corn-ear for sorcery, a hall for domestic strife. In bitter hates invoke the moon; the biter for bite-injuries is good; but runes against calamity; fluid let earth absorb.",,False,self,t5_2scl4,False,,,True,t3_hxjbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/hxjbr/the_high_ones_lay_part_3_sorry_about_having_to/,

I suggested that she maybe think about a rune circle with that phrase instead, and she loves the idea.

This of course brings to light my limited understanding of transliterating English into Younger Futhark.

The men went out upon a sandy spit of land that jutted out into the sea. 

They cut up a long strip of the grassy turf, being careful to leave the ends still connected to the ground, so that the strip could be lifted up into an arch. The strip was propped up with a spear that was ornamented with runes. The spear was quite tall; a man reaching up could just touch the rivets attaching the spearhead to the shaft. All four men were to pass under and through the lifted sod. 

Each man then opened a vein and let the blood drip together into the hollow of earth under the arch, and then they mixed together the blood and soil. Then they fell together to their knees, and calling to the gods as witnesses, swore to treat each other as brothers and to avenge one another""

Standing strong against the storm

Mighty Thor watches for the giants 

As he spots the giants Thor sounds his great horn

With the sun glinting off the giants tridents

They make an easy target for Thor’s heave

Mjolnir streaks across the field lightning flying all around

Cutting through swathes of giants before they could even breathe

Nothing can stop Thor’s ceaseless pound

The giants swarm all around Thor

Hoping to get the lucky strike

But Thor just swings his hammer and causes it to rain and pour

Crushing blow that smash head, chest and their pikes

Lightning strikes from the sky as Mjolnir begins its toil

And then Odin’s answering call, the horn long and low

Odin charges forth on Sleipnir’s proud back, his hooves over the earth like water and oil

Gungnir pointed down and onward, impales deep as if shot from a bow

Soon there are no more giants threatening Asgaards monumental walls

Odin and Thor take a moment to revel in their glory

The sun sets over the mountains standing ever tall

They reflect over the giants plan and make their way to the mead halls

Thor returns to his home ready to embrace his wife

Sif, gold of hair and goddess of the harvest and fertility

Although Thor might be lord of his fief 

Sif will always remind him of his humility.

I'm working on an artistic project to do with Olaf Tryggvason and was hoping you might be able to point me to a few things. First, I'm wondering if you could help me find images of the exteriors and interiors of 10th-11th century churches in Scandinavia. Apparently stave-churches postdate this; what you find instead are ""palisade churches"" or ""post churches."" Are there any reconstructions I could take a look at, and do they look recognizably Christian (ie, with a tower or transept?)

Secondly, I'm looking for images of the layout of Trondheim (or Nidaros, if you prefer) from this period. Do we know if it would have been walled, like Hedeby? For that matter, was the Viking-age city situated exactly where the modern city is? I ask because I'm curious whether the surrounding geography would have been the same.

A few other points - were there dedicated priests in Norse territories? I don't really recall any popping up in the sagas outside of England and other Christianized areas. It would really help to convey the theme of Scandinavia's Christianization if I could have a fellow in vestments present alongside Olaf. Also, do we know if they would have been present at coronations? I've been reading what articles I could find on kingship and the associated ceremony in the Viking age, and I'm not finding any real information on this point. Charlemagne made a big point of getting the church involved in his civic affairs, as did many other Germanic leaders, but I'm wondering about the Norse particularly. The fact that you have towns like Sigtuna filled to the brim with churches constructed by the kings supports such a link, but I'm not finding anything hard and fast.

Did the Christianized Norse tend to display crucifixes and the like? The only one I've been able to find is the famous example from Birka. Again, including them would help visually demonstrate the presence of Christianity.

1359716433.0,0,self.Norse,17otcy,Are there any similarities from the norse myths to the society today? Reasons/examples to explain the different things in the society. (example in the text),guakelerotk,2,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/17otcy/are_there_any_similarities_from_the_norse_myths/,"The oxford dictionary defines myth like this: 
&gt;a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining a natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events: ancient Celtic myths

Can you easily look at similarities from the norse myths, to for instant norms and values in todays society? 
An example; Skades and Njords marriage is why people want to have cabins both in the mountains and with the sea. 

Skade and Njord are both different; Skade grew up with the high mountains with wolf howls, and Njord with seagulls and the sea. 
Neither of them liked the others environment, and they switched from staying at Njords in the summer and Skades during the winter.
This can be an ""example"" of why people want to go to the ocean when the summer approaches, and when the autumn/winter approaces they want to go to the mountains. 

It can also have a deaper meaning; it shows how hard it is durng a marriage to free ourself from our childhood enviroment. You sometimes have to move away to a strange place/family. 
Some often longs after their 'childhood landscape'; the sounds and smells, and for some it's often hard to find themselves comfortable with the new environment. 

Is there any other similarities we can find within the norse myths/stories? Reasons/examples for why the society is like it is today.
