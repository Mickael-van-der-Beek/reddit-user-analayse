1339600163.0,88,self.LondonSocialClub,uzwfc,"[23/06/12] Global Meetup II @ Monarch, Camden - Midday Onwards",jaymeekae,105,17,510,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/uzwfc/230612_global_meetup_ii_monarch_camden_midday/,"People all over the world will be hosting simultaneous reddit meets! [Global meet up last year was awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FMD2nL3co0), this year should smash it. 

**BASICS:**           
Location: The Monarch, 40-42 Chalk Farm Road, Camden, London, [NW1 8BG](http://goo.gl/maps/B0hS).              
When: Saturday 23rd June, Midday Onwards          
**Contact details** (if you get lost, or if you want to make sure you're in the right place or are standing outside awkwardly then call):

0seven813nine794three9 - somabc / bryan    

**THE EVENT:**          
We have the ENTIRE [Monarch](http://www.monarchbar.com/) booked exclusively from midday to 8pm. And they have even posted us as event [on their website](http://www.monarchbar.com/events/eventdetails/23-jun-12-global-reddit-meetup-day-the-monarch/). (Complete with success kid). At 8pm their club night starts and we can stay until 2am when they close. If it's not raining, we'll probably head up primrose hill at this point.      
    
Show up as soon or as late as you like, I strongly recommend showing up early! The Monarch is a fairly chilled out pub during the day so this event will likely consist of lots of chatting, some larks, drinking, food, etc. Then as the evening goes on, the music will get louder and it's more like a club. 

We're expecting something like ~~150-250 people~~ ~~200+ people~~ 250+ people **Everyone is welcome, I cannot stress this enough.**   

**EXCITING:**         
We have another reddit admin attending this year and he's kindly sorted us out with a bit of budget!! We will likely be putting the money behind the bar... another reason to show up early :D
    
**Please post here if you intend to attend** so I can add you to the list of awesome people and we can give the bar an idea of how many to expect: 
(if you dont get your name on this list, dont worry, you can still attend, there's not a guestlist at the door or anything)

Thanks to everyone that posed! Sorry to the people I missed, I know there were a lot of you! Last year we got 200 people photographed and I'm fairly confident I only missed about 10-15 people TOPS. This year I photographed way more than that and I'm sure I missed heaps. I am confident we had over 300 people in the Monarch on Saturday. Great day everyone. Thanks to insertrandomname for organising, thanks to people that helped with photos and other stuff, and thanks to everyone else for all the thanks, and the stories :)

1342777576.0,57,self.LondonSocialClub,wv7qm,Thank you and goodbye. ,Stux,60,3,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/wv7qm/thank_you_and_goodbye/,"So about a year and a half ago I moved London after spending 4 years in America. I was filing for a divorce from my wife of 3 years. 

Things were bad. I was miserable, lost, my whole world had fallen apart. I had to move in with my parents, all my old friends had moved on or just seemed uninterested in rekindling relations with me. I spent all day in my room just reading Reddit. Somehow I stumbled onto this place, LSC. ""probably just a bunch of boring socially troubled people"" I thought but who was I to pass that judgement so I figured I'd check out one of the meet ups. Curry Night, some douche called Die_Troller was organizing it. Although I didnt really connect with anyone that night it was fun so I decided to check out the penthouse party the following week. It was a blast, these guys are not boring, they're just like me! 

The big moment was when I organized a drink in celebration of my divorce, I was expecting a turn out of 5-10 people. So many people showed we ran out of space in the worlds end! 

Let me get to the point here... Im in America, I went with the intention of a 2 week visit to my girlfriend. I've ended up getting married and have made the decision to stay and start my life with her here. I have files for a status change and hopefully will be given residency. 

I'm posting this to say thank you to all of you who have been in my life for this past year and a bit. You've all helped me along through tough times and also given me some of the best memories I will ever have. Be it from our weekend in Prague drinking shots of hard liquor in a strip club, spending weekends away from home, ending up at casinos with no money and a head ache to Ian blowing his hand off, Lawerence trying to give a rose to strangers in Soho or taking bets on how long Chris will stay awake for...

And for all you noobies, keep this place cool and take care of each other. This place is fucking awesome.

If everything goes to plan I won't be back for a couple of years. 

*raises glass* here's to LSC meet up in FL ;)

I love and miss you all

So I got bored and made a mobile friendly site for LSC events.

You can check it out here: http://lsc.eu01.aws.af.cm/

It sorts events by date so you can quickly find events that are coming up and has a little calendar up top so you can see at a glance if there are events on a date. Clicking on a date also takes you directly to the events on that day.

Clicking on the title will show you the event details, clicking on the Who's In button will give you a list of people that has responded ""IN"" to the event and clicking on the reddit face will take you to the thread for that event.

It's pretty simple (and ugly) right now but is pretty usable so I figured someone might find it useful. Give it a try and post any feedback, i'll be adding a few more things soon.


Also if there are any developers / designers who want to lend a hand at making this more useful and less ugly then either send me a message or check out the project on github: https://github.com/dnharjani/LSC",,False,,t5_2s87x,1374866536.0,,,True,t3_1iylch,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/1iylch/lsc_i_made_you_something/,

I had a blast and you guys really brought me back up from my slump/being stuck in london for the week. Had a great time with the pre-pub crawl breakfast club and thank you guys for really being my jumping off point. 

I enjoyed how everyone when they met me shouted ""OH, THAT'S YOU?!?!"" then offered me drinks, hugs, kisses, and drugs. ( I don't think the drugs guy was actually apart of the crawl) Some offered to wingman for me but I was to far gone to really be effective with my talking skills. But the effort is greatly appreciated most of my friends wingman skills are just giving me thumbs up from across the room. However, my friends don't have the interesting British, Irish, Scottish, French/Russian, Australian or Canadian/Australian accents. 

You guys did your mission and you did a spectacular job. So well in fact that I ended up going back and forth between 2 underground station for about 30 minutes thinking I was actually taking different lines. 

Whenever, I'm back in London or are in the D.C. area I owe you all a drink/back massage.

Sadly this will be PlussOne's final crawl after brightening up LSC for over two years. She is helping me organize this as well so we'll be there from earlier on!

A few things to consider:

* It looks like Northern Line is down that day so check alternative routes and replacement buses. Mid afternoon/late pubs are near Overground stations. 

* A lot of these pubs have a free drink offer when you sign up to their mailing list and print out a voucher!

* Everyone is welcome! Old, new, regulars, first timers etc. Feel free to contact numbers provided if you can't find us.

We have had single friends, students, expats, and similar who, for whatever reason, don't have anyone family or similar to spend the day with. As we have gotten a bit older, our friends have gone home, or developed families and traditions of their own, but we, being (genetically) eastern european, do all our celebrating on Christmas Eve, and still have the day itself free.

So! If anyone in the environs of London wants to come into the centre for a nice christmas dinner and some company, we would be thrilled to have you.

We are both late 20s, professional, geeky. We like reading, trashy crime drama, board, card, and video gaming, and general intellectual-ish conversation, so something not too dissimilar to that would be ideal. I am, at least in theory, a Historian, and my wife is a Lawyer.

We don't much care who you are or where you are from, age/race/sexuality/etc, but we would be more than happy to host you and your partner, if applicable, for christmas dinner, and maybe a boardgame or two (if you're into it).

So! If you or anyone you know could benefit from this, please let me know.

Is there anything holding you back from coming to an event?

Is there anything holding you back from organising an event?

Has anyone had a bad experience at an event? (feel free to use a throwaway account or msg mods if you want) 

What sort of events would you like to see more of?


Flair. Should it be as it is, mod chosen. Should it be open for all. Turned off. Or from templates (aka badges for attending/organising events). Does your Flair/lack of Flair annoy you?

Any other questions we should be asking?

**EDIT: Points raised so far**

Too many drinking events, this is not a surprise as we have noticed we get far more new people at the non-drinking events(and we drink a lot). 

Not enough cultural events

Too many in jokes, people feeling they are outside the loop

some people being creepy

**WHERE:** [The Blue Posts](http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-699.php), 28 Rupert Street W1D 6DJ

**WHY:** This is the pub crawl with NO crawl at all. I've booked us the private room upstairs which will accommodate up to 40 people. No fee (YAY), private bar with barkeep. They only do 'bar snacks' if you're hungry.

Does anyone want to DJ? If yes, I'll call back and ask about a PA system. Because it's the weekend before Valentine's Day, sexy tunes only. Ha! Just kidding. If lots want to DJ, you can fight amongst yourselves.

The bummer is the place closes at midnight. The good thing - it's in SoHo so going out again afterwards is NOT a problem if you're on a roll. Within a stone's throw from Piccadilly and Leicester Square underground stops.

I planned this way ahead so those from outside the area can make plans to get into the area. Start booking those train tickets, boys and girls!

**Lost? Call or text die_troller at 07769977790 since I can't make the Reddit meeting I organized. Boo hoo. Instead I'll be in Palm Springs, California enjoying 27C weather and mai tais by the pool while I think about all the fun you're having without me.**

**What is GrMD?**        
reddit encourages simultaneous meetups all across the globe. This year's is **June 15th**. Since it's heavily publicised on reddit and it's a ""one off"" thing, we tend to get way more people than usual. Around 210 in 2011 and over 300 in 2012. I know... [I counted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuHpvnoNV0)

**We need a venue**         
Any ideas? Previously we've used the Monarch which has been great to us but I think it might be a bit small now plus we will have the same issue of losing the exclusive use of the booked area from 9pm
      
**Our requirements are:**          
- No hire charge (although a minimum spend should be fine)       
- Room for about 350+ people        
- Room/sound set up for a band (eek)      
- Able to accommodate us from about midday til late              
- Ideally some outdoor space       
             
**This sounds amazing, let's have it on a rocket to the moon!**        
Last year in this thread, people had some amazing ideas about hiring a blimp or some shit like that. Stuff like this is really awesome and exciting and I don't want to crush your blimp dreams but remember that anything super expensive would require us to sell tickets, which is sort of against the ethos of GrMD and also gets us into a whole mess of issues of sorting out cash and getting insurance and lots of non-fun things. Lets keep ideas awesome but cheap/free and achievable.

**Confirmation:** Venue will be Old Nick in Holbourn. 5pm - 11pm. http://oldnickholborn.co.uk/

They remember us (in a good way) from last year. We've got exclusive use of the pub. Normal pub prices.

Stay tuned will sort out late night venue. Or suggestions more than welcome. 

And again, this was my first event, I'm still coming out, so if it's your first time out or your 1000th, come on down. (After browsing through PortConflict's album, I've realised that was the night I met a whole bunch of people I hang out with every week for the first time). I'll post more details closer to the time.

So get costuming!

1317969770.0,29,self.LondonSocialClub,l3wiy,[10/10/11] Pub quiz against Metafilter,Lowercase_Drawer,29,0,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/l3wiy/101011_pub_quiz_against_metafilter/,"I happened across a meetup of that *other* popular discussion and commentary site, [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com). Happening in CLERKENWELL on Monday. Anyway guess what, it's at a pub quiz! Now I propose this: **that reddit go along and hand their asses to them**. That's right, it'll be like the boat race of geeky websites.

**Details:** It's TONIGHT at the Hat and Tun, Clerkenwell. Nearest tubes: Farringdon or Chancery Lane. Quiz starts at 7.30 and runs for an hour and a half or so, and there's a £2 stake per player.

So who's in? Quizzing big-guns and newbies alike. If you aren't in, only the *very best* of excuses will do.

**UPDATE: This is it, my friends. Today is the day we do battle; today is the day we show the crumbling waxworks of Metafilter that it is *we* who are the life-blood of the internet, *we* who have come to London, individually, anonymously, but who have built up a tribe of dedicated partying awesomers. All human life is here, and a true, dedicated student of life must incidentally acquire a fine grasp of the *orbis trivialis*. Let's roll.**

Now for some logistics. IF YOU CAN, be at [The Betsey Trotwood](http://g.co/maps/ytmrz) in advance, for a strategy meeting. I'll be there from about 6.30. Any problems, call me on 07747 3Z7749 (before 7.30... after that time all phones will be off). From there we go en masse to the Hat and Tun. Bring your A-Game.

We have a huge area booked in the Monarch, including the garden. For all the new people... welcome! Everyone is new once and we are very friendly. Groups of people will be arriving from 1pm onwards so you will not be standing in a bar alone at 4pm. The area is booked under the name ""reddit"". 
         
insertrandomname is doing a stellar effort of keeping the list updated in the original thread but don't worry if you dont get your name on there, you are still welcome to come.        
        
**Date:** 25th June 2011      
**Time:** 4pm (early or late is fine but this is when we have our area booked from)         
**Location:** [The Monarch](http://www.monarchbar.com/) Camden, 40-42 Chalk Farm Road, Greater London NW1 8BG             
**Getting there**:  Closest tube is Chalk Farm which is on the Northern Line (Edgware branch, not High Barnet). Walk down Chalk Farm road heading towards Camden... or you can get off at Camden and walk north instead. The northern line should be up and running this weekend.

This will all change on a whim. None of these venues have been confirmed yet, this is us tossing up ideas, we haven't confirmed with venues.

Ideas of better venues in area that can hold 70+ ppl will be nice :)

Notting Hill/Bayswater pub crawl:

Lunch time 12-3 : The Churchill Arms

http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=4&amp;itemid=60&amp;task=View

Best Thai and Guiness in Town

3-5 : Sun in Splendour

http://www.suninsplendourpub.co.uk/

Great beer garden, average pub otherwise. Pitstop.

5-7 : Kings Head

http://www.taylor-walker.co.uk/pub-food/kings-head-bayswater/pid-C1196

My old local. Cheap booze &amp; food.

7-10 : Westbourne House

http://www.westbournehouse.net/

Good cocktails. Slightly posh. Will bring it down to our level :)

10-1 : Notting Hill Arts Club

http://www.nottinghillartsclub.com/

Dance the frigging night away.

Any other late night venues/better pub venues in the area? Harlem is shut.

Crazy Homies (downstairs with the stripper pole and cocktails) would be great, but ain't big enough. Same with The Cow.

Again, we haven't checked if these venues are happy to have us, the idea of the pub crawl came up 3 hours ago, so work in progress. We could decide to go to East London in the end :)

The entirety of the pub will be hired exclusively for Reddit on Saturday the 29th of October 2011 from 17:00.  The venue can hold 200+ so bring your IRL's, **the invitation is open to all**. 

I am looking for a few volunteers to conjure up some decent choons as we will have access to their PA system.  

So, get creative and start brainstorming, Halloween is only two weeks away! While costumes are not mandatory, they are highly encouraged.

**Edit I will ask for a very nominal donation towards the cost of goodies.. £.50p to be exact**

**Edit** Because the pub is not normally open on weekends, the kitchen will be shut for the evening.

**SUPER MEGA EDIT : Numbers are well over 100 now,  anyone interested in helping to decorate the pub just before the party?**

Venues and times decided!  See below***

It's my birthday (Friday 13th, yes how apt), so please come help me ~~forget~~ celebrate with an awesome party.

First up from 7 onwards (I'll be there a bit earlier if you want to show up earlier), we will hit an amazing cocktail bar for crazy, inventive drinks -  **[Lab](http://www.labbaruk.com/), 12 Old Compton Street, W1D 4TQ**.  Area booked under my name.  You can check out the menu [here](http://www.labbaruk.com/pdf/cocktail-list.pdf#view=fit), but aside from that very extensive list, you are encouraged to be **inventive**!  Bring the bartender something you want your cocktail to taste like, or tell him ""I want it to taste like sunshine"" or strawberry and vanilla icecream or whatever.  They get experimental and have some excellent bartenders so get crazy!

At about 9ish we'll move onwards, relocating to **[The Shakespeare's Head](http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/shakespeares-head), 64-68 Kingsway, Holborn, WC2B 6BG** (again area booked under my name) for something a bit more conventional (and cheaper!), that is open til 1am!  So bring out the jaeger trains and catch me up! :)

Sometime between getting bored and getting kicked out, we will move onto a club TBD, but possibly including the DNB night already listed on LSC.

Everyone welcome, my number's O7five9Ofive33843!

I realized I don't drink enough in central London to actually know where good places for pubcrawls are. 

Anywhere that says **TBD** still needs suggestions from you for a place. I'd like to finalize this by Monday, since I've left it far too long already.

I've kept to the 2 hour at each bar timeframe, it's long enough for everyone to get there and get a drink or two, I always found 1 hour a bit of a rush - especially with the smaller places.

Since I don't want my legacy to fade away, it's time to up the game. Activities, food, drinking and clubbing are the order of the day so I present to you...

**Pub Crawl VIII - Everything to Everybody** 

*(Caution: This pub crawl will last 24 hours!!!)*

Full details tbc but I need numbers for the activity, food and pre club bar.

Off the top of my head:  
**10am - 12pm:- Meet up and breakfast  
12pm - 2pm:- Bowling at All Star Lanes Holborn  
2pm - 7pm:- Pub crawl round cheap pubs (pubs tbc)  
7pm - 11pm:- Pre club drinks at a cocktail bar  
11pm - 3am:- Clubbing @ venue tbc (Suggestions welcome. Cheapskates?)  
3am - 5/6am:- Food at Balans (I'll confirm alcohol is served until 6am, unless somebody knows)  
5/6am - 10am:- Empire Casino**  

Critique, suggestions, thoughts, feelings?

*Potential dates for May are: ~~7th, 14th, 21st,~~ 28th.*

There'll be a few surprises on the way as well :) And if anybody makes it from 10am - 10am they'll get an official ""I survived the r/londonsocialclub 24hr pub crawl"" t-shirt :D

Now, what I need is numbers for bowling and numbers for pre club drinks. It'd also be handy knowing how many wanted to club it up or do the rest as if we don't get us all in somewhere that'd be shit.

Can I get provisional answers in the form of
Positive Expletive: Preferred Date, If Breakfast, If Bowling, If Drinking, If Cocktails, If Club, If planning to be in a fit state to continue, If Casino

though just really need date, if bowling and if cocktails.

e.g.  
FUCK YEAH!: 14th, brekky, bowling, drinks, cocktails, club  
or  
RIGHT TOOTIN'!: 7th, drinks, cocktails

Once I have numbers I'll sort it out and put up an official agenda and confirm attendance the Monday before hand.

**UPDATE** The 28th is the most popular date, thus so it shall be.

Right, we're pretty much sorted and what isn't sorted we can wing. I very much doubt I'll be able to move 50 people with ease so there's some flexibility in what people want to do.

Saturday May 28th  
10:00 - 10:15  
Meet a Holborn Underground Station (Central Line).  
Anybody turning up after this time is not eligible for a t-shirt! No exceptions!  

10:15 - 11:45  
Breakfast.  
If there's a lot of us we'll have to head to Shakespeare's Head Wetherspoons for brekkie. If just a few then there's a couple of eateries and patisseries on the way which look quite nice.  
An update will be posted on r/lsc once we see how many turn up.

12:00 - 15:30  
Bowling &amp; Karaoke!  
Meeting at All Star Lanes in Holborn (Victoria House, Bloomsbury Pl., WC1B 4DA).  
Please turn up for this on time as money cash has to be paid up front before we're allowed to bowl.  
There are still a few slots available for those just turning up so if you want to bowl but don't have your name down please still come along.  
[Karaoke track list](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?hl=en_US&amp;hl=en_US&amp;key=0Ak76fUykHbxbdDZXcXZJSVFUX3J5Ui12c2szMHNCaGc&amp;output=html) 
Also, if your name is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/h33tm/pub_crawl_viii_living_on_a_spare_bowling_update/) and you don't turn up and nobody else steps in to play, I will be chasing you for money.

15:45 - 17:00  
The Princess Louise (208 High Holborn, WC1V 7EP)  
Reddit favourite and cheap booze we'll start here.

17:10 - 18:45  
The Shakespeare's Head (64-68 Kingsway, WC2B 6AG)  
Again, reasonably cheap as it's a Wetherspoons. Critdragon's in charge of blagging us free drinks :D

19:00 - up to 02:00  
Adventure Bar (20 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, WC2E 9HP)  
Cocktail bar in the middle of Covent Garden. You'll want to be on time for this ;)

19:30 - 22:00  
Walkabout (11 Henrietta Street, WC2E 8PY)  
Champions League Final for those who are interested.

23:00 - up to 02:00  
Club???  
Does anybody want me to book a club?  
Option include:  
http://www.verve-bar.co.uk/saturdays_at_verve-4040-40466-event.html
http://www.tamarai.co.uk/diamond-noir-saturday.html  
http://www.traffic.uk.com/index.php?id=73  
The problem is that it's reasonably expensive to book a table in these places and unless people are willing to give me money cash upfront I'm not putting my card down for it.  

Alternatively we could rock up to - http://www.roadhouse.co.uk/whats-coming-up.php - later on any try to get in.

02:30 - 12:00  
Taxi to King's Cross [EGG](http://www.egglondon.net/) (200 York Way, Kings Cross, N7 9AP)  
If you're separated from the group at any point (different pubs etc) the meet up place is here.  
If you're planning on going I'd recommend getting a [VIP ticket](http://www.clubtickets.com/gb/2011-05/28/muak), it gets you 3 free drinks and access to the nice area :D  
EGG also seems to be open until 11am/midday on the 28th.

07:00 - 10:00 (This is a maybe, we may stay at the club)  
Taxi back to Leicester Square, Empire Casino (5-6 Leicester Square, WC2H 7NA)

NB:  
Weather looks okay for late at night.  
Guys, please wear shirts, shoes and decent jeans or trousers, it will help with getting into places.  
Ladies, please wear boobs, it will help with getting into places.  
We are not United States Army Rangers, if you do not get into somewhere we will leave you behind. It is your own responsibility for being presentable enough to get into places; this means both attire and sobriety level.

The group is set to secret so if you wanna join, please email lscfacebooksignups@gmail.com with a link to your facebook profile and the email address you use for facebook. Obviously we're doing this manually so give us time to add you but if its been over 24 hours and we've missed you then message the mods on this subreddit.      

**PLEASE NOTE:**       
  
* **The facebook group is not your wall, please keep posts relevant to LSC and meetups**    
* **You can add others to the group but they MUST have attended an LSC event**   
* Unless your event is posted same day/last minute, there is no need to cross post events from reddit to facebook, just post your event on reddit

* If you have photos to share: post photos in an album outside of the group, then click ""Want to share your album? You can give friends or relatives this link:"" and share the album inside the group.

Alright everyone,

Save the date, February 25th. The pub crawl will be in Shoreditch, details are still pending but rest assured that we will plan the shit out of it and it will be good bars, homemade baked goods, and really just lovely.

Shoreditch is easily accessible by a number of transport links and we know our way around the bars there, so basically just posting this before anything else gets planned

The next pub crawl has already been dated at Saturday the 15th of January, this is an open invitation to any and all redditors to get completely smashed with others and have a good laugh. Our pub crawls are now growing in numbers and myself and die_troller are arranging this one, which shall be covering the Whitehall and then heading to a golden triangle of pubs.

**For anybody who needs more details or may get lost, talk to die_troller at 07769977790**

**Proposed Route**

**1pm** - The Old Shades, Whitehall, SW1A 2BX - traditional little pub and most of these shall be
 
**2pm** - The Lord Moon of the Mall, SW1A 2DY - this as people may remember is a little spoons we always end up heading to even when it's not on the list

**3pm** - The Two Chairmen, SW1Y 5AT - an old traditional little pub that should be quite nice

**4pm** - Sports Cafe, NW1 7BY - a big old sports cafe, with a January sale on, and here are [vouchers](http://www.thesportscafe.com/london/offerslondon/)

**5pm** - The Three Crowns, SW1Y 6HD - nice little pub, have to go here or walk for several years, cheap drinks, friendly place

**6pm** - The Glassblower, W1B 5JY - now we hit the golden triangle of pubs, this being the first, a pub on each corner, all of them good and cheap

**7pm** - The Leicester Arms, W1B 5DP - the second of the golden triangle, here again friendly place and decent priced drinks

**8pm** - The Warwick, W1B 5LR - the best of the triangle, here we have a great pub, stunning to look at and a friendly place

**9pm** - Be At One, W1D 7LA - you may then crawl through Soho on your way to be at one where you can grab some cocktails

**10pm** - O'Neills, W1D 6PU - the old favourite, then we shall either stay here or we shall move on as we are surrounded by pubs and bars

Halloween party is coming up.  This is one of our bigger, more crazy events of the year.  Almost everyone dresses up.  Even myself and my number one enemy beavershaw are dressing up - and we never dress up (We're even in opposing costumes!).  But costumes are not mandatory.  Just cool.

http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/y38hy/031112_halloween_party/

We are kicking off from the Old Nick Pub in Holbourn. 20-22 Sandland Street, London, WC1R 4PZ

5pm - 11pm. http://oldnickholborn.co.uk/

We have the entire pub booked out just for us.  So finding us is easy.

~~Late night venue will be confirmed shortly.~~

Late night venue is Temple Walkabout, Temple Station, Temple Place, London WC2R 2PH.
£5 cover.  11:15pm - 3am.  (Sorry only place that didn't care if we show up in costume).  We're on the guestlist under my name ""Brad Jayakody"".  My mobile is 07760389766 if you don't have it/need it.

Dan is providing his sound system for kicking halloween tunes (including karaoke mikes if the night takes us that way).  

Rosa has sorted out the playlist and is decorating the pub in a spooky manner.

There was be 3 trophies for best costumes, 1, 2, 3 as voted by the people (picture forthcoming).

There will also be a bit of gambling occurring.  £1 buy-in.  You get 2 votes.  At what time we clear the minimum spend of £500.  And how much we spend total in the pub by the end of the night.  Last year spend was £1700 I think.  Closest to each without going over wins 50% of pot.

And a Spooky Cake competition.  Bring cake.  We eat cake.  We vote on best cake.  Winner gets a kick arse trophy. http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/11wkzx/031112_spooky_cake_contest_the_halloween_party/

Here's some pics courtesy of PortConflict from last years shindig.

If you're a nervous newbie, this was my first big event.  I'm still coming out.  I'm even a bloody mod here now.  Again after browsing PortConflict's album, I realised that was the first night I met a bunch of people that I now count as good friends and hang out with almost daily.  So if it is your first or 1000th event, come on down.

All are welcome.  No limit to numbers in the slightest.

* Rosa 07 eight zero 4 9247 three ate
* Richie 07 five for five 841 zero 6 0

That seems like a sweet idea to me so... does anyone have any ideas?     
I know a few people have already been planning a blood drive but I think they're planning to do that some time sooner so, anything else? Maybe this is something where we can split down into smaller groups and do different things? If you know of a charity or other good cause that needs some people power, let us know...     
     
The way I see it, there's two main options here!       
1. Fundraising - Raise cash through whatever means and donate to charity

http://christmas.crisis.org.uk

If you're in town over Christmas and have some free time, it's one of the most rewarding things you can do.  It is work though, but a big mix of duties.  Check out the crisis site above for a better description than my muddled brain can explain.

I've done it for the past few years.

I'm a key/senior volunteer down at Deptford (which is moving to Lewisham this year, so it is going to be slightly weird, much bigger venue) and I'll be doing the arvo shifts of the 23rd, 24th, 27th, 28th &amp; 29th.

Feel free to join me there or at another location closer to you.  The requirement is for a minimum of 2 shifts.  You can do as many as you like.  And bloody show up to any shifts that you sign up for please.

If you haven't done it before, there is an induction day.

There's a great after party as well.  Normally at cable.  Last year the rockaoke guys were there.  The fact that it clashes with mine, mpostle's and bubblegumgills birthday party is a downside, but I'll forgive you.

Any other questions, fire away.  As I said there are also other LSCers who have done it.

There was some chatter in weeks past about setting up [a curry night](http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/fqyaz/dear_sirs_recommend_a_great_curry_place_in_london/c1hzhkv). Well... challenge accepted!

There's this great new-ish place on Finchley road called [Guglee](http://www.guglee.co.uk/). Food is pretty good - not Tayyabs good, but still better than the vast majority of Brick Lane. I'm friends with the guys who own and run the place, good blokes. So I had a word with them, saying that I'd like to get some friends in there, and could they sort me out with a set menu. They've come back with [this](http://i.imgur.com/87L9D.png). This is a one-time reddit-only offer, they're not doing it for anyone else, and IMHO it's good value - £17.50, and the food is good. The only thing is, they require at least a minimum of 15 people to be there. So... who's ready to do this? ~~and when is a good date? According to the calendar, the 18th of March is [Dodgeball](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/fmkxx/official_dodgeball_thread/) and the 19th is the [Milky-bar meetup](http://www.reddit.com/r/UKMeetUp2011/comments/f6sd4/the_milky_bars_are_on_me_19th_march_london/). So that's that weekend out... Are people feeling like doing it this weekend, i,e, either the 11th, 12th or 13th? or the weekend of 25th/ 26th/ 27th? Or should we do it mid-week? Open to all suggestions.~~

---------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT** - Date has been nailed down - Sunday the 13th of March. 7.30 PM. It's the earliest that works for most peeps. [Location map HERE](http://www.guglee.co.uk/visit-us.php). If you do confirm, please definitely show up, as (a) the food is awesome, (b) these guys will be setting space aside for us, and will lose business if there are no-shows, and (c) you get to hang out with teh awesome peoplez from INTERNETS!! my telephone number is 077---6--99------777---90. Call me if any issues. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Also - before i forget - for those of you that watch Soccer AM, this restaurant was the one featured in the ['kammy do it?' curry challenge.](http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid37931888001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAAAnV5Z0~,xyoxShbYDLGF9soaiFPgW3zLlz9XVcca&amp;bctid=795589122001). But trust me, the food is not usually prepared to make big men hot and sweaty. Though it can be arranged, if that's your thing...

It is time for another famous LSC Pub Crawl and this time we are headed West for Valentine's weekend! You may be thinking to yourself ""But there's nothing out there...only wet blankets."" Have heart, my friends, there's giggle water aplenty. Just think! A morning strolling along the Thames, gams soaking up the London sunshine. An afternoon getting ossified with your favorite ale, evening at an underground juice joint, then appreciating a chassis or two at a ritzy burlesque! 

This caper is the cat's meow, just you believe me! So, all you bearcats, janes, molls, fly boys, sheiks, and bell bottom boys! Get your rouge ready or spit shine your swankest spats, this crawl is going to be the bee's knees.

**[Map!](http://goo.gl/maps/ZLq68)**

****
**12:00-1:30** [The Blue Anchor](http://www.blueanchorlondon.com/) W6 9DJ  This is a lovely Thames-side pub. We have a table reserved inside and one reserved outside. They are one of those old pubs with all sorts of history, and reportedly fantastic food. 

****
**2:00-3:30** [The Hop Poles](http://www.hoppoleshammersmith.co.uk/Venue.aspx) W6 9HR  The Hop Poles is ready for us! A bit of a trendier pub with lots of cozy couches, and some tasty bites if you're peckish. Casque Mark certified ales and whatnot. 

****
**4:00-5:30** [The Queen's Head](http://queensheadhammersmith.co.uk/) W6 7BL  Right on Brook Green, this pub has a large outdoor seating area. Unfortunately their kitchen is bust this weekend so only snacks available. 

****
**6:00-7:30** [Smith's](http://smithsw6.co.uk/) W6 7PD  Located beneath The Brook Green Hotel, this cozy little number is sure to be jumping. Classic and new-school cocktails are served with aplomb.

****
**8:00-9:30** [The Melrose](http://melroseshepherdsbush.co.uk/) W12 8QQ The Melrose is a trendy spot with two for £8 cocktails until 9:00. Be prepared to throw some shapes on the dance floor, or enjoy the candlelit foozeball table.

****
**9:35-3:00** [Ginglik](http://www.ginglik.co.uk/) W12 8PH   10:45 is burlesque followed by DJs til 3 am.  This venue does have a cover but you **can [purchase ahead of time for £6](http://www.wegottickets.com/event/201459) or £7 at the door.**  Your **reddit username** is on the list at the door.

Lots to do, and drinking is optional.

&gt; **Zombies**: the word alone is enough to get the pulse racing, but what makes them so terrifying? On a dark winter’s night at the Science Museum, we’ll explore the murky but fascinating world of consciousness and uncover the inner workings of the zombie psyche. From mind-altering drugs to the innate impulses we all feel, prepare to walk the line between human and zombie in surprising and theatrical ways. Bring your brain – and guard it carefully.

&gt; There’ll also be prizes for the best-dressed zombies, so get creating your costumes!

It's free to get in and free to do everything with the exception of the following:

* Speed dating (£10) - If you want to do this get there early because there are only 30 spots for each gender.
* Pub Quiz (£2) - General quiz with a few parts relevant to the topic of the night (zombies).

http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/press_and_media/press_releases/2012/10/Lates.aspx

Quick overview of what goes on at these things:

* Childrenless hands-on science experiments
* Access to most exhibits
* Silent Disco
* Speed dating (check my flair :*()
* A pub quiz that we apparently won once
* Cash bar with nibbles, drinks and terrible wine

My phone number if someone needs to contact me before the event: 0seven78511zero44eight (Mathew).

We meet for drinks (or not drinks!) in the Hoop and Toy at 6pm, then walk to the museum as a group around 6:45pm. http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/37/3741/Hoop_and_Toy/South_Kensington

We survived the Olympics, watched Britain crumble and discovered that all famous people are paedophiles. Oh and the world didn't end. 

So we are going to party like they do Spain (where they go all night), by dressing up as hobos, preparing flasks of mulled wine and going to the top of Parliament Hill so as to watch the fireworks over London. I am imagining that we will have a good old sing song, a jig, and some cheerful banter. 

If someone has a portable speaker, that will be fun to dance to.

**Important Info** 

* Bring festive drinks. Bring drink. Seriously, handout a beer, make a new friend.

* Dress for the cold (the more important of the two dressing suggestions)

* Dress shabbily.

The President pardons a turkey from some unspoken crime and lets the bird roam free in the countryside. We celebrate this by feasting on turkey, mushrooms, sweet potatoes and other autumn foods. So while my family stuffs their faces with delicious coma-inducing food ([apparently just a rumor, but I know what I've been through](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan#Turkey_meat_and_drowsiness)), I'm going to induce my own coma with alcohol in the company of LSC.

There were comments about the Rattlesnake, and initially I had planned to slash it from the list but the people there have been very accommodating in terms of helping me book a reasonable amount of seats so it is going to stand.

**HEADS UP! IF YOU ARE COMING LATE, GET TO THE ANAM BAR BEFORE 21:30 (9:30 PM) BECAUSE IT WILL BE FREE FOR US BEFORE THEN! SAY ""REDDIT"" AT THE DOOR AND YOU'LL BE IN!** The Anam Bar will be able to seat a good amount of us. They messed up my booking and ended up giving the comfy red chairs to someone else after I had ordered them. To accommodate they are rearranging the bar to have some tables by the front, gave me my deposit for half of the original price and have informed me that the comfy red chairs are essentially ours to use as well because the party that has booked them isn't nearly large enough to use them all and isn't nearly as large as ours is.

Hope to see you guys there!

Troller's is 077 sixty nein 9 triple 7 90.

Just looks for the brown guys in suits.  Or the girls in wedding dresses :D


Surprisingly this is not mine, but our own /u/furtivebee got divorced a few weeks ago and as she still fits into her wedding dress, fuck it, let's suit and wedding dress up and go on an unromantic crawl of London.

So for those of you not jetting off to somewhere warm this Easter, we shall be drinking in the most unromantic locations London has to offer.  Suggestions welcome.

Currently the ideas are:

* Hunterian Museum (esp for the severed syphilitic penises in jars)
* Jack the Ripper Murder sites
* GUM clinic
* Beckton Sewage Treatment Works
* Rotherhithe tunnel.  The most polluted tunnel in London.  ""Nothing says romance is dead like a lungful of carbon monoxide."" - Fin.

Itinerary (TBD/Confirmed):

Unlike normal crawls, this one shall flow a little more.  Breakfast, Intrepid Fox, Covent Garden Cocktail Club &amp; Bethnal Green Working Men's Club are 100% stops.  The rest we may or may not be there and will hang around until we get bored or find something shiny.  We'll be in the area.  Ping me a message.  Or if you have attended an event, the LSC Facebook page will prob have a running commentary.

* 11-12pm  Breakfast.  At a spoons. http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-metropolitan-bar
7 Station Approach, Marylebone Road, Marylebone, Greater London, NW1 5LA

* 12-1pm Westminster Register Office aka The Old Marylebone Town Hall
http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/communityandliving/registrar/
97-113 Marylebone Road, London, NW1 5PT
Grab a drink on the way from the offie. Drink as we walk down the street.  Bonus points for proposing to strangers.

* 1-1:30pm.  McDonalds.  Or Chicken Cottage.  Whichever we run into first.

* 1:30-2pm 
GUM clinic
http://www.chelwest.nhs.uk/services/hiv-sexual-health/clinics/56-dean-street/56-dean-street
56 Dean Street, Soho, London, W1D 6AQ
As we are visiting, slightly inebriated, a donation of £3 by texting DEANST to 70300 is encouraged. 
Bonus points to anyone who gets an STD test done.  HIV results are obtained in 5 minutes...  But you are encouraged to make an appointment.  For the rest, we may just grab a group picture outside.

* 2-3 pm Trafalgar Square.  Bonus points for photobombing tourist pics in a wedding dress.  And for finding marriage proposals.

* 3 - 4:30 pm Intrepid Fox.  Wedding dress pictures in a Metal Bar, can we get any more 90's music video than this? 15 St. Giles High Street, London, WC2H 8LQ

* 4:30 - 7 pm Covent Garden Cocktail Club.  2-4-1 Cocktails.  
http://www.coventgardencocktailclub.co.uk/
The Covent Garden Cocktail Club, 6-7 Great Newport Street, LONDON, WC2H 7JB 
Please register to be a member early, as you are required to be a member to enter (or be accompanied by one)
http://www.coventgardencocktailclub.co.uk/?section=contact

* 7-8pm.  Meat Market for dinner.  Again 'cos it's awesome.  And meat is tasty, tasty murder.

* 8-9pm.  Brewdog Shoreditch.  Just 'cos it's awesome.  And on the way to Bethnal Green.
51-55 Bethnal Green Road, London, E1 6LA
http://www.brewdog.com/bars/shoreditch

* 9-? We shall end at Bethnal Green Working Men's Club for the Slow Dance Party.  Wedding attire.  Working Men's Club.  Slow music.  Fucking Awesome.  £5 advance.  £7 on door. http://www.workersplaytime.net/NEXTWEEK.htm
Tickets here - http://www.tickettailor.com/checkout/view-event/id/7810/chk/9c14


Sunday.  Still alive?  Still pulling off the suit or dress?
* 9 - 3am Wedding Crashers Bank Holiday Bowling.
https://www.facebook.com/events/539590749409035/

Mixed into these will be some pubs, some cocktails, some dodgy dancing.  And lots of outdoor street drinking.  And freaking out tube goers.

**Dress Code**:  Wedding Attire

furtivebee will be in her wedding dress.

I'll be tuxedo'd up.

But if you ain't suited up, come along anyway.  How often do you get to drink in the streets of London with someone in a bridal gown?  

As Mancalime said, ""2013 shall be the year of unusual drinking!"".

Well, sweet child of mine, it's ironic you should ask. Let me tell you about this crazy little thing called ~~love~~ rockaoke. Heard of Karaoke? Yeah? All right now, imagine pumping on the stereo with a live band instead of a crappy backing track. And the crowd's like a seven nation army rocking all over the world to make you feel like a rockstar.   
      
**MAMA TOLD ME NOT TO COME, WHY SHOULD I GO??**            
After working 9 to 5, dont look back in anger... get crazy, go to Madame JoJos and give me all your lovin. What else are you gonna do, sit in the park all your life?              
        
**I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL BUT I SOUND LIKE A BAG OF CATS WHEN I SING**             
Oh, you're so vain... no one cares! Somebody told me rockoake isn't about perfect singing, it's just a time to play that funky music and all i wanna do is rock out.               
           
**I REALLY DONT WANT TO GET ON A STAGE**           
Don't panic... look on the mr bright side... we will rock you while you dance... i mean, i bet you look good on the dancefloor.               
       
**IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ROCKAOKE??**        
It's not unusual to sign yourself up to sing at rockaoke but *this* rockaoke is raising money for Red Nose Day.... which means that you can sign your friends up to sing songs and donate a bit of money money money to charity! I believe if your mate's a bitch and signs you up for some misery business you can beat it by donating a bit extra!              
       
Also it is Meg's leaving do thing, she's gonna go her own way so shout bye to her cause it's better than when you say nothing at all.               

**IS THERE SOMEWHERE I CAN FIND OUT MORE THAT ISN'T WRITTEN IN FUCKING RIDDLES**                
Alright papa, don't preach, common people would just go here to check it out [Rockaoke website](http://rockaoke.co.uk/)                 
If it makes you happy you can look at the [venue website](http://www.madamejojos.com/)         

**WHEN DOES IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN AND STUFF?**             
The band boys are back in town at about **18.30 and probably will start playing at about 7.30/8pm**
It's usually £5 entry, but i am reliably informed you can get in free if you say ""I'm megs super cool friend"". I'm not meg, so i don't know for 100%, but hit it with your best shot and if not then it's a fiver so make sure you have some brass in your pocket.                
         
               
Right... are you gonna go my way?

The night includes a [pub quiz](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/events/events_for_adults/Lates/subevent1.aspx) so that those of us who have lost our dignity can attempt to regain it... or just further our pride deficit.

I'm happy to be the point of contact- any interest?

**EDIT:** Interest seems high enough- I will station myself at ~~The Norfolk Bar~~ **[The Hoop and Toy] (http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/37/3741/Hoop_and_Toy/South_Kensington)** until 18h40, at which point we'll head off together to the museum.

**FINAL EDIT:** Everything's good to go.  One slight change- as it's bubblegumgills' birthday, there will be brownies at the Hoop and Toy.  Perhaps even singing.

**I guess that wasn't the final edit:** I'll show up at around 17h30.  Happy?

Any questions or confusion, call me at Oseven85seven11O1O2.  I have proven myself terrible at giving directions/recognizing landmarks/knowing up from down but I'll give it my best shot.

**Fine, one more edit:** The Right Honourable beavershaw has volunteered his contact info as he actually knows the area.  I cannot stress this enough: *if you are lost it is best to contact him*.  I'll probably just barely find the place on my own.  His number is oh78oh67oh9530.

A roll call from last thread is here, feel free to add your name.

8pm - [Village](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=site:village-soho.co.uk+village,+london&amp;hl=en&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=A)

Currently have an area reserved as a ""base"" starting at 8pm. Prepare for dingy camp, terrible music being played by a drag DJ that doesn't give a shit what the crowd wants to dance to and big guys in little boys underwear pole-dancing upstairs.

10pm, MAYBE - The Ku Bar, G-A-Y Bar, Profile etc.

If we feel like it, a change of scenery to a classier venue. Possibly also looking for cute boys that would be handing out flyers or wristbands outside these places to give us discounted entry into...

12am - [G-A-Y Heaven](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=G-A-Y+Heaven&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=21.435665,30.498047&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A)

Our final destination which will involve a bit of a walk from Soho to Charing Cross. The great dame of gay nightclubs in London. Big club with multiple rooms/floors and all the usual trappings that go along with that. 

We really should arrive here before midnight as it'll also be cheaper (£5 vs £10 I believe) and avoid ungodly queues.

ALSO: We can also [print out vouchers for entry here:](http://www.g-a-y.co.uk/?content=41)


**Advice**

BRING ID. Most places will have a strict 21 and over door policy.

I think we'll fine for dress code (smart/casual), just be at your fabbest :). Definitely bring any friends that're interested 'cause it's always helpful to keep a good ratio.

FYI If we're a massive group, due to possible attitude from door staff we may have to split up into smaller groups when queueing up at Heaven, afterwards which I have no doubt we will find each other inside.

Whatever happens in LSC stays in LSC. Please do not tag uploaded photos of anyone on Facebook without permission. However, material for /r/LondonGoneWild will be awesome.

Can't wait to see what happens!

Save the date, Saturday the 10th of December. Crawl will start at 1pm and follow a similar schedule as the last crawl with 2 hours being spent at each bar, ending up at our final bar at 9pm to dance/drink the night away.

The crawl will be centered around the Soho area, however bars are to be announced as we are waiting for confirmation that places can accommodate us. 

A roll call will start here, so if you are keen let us know so we can start to judge numbers. If you want to come later, just mention what time you are aiming for. 

To add to the Christmas Spirit, the idea of a Secret Santa at the Crawl has been floated. 

It will follow the format of people buying a gift with a £10 limit and bringing it along to place in ""Santa's Sack"". In return you will get a ticket to say you have put something in and then at the forth bar (7pm) All who have put into the sack can take a gift out. (Don't worry we will have a master list of names for the drunks who lose their tickets - Lowercase_drawer, I'm looking at you!!!).

My current thoughts are that the [Royal George](http://www.theroyalgeorgewc2.co.uk/findus/) pub from the pub crawl could do well, as it was suffieciently dingy and secluded, and had good space (and a piano).  My intention is to set up shop there from 2.30pm and not to leave until necessary.  

I will be bringing a magic bag of games:
[Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan): a game with the dubious honour of being the only time it is socially acceptable to shout ""I've got wood for your sheep!""
4 player ""construction"" and trading game, doesn't take too long, can transition to drinking rules if necessary.  I only have original, no expansions.  Bring 'em if you got 'em.

[Risk!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) a classic table top strategy and luck game (some argue more one than the other - the debate rages).  Up to 6 players undertake the conquest of Australia **AND THEN THE WORLD!**  Best known for causing friendships to fray: ""If you attack me you will lose more than your armies.""

[The Order of the Stick Adventure Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_stick#Board_game) is a game for up to six players.  Construct the dungeon as you explore, defeat evil or hilarious monsters, try not to screw each other over too much (but enough to make sure you are the winner).  Takes a long time to play - I've been meaning to purchase ""The Shortening"" which adds stuff and cuts down the play time a bit.  

[Scrabble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) Word game for 4 players - make words, get points, argue as to whether ""Reddit"" is a noun or a adjective.  Bring pen and paper - I won't remember to.

Magic Bag potentials:
Poker Kit - deck or cards and chips.  
Jenga.  Too much tension in a pub, perhaps?
Thud! The game based on the game from the Discworld books.  Two players.  

Will update this when I get home and look at my game shelf.  


Please post any comments, advice, demands, complaints, curses and blessings.

*First update* - the only game I had forgotten from my shelf were a box of dominos.  
Should I be tracking who has confirmed or somesuch?  I am new at this...  

Update the Second
Games people *claim* they are bringing:
 [Zombies!!!](http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/en/boardgames/zombies.html) from DownAndOutInLondon.

Go from die_troller, who seems to wish to train us all to think and act like Szun Tzu

[Carcassonne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29) from TheTame.

A kind LSC'er *may* be able to secure us access to his office in London Bridge for an LSC LAN. However, the max amount of people it can cater to is 12-16 (assuming most people are bringing laptops and only a few with desktops) so it's vital that we know just how many people are interested and can definitely come on the **11th of August?** I know it's a while away so some people won't be able to confirm whether or not they can definitely come but I consider it lucky we (may) have this venue at all :)

Though if anybody knows a place they can *definitely* secure for this to happen with a similar (or even, dare I say it, larger) amount of  space then please come forward :)

There is another option if we can't find a place to do it and that's to simply organise a gaming night where we all join the same VOIP (TS3/mumble/skype/whatever) and just play with each other (giggity) online. If it comes to that we can use the EU Tribes mumble as I have admin rights in my old team channel and I can just re-purpose it for the event. If we do it this way we can do it any day we want which is a plus, though we do lose out on the atmosphere of a proper LAN.

Last but not least - if we do manage to find a place to do this but we have a lot of people interested we can always combine the two options. I'm not sure how we'd decide who stays at home and who comes to the event but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Maybe a first come first served basis so nobody seems like the bad guy :P

So:

What are your thoughts on this? Anything that you'd change?

Can you come? Maybe come?

And how many people want to participate online because they can't come or would rather stay at home?

**Most importantly:** What games do people want to play?",,False,,t5_2s87x,1374595318.0,,,True,t3_1iw294,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/1iw294/interest_an_lsc_pc_gaming_event/,

Taking over the usual night from /u/Ruuh for this week and moving our humble Oxfam Kingston board game night to star studded Clapham Junction. Come on down! 

We'll be in the Secret Basement of Project Orange for an evening of fine beers, great games and super company! It's right outside the Upper Entrance of Clapham Junction and we have the whole basement (inc Table Football) to ourselves! Starts at 5.00pm!

FAQ

I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?

It will be more than alright - That's exactly how I started out coming to this night! Come down, try it out and make some friends. We love spreading the bug and we're (probably) the nicest people in all of gamingdom.

I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones I'll be dominating this time?

Depends on what people bring in. Usually it's Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, Settlers of Catan. If you've got your own that you wish to crush us with (literally or figuratively), bring it along!

Do I need to bring in anything?

Strong pair of trousers, some tastebuds for the excellent drink selection in Project Orange and any games you have.

Can I bring along some friends of mine?

As many as you want. Corral them into a huge pen, chain them into a working gang and bring them down, if you like. I guess. 

If you're coming, please do let us know in the comments. I'll PM remind you the evening before to give you a heads up.

SOUNDS ALARMING DOESN'T IT?

But don't worry everyone. I've done this before. And it went not-bad! So now I am going to literally wing it and make an event, just like that.

Tradition makes the first bit is easy, you just copy and paste it from the other time:

1. At 7pm meet at **The Cock** *27 Great Portland Street W1W 8QG*

2. Then er... at 7.45 move on to **The Yorkshire Grey** *46 Langham Street W1W 7AX*

3. At 8.30 move on to **The Horse and Groom** *128 Great Portland Street W1W 6PX*

4. At 9.15 - check this out everyone - we get the **C2 bus** into Camden and move on to **Brewdog** *113 Bayham Street NW1 0AG*

In case anybody is interested the first three are all really close together, and the third is really near the relevant bus stop, and the fourth likewise, OK. So don't count on this crawl to fulfill your exercise needs. Other than that it should be pretty jolly. Mmm, cheap Sam Smiths beer...

Anyway, for the benefit of info-seekers and lost-getters, I am on 07747 327749.

**Where do we play?**

We play in [Regents Park in Central London](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=207627779850726004772.0004d3d52e8f5207eecb0&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.525567,-0.150418&amp;spn=0.008037,0.019097). We meet outside Regents Park Tube Station at 14:00 on Sunday afternoons and then walk to the location marked on the map with the footballer. As you'll see the nearby pub is also tagged on the map for post match drinks! Its a Weatherspoons, YAY for £7 for BEER+BURGER!

**What If I cant play on Sundays?**


If you cant make it Sunday's or would like to play EXTRA, people meetup and play on **Saturday** at the same time and place as the Sunday session! 



**Who can come along?**

EVERYONE IS WELCOME, any sex, skill level, age, absolutely anyone can play with us, and if they don't feel like playing they are welcome to cheer, take pictures or referee.

**How much does it cost?**

Playing footy is ABSOLUTELY FREE! Some of us do sometimes go to the pub across the road to have a drink after the game, again all welcome.

Although FREE, we are currently collecting £3 per game to buy goals, bibs and cones, no pressure if you cant or if its your first time coming.

**What kind of footy do we play?**

It varies! We have played from 11-a-side to 3-a-side, but 5/7-a-side seems to be the most preferred format.

**How do I book?**

No booking needed, but if you post  in the specific day's post we will know how many people to expect

**Can I bring a friend?**

YES! BRING TWO! the more the better!

**I'd love to join in. Do I have to endure the embarrassing picking teams school playground style scenario?**

No! Our team selection seems to be quite fair, we divide into groups of what positions we wanna play: Defence, Midfielder or Attack, we then divide the groups by colour of t-shirt (we are racist that way) usually dark colours vs clear, after that, once we start playing if we see it's not even (and even if it's not) we swap a few players to make it more interesting. There is no bench, but you're welcome to take a quick breather or have a drink mid match.

**Can goalkeepers apply?**

We love Goalkeepers!

**Do you have multiple teams/games then?**

It depends on how many show up really. We had 17 turn up a few weeks ago so we stuck to 8v9 the whole time. The week before that we had 24 so we played 12v12 and after 90 minutes we split into 4 teams of 6 and did a mini league.

**What type of turnout have you had before?**

The turnout is now averaging around twenty to twenty five, with only a few exceptions which were down to snow or incredibly heavy rain.

**Do I need to bring anything?**

No, just your personal kit, however if you have a ball/pump then feel free to bring it, we normally have enough but too many is better than too few!


**I would like to play weekdays too, how do I join?**

Keep an eye on the subreddit! We currently play 6-a-side games on Wednesday (Stratford) and Thursdays (Camden Road) they normally go on a ""First come first serve"" system and bookup quite quickly!

So, a name change.. after the feedback thread here in LSC we found there were a lot of people calling for events in which everyone doesn't end up getting wasted.. I host one of these per week, but realised that with the name 'Hammersmith Drinks' that people may not realise.

I'll also include more thorough description of how the meet usually pans out each week. If anyone can think of a better name than Hammersmith Hang Out please do suggest it - I simple put meet up in a thesaurus.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average I get 5-7 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - just last week we had 3 people at their first LSC meet and 2 others on their 2nd (and 2nd Hammersmith meet)!*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices (I think) and water.*

Location/Time: [Latymers](http://latymershammersmith.co.uk/), W6 8BS / from 18:00ish

The table is reserved every Monday for the rest of the year. Hopefully the staff will remember each week.
If it is reserved it's the long table with 'sofa benches' on 3 side on the right as you enter the pub.

I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me.

As a bonus this week I'm not working Tuesday, and so will be able to stay the whole evening for once.

So, design us a badge **for the occasion** and post it here and it may get distributed to everybody on the day.


The top rated designs for the occasion that are posted here by *midday Monday* will get sent to the printer. (Providing they match the spec, and aren't MSPaint trollop).

The artwork *MUST* follow the template, and *MUST* be in CMYK and *MUST* be 300dpi.

**Templates**

- Photoshop - http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/New%20templates/25mm%20Template.psd
- Illustrator - http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/New%20templates/25mm%20Template.ai

The starting point and most important aspect of a printing job is your design. 
Making sure that your artwork file is sent across to us correctly is crucial...
Colour format: CMYK
File format: PSD, JPEG, TIFF, PDF, EPS, AI

*please note: we don't accept 72dpi files as they are not adequate to create a quality job*

**A few tips to get awesome results...**

1. Create artwork at 300dpi - the larger and clearer the file, the better it will print!
2. Use text wisely – small writing won’t show as well as bold, larger text (don't try to squeeze too much onto a 25mm badge!)

* There will be climbs.
* There will be drinking.

 * Myself and zombiecommand are going to be the organisers/judges. Lowercase_Drawer also expressed a preference for this, but he needs to confirm he's okay with not being personally involved with the hunt himself (see below for reasons). I don't think we need more than 3 really.

 * We've put together a spreadsheet listing the 80-odd items you can 'collect' a photo of. This will be distributed on the day (this is why the judges can't play). You'll get a higher amount of points for an item if you get it and no other teams do (or only a few do). There's also a multiplier for difficulty for some items, so you can get even more points. Finally, some items have ""nullifiers"" - basically, if you include a certain item in your photo when shooting something else, your score is 0. Sounds harsh? You love it. The idea is it adds a bit of drama and intrigue to proceedings. You won't know what the nullifiers are.

 * We'll all meet at a central location, give out the lists, and you'll have 6 hours or so to go and find things, photograph them, and return.

 * Judges will download your photos onto a laptop (bring USB cables / card readers!) and work out points and bonuses. After a few hours we'll hook the laptop up to a projector screen (if anyone knows any nice pubs that can do this, let us know!) and share everyone's photos and announce scores. 

 * There might be bonus points, prizes, audience-voting and general nonsense.

How does this sound to everyone? Are we all in?! Ideally this will happen on a weekend or bank holiday so everyone's available.

If you'd like to play, please post the following:

 * **Any dates you're not free (say in the next 2 months?)**
 * **If you'd like to be a team captain (teams will be 5-6 people so this depends on numbers)**
 * Any other questions, suggestions or comments.

Note that we have a pretty hefty list now of suggestions for items for the hunt itself so we don't need any more of those.

As with last year it's being held at Olympia and you can expect a whole range of beers from around the UK and the world beyond. There's also usually a good range of ciders and some wines for people who aren't big fans of beer, along with a whole host of different food options to keep your stomachs lined.

There's usually plenty of beer through the week, but as it starts to reduce in availability towards the end I figure that Thursday is a good day to go... especially as it's my birthday.

Tickets are £8 for CAMRA members and £10 otherwise; if you're not a member, joining up at the festival itself is usually a better call as you can get a whole load of swag there. This just covers your entry, you'll need to pay for the beers you drink when you get in.

If Thursday doesn't work for you, then /u/Londoner_85 is heading down on Saturday - [details here](/1jkan3).

1. I suggest changing the time to 7pm as many people say they can't make it. (sorry I forget some folks don't        get to finish to 3 :P) 

2. I don't mind the odd drink. I'm not super militant! I just am extremely uncomfortable around the merry folk, I just didn't want someone to turn up and be disappointed!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

The Thames festival is on this weekend, culminating in a night carnival parade and fireworks display along the river between the Blackfriars and Waterloo Bridges. The weather is forecast to be 27 and sunny on Sunday so it'll be a perfect evening for a riverside stroll. 

The parade starts around 7.15pm, and heads north along Blackfriars Bridge and then along the Victoria embankment so I propose we meet at Victoria Embankment Gardens (next to Temple station) at 7pm to watch the festivities. ~~(Or we could meet at Walkabout... Is that too cheesy?).~~ We can then head south of the river to find some food and hang out ready for the fireworks at 10.30pm.

Drinks and/or food,stephenwraysford,19,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/pbw0f/8212_the_cheshire_cheese_an_old_eccentric_pub/,"This week's social calendar is looking pretty bare, so I've decided to take matters into my own hands, and propose a pub meet at one of my favorite London pubs this Wednesday after work! 

The [Cheshire Cheese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Olde_Cheshire_Cheese) is a labyrinth of tunnels, cellars, tap rooms and bars extending underground and into the ancient building. The pub was rebuilt immediately after the Great Fire of London in 1666, predating by 40 years the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, although historical records indicate that a pub has existed here since 1538 (a mere 70 years before Jamestown, Virginia was colonised by the British, and Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent French settlement in Canada).

Anyway, if the age of the place is insufficient to convince you that it's worth dropping in for a fireside pint after work on Wednesday, I'll just mention that the pub serves no 'name brand' beers and spirits, being owned as it is by Sam Smith brewery in Yorkshire, the oldest brewery in the region founded in 1758. Oh, and it also counts among its more famous past regulars Charles Dickens, Voltaire, Thackeray, WB Yeats, Mark Twain, Tennyson, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  

The pub is always busy, so seating is at a premium. I will be there from 5:45pm, and will stay until kicking-out time at 11. There are a myriad of notable pubs to visit along the way, including [The Tipperary (1605)](http://pws.prserv.net/tipperarypub/), the [George (1723)](http://www.pubandbar-network.co.uk/pubs/venue_london_westminster_the%20george%20on%20the%20strand_864.html), and the [Coal Hole (1904)](http://fancyapint.com/Pub/london/coal-hole/599). If there is interest, I shall arrange a more full-spirited Pub Crawl around these famous pubs and more, at a later date. 

I'll update this post with the location in the pub that we manage to settle, or if/when there is onward movement.

The quiz is on the 6th of February at [The Hat and Tun](http://www.thehatandtun.com/index.php), it starts at 19:30 so ideally we should aim to meet at 19:00.

Let's be classy bastards for a month, and maybe even raise some cash for mens health issues.

I've done this before back in Australia, and it's a load of fun. All you have to do is this.

**Leading up to November 1:** Create a Movember page for yourself, and join the team 'Reddit London', [LINK](http://mobro.co/nicksmith) - Find the team on my page and join it.

**Then**, raise some moustache worthy money dammit. It's a for a good cause. People can donate to you via your Movember page when you've joined.

**Lastly, November 1:** Shave for the last time for a month. EVERYONE must begin clean-shaven. 

Remember, it's MOvember, not GOATEEvember or CHOPSvember. Moustaches only. No joining of facial hair to neck or sideburns.

Take a photo every day showing your majesty and grace. Post them online into your movember account, and have us judge and mock you.

~~**Finally**, in early december we will have a night on the town where we will show off our majestic growths to the world, judge them, and crown one of us as moustache champion of Reddit London. Sadly, I'm going to be in Australia until the 5th of December, so I hope you can all maintain your moustaches until the 10th of December for the gala event. It's only an extra 10 days!~~

**Ladies**, you're also welcome to join in the fun. If you can grow a moustache, then great! Otherwise, you can also register and raise money for some worthy causes.

I won't go into all the details here, but please check out [The Movember Website](http://uk.movember.com/about/) for more information.

Now get involved and get growing. Be a MoBro or MoSista. :$) (That's meant to be a moustache...)

Thank you to everyone for filling in the survey, thanks to the results I've picked the best weekend to suit the most people - Saturday 6th August.  

**When is it happening?** Saturday, 6th August.  It's an all day event, leaving from London Euston (probably - need to confirm) at 8am and getting back to London about 6ish.  The venue is the Oakwood paintball ground for [Horizon Paintball](http://www.horizonpaintball.co.uk) in Hemel Hempstead.

**How many people can attend?** The venue said we can fit a maximum of ""about 50"", as we've already hit that number I am confirming that with them.  First come first served in that regard.  There should be space on the coach for everyone attending the event.

**How much is it?** The paintball place are kindly extending the Groupon deal to EVERYONE who is joining us, so even if you didn't get a Groupon ticket, they will honour the same deal - All day entry, equipment hire, gun and 100 paintballs for £3!  Budget spending more money on more paintballs, lunch etc - I don't know how much these will be yet.

**What is this about a coach?** As we have so many people, we are going to get a PARTY BUS to take us there and take us back.  This is cheaper than the train/taxi, more flexible, and more fun :)  Cost should be about £10 each, possibly slightly less, will confirm closer to the day (Train is £12 and Taxi £4 each, or so)

**I already have a Groupon ticket, what do I do?** Send all your groupon PDF tickets (for yourself AND spares) to **paintball AT modernangel.org** with your reddit username (and names of +1s if you can).  I will pay you back for these (paypal or on the day), and send them to the Paintball venue.  Anybody who doesn't have a groupon ticket, will pay the venue directly (again £3 for the same deal).

**What do I do now?**  I have to ask you to properly confirm again in this thread, as this is the ACTUAL date and ACTUAL money will be involved.  I will be assuming that everyone needs a spot on the coach, *if you want to make your own way there then please say so*.

This is going to be epic!

**I have changed the original 3 bedroom apartment. We are now all in the same building and have a terrace to play on! We will be residing in the same building.**

It sleeps 8 people but we are going to have to book a second place. I have asked for 2 extra beds so we can fit all 8 there. It's a lot more spacious than the other place.

For late comers, we will more than likely have space for you to stay however there is no guarantee. Please message me if you're interested. 
Any questions, go ahead and ask...

**UPDATE** SECOND APARTMENT IS [BOOKED](http://www.prague-city-apartments.cz/large_view_en.html?detailID=953074&amp;photoID=20155&amp;res=600). [Website 2 bedroom, sleeps 4. Room 31 also](http://www.prague-city-apartments.cz/product/about_en_RESIDENCE_KARLOVA.html) Same building. This place will run us £158 each. Thank you all of those who helped. The stress is now over and we can finally plan activities and the fun parts of the trip! I will organize a meeting within the next few weeks!

Plus Special Announcement Inside",beavershaw,20,2,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/ftp02/official_reddit_circle_line_pub_crawl_this_friday/,"Just to remind people, the REDDIT (Really Extreme Drunken Debauchery Involving the Tube) Circle Line Pub Crawl is now less than a week away. You can find all the relevant details, including pub location and tentative times, in the previous posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/f8x3o/friday_march_4_reddit_circle_line_pub_crawl/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/f06jp/any_interest_in_doing_the_circle_line_pub_crawl/). Basically, just remember you will need an oyster card with I think £8 pounds on it (or all day zone 1 travel card), money for drinks and the desire to visit a whole bunch of pubs all over central London. If you plan on doing the whole thing please meet at the [O'Neills on Euston Road](http://www.oneills.co.uk/oneillskingscross/findus/) no later than 11:45am. I'll be there from around 11:30am and we will be leaving at noon sharp. 

**Now for the special announcement: To encourage people to get to O'Neills on time, the first 5 people to arrive get their first round on me and if they make it to the end, their last round too (assuming of course I'm still there by the end).** 

Finally, I just want to address a few questions/concerns/ideas that people have asked me about this. First, this crawl will not be a race, even though there seems to be some support for zombiecommand's [tongue-in-cheek idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/f8x3o/friday_march_4_reddit_circle_line_pub_crawl/c1e9392). I am not opposed to the idea in future, but this one it will operate like a regular crawl, just with more pubs and less time at each. In terms of drinks it is highly recommended you stick to half-pints or single shots. 

If you want to have a different type of drink at each pub please feel free to do so, however I'll be sticking to halfs to minimize my hangover on Saturday. Since, this is a drinking related activity participants should be 18+. Fancy Dress (or costumes for us North American Redditors) is encouraged but not required. I know PortConflict will be putting on his finest. There is absolutely no requirement to drink at each pub or drink alcoholic drinks. 

Times and pub locations listed in the previous post, are subject to change. Basically, we'll proceed as quickly as we can catch the tube, get to each pub, order and consume beverages. So, if meeting part way through the crawl please text me at:  to find out where we are. Also, if one other person can post his/her number as backup, it would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR – The REDDIT Circle Line Pub Crawl is this Friday (March 4). Start 11:30am [O'Neills on Euston Road](http://www.oneills.co.uk/oneillskingscross/findus/).

**Edit1:** InsertRandomName has generously offered to allow me to post her number in case my phone's not working. It is.

**Edit2:** I'm heading out in a few minutes. Looks as though we should have around a dozen people for the start and pick up at least another dozen as the day goes on. I am amazed that there this many people willing to give the circle line a go. I think this is going to be a lot of fun. See all of you out there.

**Edit3** Great night last night. I seem to have lost my phone not sure if anyone has it, but if you do could you please message me.

**Just wanted to thank everyone for the amazing day yesterday, especially those who did the whole thing. Both the wife and I had a great time and she was really like meeting all of you who were out for the beginning.  PortCoflict's fancy dress was definitely the hit of the day. No, idea how I got home. I have a vague recollection of using and falling off a Barclay's bike. I assume that's why my foot hurts and how I lost my phone.

Please excuse me - I suggest you all text Kaer (sorry!), he knows things.**

Following the relative success of our little trip to see Tosca, it might be rather nice to gather ourselves to watch some more, beamed live to the masses in Trafalgar Square!


So get yourself down to Trafalgar Square at about 6:50pm, it's a free event, and **definitely bring a cushion** or suchlike. You'll be sitting in the square itself, watching a giant screen. The bonus of a free screening is that you can wander off, if you like.


We can get food first (TBA), then settle in a group before it begins.


The opera is [La rondine](http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/la-rondine-by-nicolas-joel), a story about love (as usual), jealousy and forgiveness. It's got a few smashing tunes in it, and features a very famous singer in the lead role.

That was awesome. There was one paintball event after that as well, which was also awesome. 

I happened to miss both of those, and now I'm sick of hoping someone would organise another outing, so i'm doing this myself. 


**Date**:  I've set up a Doodle poll [here](http://doodle.com/6gz74xw8xcbw26eg) - I think the best days would be either of the May bank holiday weekends, but obviously, enter the dates that work for you in there, and we'll sort out the one that works most conveniently for all

**Place** - there are a few options, but I'd say the best one is IMO [Horizon Paintball Essex](http://www.horizonpaintball.co.uk/step2) which is walking distance from Upminster tube station. 

Now - I've spoken to the people at Horizon paintball, and they say if we get more than 50 people (which shouldn't be hard, that's a standard Wednesday night for us!! ) they can do it for £5.87 per person, which includes all equipment and 50 paintballs. An additional 100 paintballs can be acquired for £7.99 (£6.99 if you get over 1000 at a go). I've provisionally got a booking for Sunday the 5th (which is lurvely because (a) the 6th is a bank holiday and (b) there is jack shit on the LSC calendar that day!

What are you waiting for, get involved!

Let me rattle this off quickly. Tis my 28th birthday this weekend, and I wanted to invite the LSC crowd to come and help me celebrate this bad boy. This group has given so much to me since Global meetup day 2011, and without the legends of LSC, I would not have:

* A naked portrait of me in circulation.
* Bungee-jumped.
* Been smashed with paintballs.
* Heard of Meatliquor or Bodeans.
* Got into double figures for pub crawls last year.
* Celbrated my 27th birthday in style at the Old Blue Last.
* Organised a St. Patrick's day piss-up.
* Developed a taste for Drum and Bass.
* Had my ass handed to me in a professional Tekken 6 tournament.
* Had a party popper explode in my eye.
* Frenched Jobson.
* met as many awesome people in this city as one can possibly meet.

And so all those of you who I know and love, as well as the newbies I have yet to meet, you are all invited to a night out in Dalston, Shoreditch's sexy cousin.

We will be kicking off in the [Marquis of Lansdowne](https://plus.google.com/112043915317557235191/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) from 8:00pm, which was one of the spots in the Dalston pubcrawl not too long ago. From there, once we has warmed up, around 10:30-11, we will head to Efe's Pool Hall(https://plus.google.com/108589246600186838061/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en), a hipster pool hall/night club with cheap beer, dancefloor and the hipsterestest clientele you will ever lay eyes upon. 

Efe's is open till 6 in the mornin, heavens know how long the party will last.

I'll be on Zero 75 Double Zero 5813 Zero 2 that day if you need directions.

Mondays are for chilling.. 

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average I get 5-7 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices (I think) and water.*

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

Location/Time: [Latymers](http://latymershammersmith.co.uk/), W6 8BS / from 18:00ish

The table is reserved every Monday for the rest of the year. Hopefully the staff will remember each week.
If it is reserved it's the long table with 'sofa benches' on 3 side on the right as you enter the pub.

There'll be events and displays of museum research and probably tours too...

It's a free event and has 8 bars! It's open from 4pm until late. More details to come...

* edit.

Okay, so I probably won't be there till 5:30, so if you are planning on arriving before then the best thing to do would be to meet under Dippy (the big Diplodocus in the main hall) or up the stairs at the back of the hall by the statue of Darwin. Similarly, I can meet people by Dippy at half five if you get lost or can't find the rest of us. Signal is patchy in the museum but I'll keep an eye out! Or maybe at the Cocktail Bar in the Darwin Centre!

Mobile: oh79zero99two354one - **Meet at 5:30 by Dippy's Tail** - I have a blue long sleeve shirt on...

Or if you are earlier, The Hoop and Toy by South Kensington station is the easiest place outside of the museum to meet.

Purely for interest.  This is not me suggesting you need to organise anything.  All I'm suggesting is to attend and be awesome with us :)

My code flagged and removed non-event meetups (chat, pics, spam &amp; dupes), so the counts may be slightly out (false positives and true negatives).  Also a few events were jointly done, it just flagged who posted it.

Only runs from events from Mid August 2011 - 27th August 2012.  So there's a whole bunch of events organised previously that it didn't count.  Total events in a little over a year is **694** organised by **191** different &amp; bloody wonderful people.

A pub crawl I can walk home from.  So suck it! :p

Just finished chatting to a few of the pubs.  I will get confirmation shortly, but a few will be doing LSC special deals.  At least on jugs of cocktails (Drink Responsibly!)

Pubs may change, but all pubs will be a 5 minute walk from the Crystal Palace Triangle.  All pubs have an outdoor beer garden, if shock, horror, the weather is actually any good in September.

https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crystal+Palace+Triangle&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en

**12-3 pm : The Grape and Grain.**  http://thegrapeandgrainse19.co.uk/

Anerley Hill, Crystal Palace, London SE19 2AA

A fantastic boozer, which even has a brand new pub dog (a lovely german shepherd cross puppy).  Mix of real ales and unique beers.  Good pub food.  Also discount for CAMRA members.  3 * 1/3 pint tasters for same price of a pint.

**3-5pm : The Alma.** http://www.thealmapub.com/ 

95 Church Road, Crystal Palace, London , SE19 2TA

An okay little boozer in the corner of the triangle.  I preferred it before it got gastropubified.

**5-8pm : The Postal Order**  : http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-postal-order-crystal-palace

2-33 Westow Street, Crystal Palace, Greater London, SE19 3RW

Yes it's a weatherspoons.  Yes it's a bit shite.  Yes it has cheap food &amp; booze.  This is a pit spot to replenish.  Granted we also make any place awesome.  No beer garden though.

**8pm-2am: Westow House** http://www.westowhouse.com/

79 Westow Hill  Gipsy Hill, London SE19 1TX

They have a pub cat &amp; table tennis table.  Sat nights are normally some sort of either band or DJ.  And after 11ish there is dancing.  Also large beer garden.  Free entry.  We're there until 2am.

**2-&gt;?** You are on your own.  Usual suspects my spare room &amp; couch is available for crashing

Night buses run to Brixton &amp; Elephant and Castle.  I'm normally coming the other way, so bah.  £30 is my usual minicab fare from Camden.  But you can work out yourself how to get home.  Crystal Palace Station runs trains to 11:30 to either Victoria or London Bridge.

Mobile is Brad 0 double 7 603 897 double 6.  But I will post/update this closer to event day with 100% confirmed details.

I'll be dropping Charlie off home during the second pub, so ping Nick on 07818 6 double 7 1 double eight to find the group.  But this neck of London is normally fairly quiet, so just look for the large group.

Charlie will be attending at least the first pub.

So if you get there early, look for him.

We're inside The Edge just off of Soho Square.

**Where:** Soho Square

**Time:** 1pm, 7th July 2012

Call out to anyone that wants to have a drink and wander around Soho and area, take in the atmosphere of World Pride Day. Probably the best way to do it in light of the setbacks around the organisation itself.

There's many events going on that night so a lot of us won't be out beyond the early evening.

**Meet at Soho Square at 1pm**,
Hang out over some drinks in the park, then eventually wander around Soho and down to Trafalgar Square where most of the official festivities are happening.

I know it'll be late dinner, but I hope people won't mind. To ease our possible hunger pangs we can have some beigels on Brick Lane at the start of the walk! At the moment the weather looks to [be rain free for the evening](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/se/london_forecast_weather.html), but in case it pours, we'll just have to improvise. Here's a [map](http://goo.gl/maps/J8Ei) showing where the suggested venues are. The route between the places will be decided on the day.     

Got a digital camera? (Yes.) Not sure how to get the best out of it? (Ummm… how do I switch this thing on?) Not familiar with all the features? (What do you mean I can do more with it then just point and shoot?) Come join a photowalk with tutoring from our resident professionals! All levels of skills and cameras welcomed. Heck, you can join us even if you don’t have a camera! Just be prepared to be photographed. A lot.  

We're meeting at [The Water Poet](http://www.thewaterpoet.com/), 9-11 Folgate Street Spitalfields, London E1 6BX, since this is a place LSCers know well. I get out of work at 5pm, so I shall hang around there from 5.30ish. I presume we will venture onwards at around 6.30-7pm.  

Keeping in mind that we want to explore the settings of our cameras in different lights, I’m not sure which is best, to eat first and then head out to take photos or have late dinner? What do you people think? Sunset will be at [21.13](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=136&amp;month=6&amp;year=2012&amp;obj=sun&amp;afl=-11&amp;day=1). Suggestions for the best (I’ll settle for tried and tested) Indian on/around Brick Lane are kindly received.  

I shall update this with more details of route and timings at some point. Also please let me know if I’ve forgotten some important detail.  

And just to keep things entertaining and suitably juvenile, I suggest a photobomb competition.  

Rules:  

* A bomb is qualified only if you’re not the intended subject of the photo being taken (i.e. you jump into the frame at last minute or to the background of others posing for a photo)  
* You must look in to the camera **edit** I'd say it's preferable to look into the camera, but no biggie if the bomb is a quality one otherwise   
* **MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL:** you must make a silly face  

I shall judge this competition, if anyone else would like to be part of the panel, please let me know. Both quantity and quality shall be taken into account. I also have to ask to please be mindful of the fact that people will try to take some good, proper photos too, so don't just go for quantity. The beauty of a good photobomb is the execution and the element of surprise. And don't forget the silly face! The winner will get a framed shot of his/her bomb and a drink. That is all.

This saturday is the mighty saint patricks day, the day all Irish people honour those who have died of public inebriation in the years gone past. Following frequent pub crawls and almost daily binge drinking for some, I think we are ready.

I wanted to get an LSC event together for this, but I'm very aware that all Irish pubs in the city will be packed, so I wanted to hear suggestions from others on what we can do that doesnt involve prolonged, enforced, point blank eye-contact with a stranger due to cramped conditions. Anyone have any ideas?

I'm happy to organise it, so let me know what your thoughts are on what we could do. I will see what ideas we have by tomorrow evening, and will set it up.

Suggestions doesnt have to be irish themed at all, lets just do something for the craic!

Few talks and activities also going on.  £2 suggested donation, but if you're poor, they don't mind.

If you are still feeling soppy that evening, take a quick tour of the anatomy section of the museum.  If severed human body parts in jars don't kill your warm fuzzy feelings, you are an incurable romantic (or insane)....

Meet up @ The George IV pub at 6:30ish pm (28-30 Portugal Street, WC2A 2HE)

Heading on down to the Hunterian Museum around 7pm.  (35-43 Lincoln's Inn Fields  London WC2A 3PE).

9pm event ends and, surprisingly, we shall probably end up back in a pub.

ruthmf shall be your point of contact, (look for the woman attempting to be nice) : o781six845six73

If anyone else plans to get there earlier and wants to be point of contact, holler.

I'll be there around 7:30pm and if it ain't snowing I'll be riding in(since i'm not drinking this month), so calling me shall prove to be fairly useless, but anyway my mobile is 0 double 7 603 897 double 6.

It's very busy, hipsterly, and fun, and some of the art is really great (the rest will make you feel that you, too, could be an artist).

If you look at the map, many of the galleries are clustered near Shoreditch High St Overground, so I suggest we meet there. Sadly I can only get there at 8pm, which should give us 1-2 hours of art (it doesn't really end at 9) and we can then move on to some lovely Shoreditch bar or pub.

This post will change to reflect whatever the consensus is - at the moment there are people doing BOTH meets.  If you post where you plan to be I'll do a roll call.

[**Meet 1 Southsiiiide - Blackheath Fireworks Display 8pm**](http://www.londontown.com/LondonEvents/Blackheath-Fireworks/e4b3e)

The display itself is FREE with a suggested donation, starts at 8pm.  Likely to be pretty spectacular and busy, so get there earlier (7:30?)  Nearest tubes / trains Blackheath, Lewisham, Maze Hill.  Overland and DLR.

  - **Attire?** the less the better. Minimum SPF of 30 recommended. Panda suits positively encouraged. 

  - **Frisbee?** we should have Aerobies and lighty - uppy frisbees, and we got a bunch of borderline alcoholics... this should be good.

  - **BBQ?** Nope. We would get caught, and then we would be banned, and then what would we do? Besides, eating is cheating.

  - **Football?** could someone get this please? 

  - **Board Games?** If there's any unfinished business from the [previous day](http://redd.it/kowdj), why not? All risk of boards and game-pieces and cards being lost is borne by owner. r/Londonsocialclub, reddit.com and conde nast accept no liability for loss, damage, injury or death.

  - **Swimming?** There is a lido, and the Hampsead Heath Ponds, and I intend to swim. Bring trunks/costumes and towels. Goggles, swimming caps, snorkels, flippers, scuba gear as per personal preference. 

  - **Contact?** If you need assistance / directions / a shoulder to cry on / a pack alpaca, call me on 0 double seven 6 double nine triple seven 90. If anyone else want's to volunteer their phone number for general co-ordination purposes, post in thread, I'll put it up here.

I'm new to the city by way of Northeast USia and know just a few people around here. I'll be around for a few months and in that time, it seems like a good idea to get to know people. So rather than appealing to a few of you to show me around and provide introductions, I had it in my head that it might be more fun/terryfing to host/organize something.

So I have an idea! I'd like to propose a photography outing in the city. Interested parties bring their cameras to an agreed upon site. If we gather more than a handful of people, we break off into pairs or trios (swarms of people with photo gear get noticed or look like gaggles of tourists). After a while, the group as a whole reconvenes at someone's favorite pub to drink, eat, review our work, and drink.

I don't know what the skill level within this subreddit is, but a possible added ""feature"" might be an offering of a technical walkthrough on whatever cameras happen to be brought along with myself and anyone else who feels up to it before we begin.

So I'm gauging interest and soliciting for input. I've not put a tremendous amount of thought into what areas we might go to or when.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

How should the scientific community seize this moment, and work together with government and the public and private sectors to make Britain the best place in the world to do science?

He demonstrates dedication to influencing politicians and science funders and remains fully committed to his pioneering research in particle physics.

It's that time of year again when the entire world holds its breathe for another thrilling **US Election Edit: Number is ohseven 57 eight 6sevenseven 434
Edit: Number is ohseven 57 eight 6sevenseven 434
Edit: Number is ohseven 57 eight 6sevenseven 434
Bonanza**! 

After 50 debates, endless gaffes and hundreds of millions of dollars (if not billions) spent by superpacs it all comes down to **one night.** Will the veteran Obama regain his crown or will he succumb to a war of attrition with Mitt ""binders full of women"" Romney? 

**If you've never watched a US Election Result before**
Thanks to the US Electoral College system- US Elections are pretty fun to watch! There's constant news streaming in and celebrations when state results are announced. Nevermind the fact that it's one of the least fairest or democratic voting systems available (those who've studied voting theory will know)- we get a night of entertainment! 

**Location:** Is at the Lexington, an American Bar on the main road between Angel and King's Cross. http://www.thelexington.co.uk/event?id=1817

This was the best place that had no cover-charge with a pretty good location for night buses. There's also loads of bars and restaurants nearby if anyone wants to pop out for a bit.  

**Time:** Looking to start around **6-7** to at least get the places, but be warned- results will only be announced at 3 AM at the earliest- so for all intents and purposes - treat this night as an allnighter. 

**Election Night Drinking Game!**: A drinking game will be invented for the night's enjoyment and potentially bingo if I find the time.

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE**

We have 50 or so people confirmed attending. The bar are operating a first come first serve basis and they've experienced a huge surge in demand so aren't doing reservations (They said they expect 200-300 people to show up). We need people to help set up camp and get stuff on as many seats as possible for redditors! Please help by coming as early as possible and dropping your stuff off. Then go enjoy Angel- eat out, watch a film, etc. But we need bodies! Edit: Number is ohseven 57 eight 6sevenseven 434

Looks like we had a lot of interest in a Reddit football game, and rather than have only a few of us able to play on the rental pitch (maximum would be 14), Kaer and Somewhatoff suggested we have kickabout in a park, which I think is a great idea!

So I thought **Sunday 1st of July** would be a great day to have on, as it is the day of the Euro 2012 final, which at this stage could potentially include England(although not likely :P). The [weather forecast](http://uk.weather.com/weather/dailyDetails-London-UKXX0085?dayNum=9) for that day so far looks pretty decent too, although you never know how that will turn out this far ahead, but lets give it a whirl anyway. If they are wrong and its raining we can go teepee the Met Office instead.

[**Regents Park**](http://goo.gl/y0yO7) is probably our best bet, and we should be able to find good space to play, and it will be jumpers for goalposts, which should make you all misty-eyed for your bygone youth. 

If anyone has any football jerseys, or training bibs, bring them down and we can give players on the same teams similar jerseys. I have a load of black and white jersey, which might be the handiest colours to get.

I'll bring along the footballs, some water and the necessary sunscreen if I'm to be out in the sun for more than four minutes. 

Everyone is welcome! There is no requisite skill level, anyone who wants to play can play, if we have enough people and space we can have a proper 11-a-side game, with tag-in tag-out subs.  Even if you dont want to play, it should be good fun to come and watch us fall about the place, while you engage a can of beer on the sideline :) I'll be there for 2pm, and we can go for the traditional Sunday Kickoff time of **3pm**

After we're all worn out, we can go watch the Euro 2102 football final at a pub nearby. Anyone have any suggestions for that? If we are all footballed out and just want a pint, I suggest [Green Man](https://plus.google.com/104250488519511255136/about?hl=en), I dont think they show the footy.

Let me know if you are coming, and I'll add you name to the list here. Any other suggestions for this please let me know

Give me a call or a text on the day or before if you need know anymore: 075 double zero 58 13 zero 2 

Here is a [map of Regent's park](http://i.imgur.com/hT42s.jpg), marked with an red X where we will be playing footie. The closet stations are Regents Park(b
Bakerloo), Great Portland Street(Circle/Hammersmith/Metropolitan), Camden Town (Northern)and Saint Johns Wood(Jubilee). We are playing just behind london zoo.

Hope to see you all there :)

I'm organising, so I can do what I want! :)

Here are the trophies you could win:

http://i.imgur.com/zmK9R.jpg

For starters, you do not need to drink whisky.  SMWS does have other drinks there.   After the event we will head to a pub, most likely The Crown Tavern - http://www.thecrowntavernec1.co.uk/

Firstly, on the baking competition.  Anything goes.  There are no heating facilities at SMWS apart from a microwave.

2 categories:

* Sweet
* Savoury (anything not covered by Sweet)

There will be 5 judges.  There will also be a popular vote as well.

Currently:

* Kaer
* Saltsman
* beavershaw
* barc0de
* somabc

I will supply plates, forks, knives, spoons.

If you are entering, PM me and let me know what you intend to make (that's if you wish it to be a big surprise).  I won't squeal, but as I said if I give a list to the SMWS they will do a whisky pairing.  There will be prizes!  (nothing flash though :)

**Baking (14 ppl) :**

* Kaer (Confirmed what he's baking)
* Wandelation  (Confirmed what he's baking)
* robot_scream (Confirmed what she's baking)
* Cherea (Confirmed what she's baking)
* antonia90 (Confirmed what she's baking)
* bubblegumgills (Confirmed what she's baking)
* arseoutofthemselves (Confirmed what she's baking)
* fross (Confirmed what he's baking)
* yazola  (Confirmed what she's baking)
* minax + 1 (Confirmed what thay are baking)
* Blah_Blah_Blag (Confirmed what she's baking)
* Mancalime
* toxicifswallowed (Confirmed what they are baking)
* le_chef (Confirmed what he's baking)


**Savoury (3 ppl):**

* jaymeekae
* robot_scream (Confirmed what she's cooking)
* bubblegumgills (Confirmed what she's cooking)
* microbio_girl (Confirmed what she's cooking)

The whisky tasting will be **£36** for 5 drams.  As those who have done the tasting before know, this is damn good whisky.  We had one from a closed distillery last time and a 29 year old as well.  You will also be pissed at the end.  If you wish to do the whisky as well, give me £36 when you see me next or you can paypal it to me.  Chris (who a lot of you know) will do the tasting, and he's a great bloke. Not as much focus on whisky, as we're focussing on baking, short 5 minute spiel on society then he will be around to help out on whisky/baking.  The tasters are basically getting us the room for free...

**Whisky Tasting (11 ppl):**

* Kaer (paid)
* die_troller
* SoulShock (paid)
* barc0de 
* darth_ash (paid)
* beavershaw
* howling_moon (paid)
* gladsome
* le_chef
* dalore
* sk3tch (paid)

There will be a £5 entrance fee if you aren't bringing baked goods/participating in the whisky.  This will cover a few prizes for the winners.

**Eating (1 ppl):**

* minax's plus 1
* le_chef's plus 1
* mpostle

**Total Count: 33+ ppl max (30 ppl)**


The room will comfortably hold 20 seated.  Easily hold 30 standing/seated.  Major preference is given to bakers, then whisky drinkers, then eaters.

I'll be there from 5pm.  We'll kick off the comp at 6pm.  Finish around 9, then head down to the pub for a post comp bevy.

Scotch Malt Whisky Society Location:

http://www.smws.co.uk/venues/19_Greville_Street,_London
19 Greville Street  London, Greater London EC1N 8SQ

Look for Bleeding Heart Tavern.  It's down the side street there, rather discrete door.  Just come on up, tell them you're here to bake (or with Brad).

 - **Q: How many people will come?** Last year we hit 200ish visitors between 3pm and 8pm. By that point our census takers decided they had had enough. But people kept coming.

Most acts don't make it through the first minute. Somehow the MC ties it all together and even the terrible acts end up being hilarious.

Starts at 8pm. Tickets are £8/5. (Available on the door)

Some of us ended up at this [pool place](http://theelbowroom.co.uk/westbourne/) a few weeks back and it was fun so let's do this again! Bonus for the potentially awesome [New York style pizza joint](http://www.mulberrystreet.co.uk/index.html) across the road.

**When:** Tuesday the 18th of October, food from 7pm / pool from 8.30 or so.

**Where:** Mulberry Street Pizzeria (84 Westbourne Grove, W2 5RT) then across to The Elbow Room (103 Westbourne Grove,London, W2 4UW).

**How to get there:** Bayswater, Queensway, Royal Oak and Notting Hill tube stations nearby. Buses 7, N7, 23, 27, 70 - stop ""Chepstow Road / Westbourne Grove"" is just outside, TFL map [here](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/gettingaround/maps/buses/?r=westbourne grove)


Pool tables are £10/hour each. There's plenty of seats and full bar with food for any latercomers or anyone who doesn't want to play.

My number is 078 oh 4924 7 three 8 if you are lost, late, early, confused or somewhat in trouble. 
**If you're on roll call and can't make it please let me know.**

ps - No more towel jokes please.

Any LSC redditors out there with a bike? I was thinking of arranging a motorcycle ride? I'm not sure if this is in the ethos of social club, because it requires a bike so its not all inclusive. But I'm sure if a few of us wanted to do it we could include a few pillion spots for people wanting to join in? This could be fun, alternative and cheap thing to do :)

Any riders fancy a day trip?

EDIT: If most people are on 'L' plates I will make sure its a legal/achievable route for 125cc bikes and scooters.

EDIT 2: This was just a quick message to see if there was any interest. It seems like there is! I'll get a route and date arranged and make a post nearer the time (Ride will probably be late September), I'll also get on /motorcycles and /london to drum up a few more people. Once we have a rough number we can work out how many pillions we can take. 

Right now I'm thinking, meet up early, ride, have some lunch, ride some more. Then home with maybe a few beers in central once the bikes have been put to sleep. Possibly do London to Brighton and back on some nice scenic backroads. Nothing is set in stone for a route, I'm open to suggestions and we can take a vote if need be.

EDIT 3: Awesome, looks like this should be a good turnout, keep your eyes peeled and I will post something up within the next week or so.

For anybody that is unsure of redditors, use the phrase **The narwhal bacons at midnight** and you shall be forever welcome to the community!

12pm - The Cock, 27 Great Portland St, London W1W 8QE

1pm - Market Place Bar, 9/10 Market Place, London W1W 8AQ

2pm - The Adam and Eve, 77A Wells St London W1T 3QQ, food is also available here for those who have not eaten beforehand

3pm - The Eagle Bar, 3-5 Rathbone Place London W1T 1HJ

5pm - TBC, need a place between the eagle bar and the Montagu Pyke

7pm - The Montagu Pyke, 105-107 Charing Cross Road London WC2H 0DT

9pm - TBC, need a place we can reserve and has music, can be one or two bars depending on how people feel

For those new to the pub crawls, expect everybody there, as drunk as possible, with more alcohol than you can shake a stick at, pretty much like all reddit events.

Right, I'm guessing we're going to have around 40 people for bowling :\ which pretty much forces us into private room territory.

Format:  
6 teams of no more than 7 (puts a hard cap on bowlers at 42, though room can accommodate ~70).  
Each team bowls 2 games of 5 frames.  
2 highest scoring teams at the end of all the games play off in the final.  

For those not involved in the current game of bowling there is karaoke and a Wii set up (could even play Wii bowling!) and while I doubt it'll be quiet with karaoke if anyone wants to set up a few ipod playlists we can get that on too.

Cost is £420 for 12:00 - 15:30 and would mean a slight delay on the crawl part, but this seems the only way it's workable.

To confirm the date is Saturday the 28th of May.

Can I get hard confirms for the bowling (/karaoke/wii) in here please, as I don't want to be left with a £420 bowling bill :) It'll doubt it'll be any more than £10 each.

LSC has visited the cave a few times before, and it's been great fun each time. For the uninitiated Resident Advisor has the [**tickets** and a better description](http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?507157), with the tickets increasing in price as they sell through the earlier batches in the time to the event. It's a couple of months away I know, but the first two releases have gone already and in the past they've always sold out so get involved.

They've got a [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/tothelazercave/) for people interested in their previous pre-party mixes, or just after some tunes to listen to in the meantime.

The venue is **Autumn Street Studio Unit 3, 39 Autumn Street London E3 2TT**, but before that we'll head for a few drinks at **[Crate Brewery](http://www.cratebrewery.com/)** from **7pm**. It's a little out of the way but if you head left out of the station then turn left onto Rothbury/White Post Lane, it's just down by the canal *before* you cross the bridge to the Olympic park. In the past we've been there until about 10:30pm or so before heading down to the main venue, but it might be easiest to ping me a message if you're going to be there close to then.

I'll stick my phone number up here on the night so you can find us at the pub... and will try my best to find people once we get to the cave if people get there later.

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few who will eat there, the food is standard pub grub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

Location/Time: [Queens Head](http://queensheadhammersmith.co.uk/), W6 7BL / from 18:00ish

If you're coming from the station it'd be a bit faster to walk down Shepherds Bush Road and then enter brook green on the right rather than the normal route to Latymers down Hammersmith road and entering brook green on the left.

We'll be out back in the beer garden, I'll try to update this on the day with where in the garden.

I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me. Be aware I might not have signal in the Pub Garden.

I'm working shitty hours this week (and next week) and so won't be there before 18.30, a little later if I go get changed first.

The venue is the [AAA](http://www.aaa.uk.net/) on Kensington High Street, you can check out the song selection [here](http://www.rockaoke.co.uk/rockaoke_songs.php).

We start off the night just a few doors up in The Goat Tavern at 6:30pm, before heading to the AAA before 9 (usually about 8pm ish).
If you arrive after 9 its £6 on the door. The Goat serves food also.

If you've not been: it's like Karaoke... with rock music... on-stage with a live band. It's good fun, even if you don't sing.

London gay pride is on Saturday and thought it would be fun to go along and watch the parade and then possibly continue the festivities in a nearby bar.

It goes without saying that everyone is welcome - gay, straight or otherwise.

^1 There was some confusion about this set-up last time. Allow me to clarify:


* If 6 people show up on the day and we schedule 3 hours of drawing, everyone needs to pose for half an hour.

Well, both groups represent the human condition, and as Montaigne said, ""I am human, nothing human is truly alien to me."" And uh... *getting tenuous now... gonna need to cut the bullshit and organise this thing... pull yourself together*... yeah. Well, two weeks ago this is what we had, and it was great.

1. At 7pm meet at **The Cock** *27 Great Portland Street W1W 8QG*

2. At 8pm move on to **The John Snow** *39 Broadwick Street W1F 9QP*

3. At 8.40pm we're going to **A Car Park** *Poland Street W1F 9JQ* so that we can see GOOD OLD NICK, REMEMBER HIM? Anyway it turns out he needs us to help push his car because the battery died, and it happens to be right between these two pubs so we are going to do this and add a little HELP to the world instead of nothing but amusement.

4. At 9pm move on to **The Duke of Argyll** *26 Great Windmill St W1D 7LQ*

5. At 10pm move on to **The White Horse** *45 Rupert St W1D 7PB*

Nearest tube is Ox Circ for the first two, Pic Circ for the last two.

If you need further assistance our delightful operatives will be on standby, just ring 07804 92473eight.

Keen observers will observe that we are starting at the same place as before, only this time, our voyage of discovery will take us South into Soho, instead of East into whatever that bit is called. This is in homage to /u/Lazek, who came up with the whole idea, and made all London tingle with his illustrious presence.

PS I do not see it as my job to arrange foodments as part of this, but what I *have* done is make the end stages quite close to several fast food places. Last time some people went off for a bit to have a burger, and that worked out fine.

##Directions to the place are [HERE](http://d.tt/lzNDJWR3). Note that the District line is down that day. HOWEVER - C2C services (National Rail) are running to Upmister from Fenchurch St, Limehouse, West Ham or Barking. Greater Anglia have a service from Liverpool Street to Upminster as well. 

**AIM TO GET THERE FOR 8.45, TO GET TO THE PAINTBALL CENTER FOR 9.15**. If we co-ordinate numbers, it's about £2.50 p.p to get a cab from the station to the venue. Or we can traipse through the fields if it's a nice morning. 

###All paintballers have to register, so fill [this](http://db.tt/vGI6HIL0) out and bring it with you. Don't worry if you forget, you'll just have to do it there when you arrive.

The [Doodle has spoken](http://redd.it/1bljyb), and Sunday the 5th worked for most people, so there we have it! We shall be shooting projectiles filled with dye at high velocities at each other. Isn't it _EXCITING!!_!_!!_

Unfortunately, they didn't mention the 29p booking fee, so it's NOT £5.87 as originally claimed, but £6.16. I assure you, i argued, cajoled, coaxed and remonstrated valiantly for the better part of an hour, but to no avail. They're very good negotiators. So I've put down a deposit for the first 20 players to reserve us a spot. ~~The first 19 to confirm here or with me personally have the privilege of paying me directly instead of dealing with the fellows at Horizon Paintball.~~

~~If you're not in the initial 20,~~ The first 20 have already put their hands up - if you're in, call up Horizon Paintball -  01483 211194. Tell them you're part of a booking already made - give them my postcode (E1 1ER), my first name (Nihalf) and surname (Mohammed) and they will give you the discounted rate.

Once you're booked in, post here. 

So, the details - we'e expected to get there for 9.15 AM. The place is a healthy 2 miles from Upminster tube (think it can be a little shorter if we cut through some fields). I'll post the directions PDF and registration forms when I get home.

This thread will be to provide information to help coordinate a trip and will be edited with more info as we get closer to the time.

Disclaimer : Most of this thread is shamelessly stolen from [/u/fross](http://www.reddit.com/user/fross)

**What?**

A daytrip to Brighton.

**When?**

Monday, 1st April. This is the bank holiday for Easter. Leaving in the morning, coming back at night. Or staying over if you want to.

**Why?**

r/LSC invaded [Brighton](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/r46f7/090412_easter_monday_rlsc_invades_brighton/) last year, so why not do it again (at least with the ones who haven't run away to sunny climes) Seaside, Icecream, Sunshine (this didn't happen last time), fun, drink and stuff. We did get amazing pictures of people being soaked in waves though.

**Who?**

Everyone is invited. Sign up below, and we'll coordinate getting everyone around.


**How?**

Transport: Train tickets will be REALLY CHEAP if you book soon. If you get a Super Off Peak Day Return, and buy it for 4 people with the Groupsave option, it's just £20, or £5 each roundtrip from London Bridge! I've checked, it is valid that day, but it has to be bought 2 weeks in advance, which gives you until the 17th to book them.

Tickets can be bought [here](http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/)

~~I've got 1 4-person ticket so far, so do let me know if you want to tag along on mine.~~ Booked 

**Itinerary**

I am going to suggest everyone going by train get the 10:57 train from London Bridge which gets in at 11:55. (I have confirmed the train times listed here are compatible with the cheap tickets) The groups of 4 do need to travel together, but if a whole group wants to take a later or earlier train, that should be fine.

•Arrive in Brighton about 12:00

•Go to the seafront, point at the strange big blue watery thing or get soaked in the rain.

•Find something to eat - either a restaurant (suggestions welcome), or if the weather is nice(it just might happen), picnic on the beach?

•After lunch, at about 2pm, I suggest we split up into groups to do different things people may want to do - more beach, go to the pier, go shopping in the Lanes, go to a pub (if the weather is awful). Aim to meet back at a particular place (TBA) at 5pm. brit_pop recommends wearing JELLIED EEEEELS on the beach and eating vintage clothes (mmm, that texture).

•At 5, relocate to a bar or pub, enjoy the sunset, have some food, and so on. 

•About 9pm, Get the train home. Again, people must travel in their 4s. I would recommend the 20:34 train to London Bridge getting in at 21:32. There are trains about every 20 minutes, but it is a work day the next day!

As a palestinian who has been smoking Shisha since he was 13, I HAD to search for a good place to smoke at. After checking Edgware Road and several others, I was really disappointed. Lucky me, the closest place to my home turned out to be the best :)

**Shisha Mrad No. 1**. This place reminds me more of the Shisha bars back at home. Good and cheap pipes (**10 pounds a pipe**, 7 pounds refill), people playing cards and dominos, mint tea... Oh, they don't serve alcohol.

It might seem a little scary, but I promise that you won't be disappointed by the pipes :)

We meet **at 8pm at Uxbridge Road X Old Oak Road**. It's in East Acton/Shepherds bush. [Here is a map](http://goo.gl/maps/Inidk)

If you are lost, call this number: **07746309888**
Anyone who arrives late can call me so I can pick him up at the entrance, unless you feel brave enough to search for us :)

If this event goes well, I might organize some other arabic-themed events in the future :)

Edit:
Make sure you eat something before. They don't serve food (just some chocolate bars) and its not advised to smoke on an empty stomach.
People who have never smoked before or aren't experienced are more than welcome! We will teach you...

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Hammersmith Hang Out is for you...

*Well, it is a year since I was looking for a way to meet new people in London, but realised I couldn't get to Shoreditch and back on a week night and so what I really needed was a meetup less than 10 mins stroll from my door...*

*And so, for nearly every Monday of the last year people have come to join me in a pub in Hammersmith for a few pints, a chat and maybe some food. I really had no idea the event would be quite so popular and continue anywhere near this long - and last week was the busiest ever (35ish people)!*

*The only thing which has really changed in the past year of the event was the name, the change from Hammersmith Drinks to Hammersmith Hang Out has had a great effect on encouraging more people to turn up - even though we were getting loads of LSC newbies before.*

*So, finally I want to say a huge* **THANKYOU** *to everyone who has come along and lets hope this keeps on going strong for another year!*

Another niche one from me:

Sci-Fi London showing a bunch of anime overnight next Saturday at the Stratford Picturehouse. Frankly, I'm not sure how I'll be able to stay awake so long, but hey!

Films being shown are:

* [Tiger and Bunny: The Beginning](http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13781) - Superheroes meet reality TV

* [Journey to Agartha - The Children Who Chase Lost Voices](http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=12141) - *""The story centers on Asuna, a girl who spends her solitary days listening to the mysterious music emanating from the crystal radio she received from her father as a memento. However, she embarks on a journey of adventure to meet a boy again, and thus comes to know the cruelty and beauty of the world, as well as loss.""*

* [Tales of Vesperia](http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10759) - *""A long time has passed since the end of a massive war between humans and monsters. A new type of energy named ""aer"" was discovered. When crystallized, this substance became the energy source for ""blastia"", an ancient civilization's technology that provided a wide array of essential abilities for humanity. Despite it's manipulation, mankind still has little knowledge of what exactly is ""aer"". On a mission to eradicate a horde of monsters near the town of Shizotania, a group of knights comes across a strange surge of ""aer"". Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo are two new members fresh out of the academy of this knight division. Both are childhood friends who went separate ways, but ended up meeting each other once again while enlisting to serve the Empire.""*

* [GYO](http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13361) - *""Okinawa is taken by an influx of disturbingly bizarre walking fishes that are leaving the ocean and are heading to the cities. Amid this freakish event, a girl named Kaori loses contact with her boyfriend Tadashi who lives in Tokyo. She heads to the capital to try to locate him only to find out that the metropolis has been taken over by the fish and their foul stench.""*
* [Gintama the Movie](http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11152) - *""The silver-haired samurai Sakata Gintoki investigates the disappearance of a legendary sword named Benizakura while his partners Kagura and Shimura Shinpachi try to find out what has happened to Gintoki's friend, Kotaro Katsura.""*

The only one of those films I've already heard of is the first, so I can't offer more advice than my copied-and-pasted synopses I'm afraid.

You choose your seat when you book your ticket, so I'll wait a day or two to see how many people show interest before I try to pick somewhere to sit. There's a few large blocks of seats available, so it shouldn't be a problem for us all to sit together.

1351843081.0,14,self.LondonSocialClub,12i7rv,[10/01/13] - Circle Line Pub Crawl 2.0 - 150th Anniversary Spectacular - Save The Date,beavershaw,14,0,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/12i7rv/100113_circle_line_pub_crawl_20_150th_anniversary/,"I've talked about organising a second circle line pub crawl for a long time now and have finally decided on a firm date. It will happen on Thursday January 10th, 2013 - the 150th anniversary of the Tube's opening. 

To add to the challenge I'm going to attempt to walk between each station myself. You're welcome to do it this way with me, but I will organise the pubs to visit if you'd prefer to take the tube (recommended option). 

The other major difference from the first time around is that I'm going to be raising money for Bowel Cancer UK (my charity of choice for my own personal tube walking). I'm going to ask that people make a £10 donation via My [JustGiving page](http://www.justgiving.com/randomlylondon) before they come along. I'm not going to make it a requirement, but the pub crawl is going to be pricey (around £40 if you do the whole thing). So if you can afford to do it, I think it's fair I ask for a charitable donation. 

Only 4 LSCers have ever completed the whole thing, and 3 of them are still in London. Will anyone else join them? Please put your names down below if interested. 

**FAQ**

Why is this held on a Thursday and not a Saturday?

The circle goes through large sections of the City where pubs are closed on the weekend. Plus, the Tube's 150th anniversary happens to be on a Thursday. 

Where will it start/end?

Since I'm organising it's going to start and end in South Ken. Start time will be 11am sharp as that's when the first local pub opens.

What is the Circle line pub crawl? 

You can see what we did [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/f8x3o/friday_march_4_reddit_circle_line_pub_crawl/). However, pubs, times and order will be slightly different this time. 

**Edit 1:** As I thought, the Thursday thing seems to be somewhat of an issue. I'm happy to do it on Friday (Sat. and Sun will not work), but Brad is 100% correct it makes completing the whole thing that much more difficult. That said we did it before on a Friday and finished just fine. So please let me know if you'd prefer Friday Jan 11th or be true to form and have it on the actual 150th anniversary (Thursday Jan 10).

Unfortunately our hand has been forced and we are no longer able to continue with the event as planned tomorrow.

Matters out of our control has meant that we cannot use the site.

Hi, LSC!  

Some of you might remember me as the odd fella from Secret Cinema handing out comps here every now and then, some of you might not.  

I bumped into [Project X](http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/xbg4n/partycrashing_an_empty_festival_site_my_company/) here not long ago and checked it out with Jess (joosicat3).  

We not only found out that this beautiful site was barely in use at all during the Olympics (due to some logistics nightmare or something), but also that it would be available for some days...  

Me and a few others sprung into action and decided to put on a **free** mini festival there this coming Saturday, since it's a bloody shame to let a good space like this go unused.  

Every artist, performer and organiser is doing this pro bono, simply for the love of it (and mostly because we can?).   

As I've suggested in [The Great British Beer Festival thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/xi1b4/110812_the_great_british_beer_festival_olympia/), this might be an idea to visit after the (moderate‽) soaking.  

Stay awesome,  
Raggi.

*ninja edit* We're still open to more acts, if you or anyone you know has an act (musical, performative, artwork - anything?) that you'd like to share with London.

'I've been promising a few people I'd get this posted.. 

[The Great British Beer Festival](http://gbbf.org.uk/) is a yearly event featuring lots of real ales, ciders, some fruit wines, some old-school pub games and good food (Boar/Ostrich burgers for example).

I've been to the last 2 at Earls Court, unlike the smaller festivals there is usually a decent range of beer on the last day - I've been able to try the festival winner both times. If we meet early we should be able to nab a table which is very useful.

Event runs 11am-7pm on the Saturday, we could head somewhere after. We'll be plastered though.

Tickets are £8, £6 for CAMRA members - if you're thinking of joining CAMRA I'd recommend doing so inside the festival for extras. Beers are usually very reasonably priced, the strong foreign ones will be a bit costly.

You can bring your own pint glass, or place a deposit on an event one when there (which you can keep) - beers are served in pints, 1/2s and 1/3s with no penalty on price for the smaller quantities - this allows you to try plenty of different beers and styles.

Non-beer drinkers are very welcome, I've been with some who usually enjoy trying the various fruit wines. There wont be much lager about, but the real beers are soo much better anyway. Well most of them.. there are always some shockers.

Any other questions, please ask!

[BEER!](http://i.imgur.com/BkI9w.jpg)'

Remember to get your tickets people, I'll also use this post to organise a meeting point/time on the day and give out my number to help everyone find us (could a mod redirect the sidebar?). 

I'll be aiming for getting there for opening to grab a table, which I'm hoping they have since the move from Earls Court. My non beer drinking GF will also be making an appearance, in case there are other non-beer drinkers who want wine/cider drinking company.

A tip with the tickets - usually they're 'print your own', if it is like previous years you only have one chance to print - so print to PDF in case of printer failure.

**there should be tickets on the door for the lazy, might be a spare below if you're lucky too.**

**I'm not sure how many of the original repliers are still coming.. I'll be somewhere near the entrance  to Olympia (I'll try to update where) from 10:45 ish, text/call me on the number below to meet up, I'm keen to grab a table at the start, more than 1 if I know many are coming**

We have tried numerous venues near Notting Hill, most are having either a £15 cover or a minimum age of between 23-30.  Stay tuned, we will find an all-welcoming cheap venue.

**What?**

A daytrip to Brighton.

**When?**

Monday, 9th April.  This is a bank holiday for Easter, if that had slipped past you.  Leaving in the morning, coming back at night.  Or staying over if you want to.

**Why?**

I need to go pick up some speakers, so seemed like a good opportunity to bring along 20 of my closest friends.  ;)  Seaside, Icecream, Sunshine (hopefully), fun, drink and stuff.  I want to fling a frisbee close enough to the water to have someone trip and get soaked (now watch me do just that)

**Who?**

Everyone is invited.  Both LSC people and some natives from [/r/Brighton](/r/Brighton) who will be joining us.  Sign up below, and we'll coordinate getting everyone around.

Londoners, be sure to bring some shiny marbles and card tricks so you can set yourself up there as a God.

So far, from London we have:

fross, ShetlandJames, Kaer, Lowercase\_drawer, Artificial\_Limey, miaoued, phenorbital, PoshNoob, jaymeekae (blessing the rains), arseoutofthemselves, UbikRubik, lyla\_, PortConflict, barc0de, artiomchi, muzzz, somabc, Mancalime, ruthmf, LordAnubis12, saltsman, osahp, goldensilverware, PlussOne, InsertRandomName, Xlevus.

And joining us from sunny Brighton:

haywire, cjdowner, alexdamage

**How?**

Transport: There is only one car going down now, and is full at the moment.  However, it looks like train tickets will be REALLY CHEAP if you book soon.  If you get a Super Off Peak Day Return, and buy it for 4 people with the Groupsave option, it's just £20, or £5 each roundtrip from London Bridge!  I've checked, it is valid that day, but I think you have to buy SO-PDRs 2 weeks in advance, which gives you until the 25th to book them.

Train groups (for the cheap tickets - think everyone will be on the same train anyway)

 - phenorbital - Lowercase\_drawer, Merendis, muzzz
 - Goldensilverware - InsertRandomName, Xlevus, Waywinkle
 - Artificial\_Limey - PlussOne, verbify, ouchpouch
 - ghettro - saiph, ClockworkPenguin, howling_moon


Needs ticket: ubikrubik, unknittable, yepiyep, arseoutofthemselves (maybe)


***Itinerary***

I am going to suggest everyone going by train get the **10:57 train from London Bridge** which gets in at 11:55.  (I have confirmed the train times listed here are compatible with the cheap tickets) The groups of 4 do need to travel together, but if a whole group wants to take a later or earlier train, that is of course fine.

 - Arrive in Brighton about 12:00
 - Go to the seafront, point at the strange big blue watery thing.
 - Find something to eat - either a restaurant (suggestions welcome), or if the weather is nice, picnic on the beach?
 - After lunch, at about 2pm, I suggest we split up into groups to do different things people may want to do - more beach, go to the pier, go shopping in the Lanes, go to a pub (if the weather is awful).  Aim to meet back at a particular place (TBA) at 5pm.  Artificial_Limey has also recommended a **""life-changing"" cup-cake store** at http://www.angelfoodbakery.co.uk/gallery.php
 - At 5, relocate to a bar or pub, enjoy the sunset, have some food, and so on.  TBA.  At this point I will also trundle off with Kaer to pick up my speakers then join you later!
 - About 9pm, Get the train home.  Again, people must travel in their 4s.  I would recommend the **20:34 train to London Bridge** getting in at 21:32.  There are trains about every 20 minutes, but it is a work day the next day! :(

I have an application form with me for [Only Connect](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lskhg), a quiz show on BBC 4 (Monday nights 20.30) based on finding connections between random things. I was meant to go with 2 IRLs, but they kinda lost enthu after a look at the application form. (they're just being lazy, IMHO :P) In the interest of full disclosure, I've put up the questions asked on the form over here: http://pastebin.com/Th6juczb

I was hoping two of you pub quizzing chaps would be interested enough to team up with me for this? Would be cool to have a team called ""Redditors"" or ""/r/LSC/""on there.

Only hitch is, the **deadline for applying is midnight tonight**, and we'd have to sort out a little preliminary test that's in the application form as well, before then.

**Important dates**:

* Application deadline: 31st January, 2012 (**tonight!**)
* Auditions, if selected: between **9th – 12th** and **17th – 19th February**
* Shoot dates, if auditions are successful: **25th, 26th, 27th March** and the **1st, 2nd and 3rd April** in Cardiff

The only real condition on the form is that the contest is only open to U.K. residents aged 18 years old or over.

So if anyone's game, please orangered me! I'll send across the form and we can get cracking on filling it out.

Cheers,
shrik

p.s: not sure if I should've mentioned this, but there's no [monetary] cost involved. Other than travel to the location of the events. Or the alcohol imbibation during prep.

p.p.s: the show is hosted by [Victoria Coren](http://www.victoriacoren.com/).

It's been one week since I left beautiful London, with its mild temperatures and wonderful transit system (mild sarcasm here, since public transit doesn't even exist here in Montgomery, Alabama, so even tube strikes are better than no tube). I've been braving the 90+ degree weather every day (roughly 34 degrees C) and dreaming of summer showers and wind, real wind that doesn't feel like the air that shoots out of your oven when you open it. I've been waking up at 5:30 AM and passing the fuck out at 10:30 PM, and I am not amused, and I know this is all your faults.

Still, as I sit in the bar my friend works in and sip a delicious 5 dollar/3 pound craft brew (cheap!), I still miss you all, and the constant hustlebustle of London, and zoo lates and Sam Smith's pub crawls and Stux telling me I've been in London too long as I chew on a huge plate of burnt ends. 

I mentioned before to various people while I was drunk and probably at a Sam Smith's that London and London Social Club seemed to be very much a ""right here, right now"" kind of deal. So many people are not actually English, much less Londoners, and so people will rotate in and out. People go back to Canada. Massachusetts college boys disappear in the night. princessbunny gets deported to South Africa unless she gets a job. heresyourhardware and nonexcludable get sent back to Ireland, those paddy bastards. 

I'm glad I was there when LSC was so vibrant, accepting, and eventful. I worry that if I ever come back it'll be after LSC has jumped the shark, and that the core group of people are all moved on. I hope that doesn't happen and you guys stay ""real friends"", instead of just ""people from the internet"". 

You're all beautiful, wonderful people, even you foreveralone types, and I wish I had gotten to know you guys better while I was here. I'm glad I was a part of LSC right here, right now. You're all welcome in the south anytime. I'll go to New Orleans any weekend of the year. I'm going tomorrow actually, and you're all welcome to fill up the house we're renting.

Why meetup? Two reasons:

* 1) To stop troller's incessant whining. (I kid, I kid).
* 2) but mostly because I fucking love drum &amp; bass and I know a lot of you do too.

The night: [Shogun Audio @ Cable, SE1 - 18th June 2011](http://www.cable-london.com/event/we-fear-silence-present-shogun-audio3/18062011).

&gt;After another roadblock session back in April the line-up for the next batch of Cable carnage is here and it’s a D&amp;B Legend special that promises to be off the proverbial hook! Just take a look for yourself…. 

&gt;The names speak for themselves; Shogun soldiers Friction (2 hours), Alix Perez, Icicle, Rockwell and The Prototypes are joined in Room 1 by some very special guests including the godfather of drum &amp; bass, the legendary Fabio who’ll be rolling out as only he knows how with his 20 years experience in full flow. Add to this a very special back2back session featuring three of Bristol’s finest; Krust, Die and Dynamite MC! Dropping some classic Full Cycle and Clear Skyz bounders will be the order of the evening so do not miss this! Rewinds aplenty no doubt! 

Flyers for the night are here. [1](http://i556.photobucket.com/albums/ss2/shogunaudio/A5SGNCABLEJUNE11FX-2.jpg), [2](http://i556.photobucket.com/albums/ss2/shogunaudio/A3-SGN-STN-JUNE-2011X-2.jpg).

Just in case: don't expect Chase &amp; Status and/or Pendulum all night. There might be some and you should **absolutely definitely come anyway** but I don't think it's that kind of night. Expect stuff like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCYFs5AXq98), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOYEca7BSfM), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USpx9nDZhVQ), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMVLB5R0B-g_), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlU3maFbMyw&amp;feature=related), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T_mp50o86M), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo3ZaUqM2ik&amp;feature=related), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohQoJeR6vAA) and [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjZCm5oYT8k).

**Contact:** You can get hold of me, Andy, if you need to on [redacted]


**Notes:**    
This event is bring your own booze. I'm going to have some of the usual beer, cider, wine and spirits, but if you want anything extra special, please bring it along.    
Also remember, this *is* a a hotel. We can be pretty loud, but if/when you're leaving please bare in mind there may be some people sleeping as you walk out of the place. Be as loud as you want when you're out of the building - just be courteous inside. I'm sure you will!    
Liverpool Street is right on the doorstep of Brick Lane, so there's food and bars around the corner if you need it. There's a Tesco Express 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and of course, Liverpool Street Station over the road should you need to escape for any reason. There's even a McDonalds should you have a desperate craving for a double cheeseburger or McFlurry.

Some murmurings about heading back to the Latymers, but I think we'll give the Queens Head at least another week.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few who will eat there, the food is standard pub grub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

If you're coming from the station it'd be a bit faster to walk down Shepherds Bush Road and then enter brook green on the right rather than the normal route to Latymers down Hammersmith road and entering brook green on the left.

We'll be out back in the beer garden, I'll try to update this on the day with where in the garden.

Actually bring any oven-cooked goods you like, as long as they are home made and you are willing to share. There will be a baking competition with several categories (see below) and possibly prizes if I am so inclined. But generally the prize of eating lots of cake and having a few pints with your friends should be a pretty good reward.
If you do not bring Cake, I may require that you have a Death of my choosing, which will probably be sourced from the abandoned recesses of my liquor cabinet.

We'll probably tidy up and go to Pride in Soho afterwards.

**Where:**
The King Charles I, a little old pub just around the corner from King's Cross at 55 Northdown St [Google Map](http://goo.gl/maps/NppFB)

**When:**

* Pub Opens for us at 2pm. 
* Competition tasting from 3-4pm. 
* Prize giving sometime before 5pm. 
* Pub opens to public at 6ish.


**Rules:**

* The pub is rather cosy, with seating about 30 people indoors - everyone is welcome, cake or not.
* There is no kitchen, nor facility to heat things. I'll bring paper plates/towels/black sacks and a few knives. Anything else you need for your comestibles is up to you.
* If you desperately need somewhere local to finalise things then I might permit a bit of kitchen space in my house around the corner.
* Please bring a label for your cake with your name on it, and preferably warning about ingredients like booze/nuts/bacon that people might need to avoid.

Hammersmith Hang Out is for you...

I'm caving in to the pressure and moving this to a pub around the corner. Hopefully it'll be warm enough for us to enjoy the beer garden it offers.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

If you're coming from the station it'd be a bit faster to walk down Shepherds Bush Road and then enter brook green on the right rather than the normal route to Latymers down Hammersmith road and entering brook green on the left.

There is also a pub quiz on in the pub Monday nights, I think we'll be able to sit in the restaurant section towards the back to avoid interrupting it when it gets too cold to stay outside.

We'll be out back in the beer garden, I'll try to update this on the day with where in the garden.



I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me. I might also be late this week.

Not many people arrive early, so if you do, you get to play *a lot*. (I played about 12 songs last time).

So as waveygraveyplay has posted his [March 1 mini pub crawl](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/187o68/01032013_birthday_mini_crawl_covent_garden/), I thought it high time to invite everyone to save the date for our March 2 crawl!

The inspiration for this crawl is that the [Thames Clippers](http://www.thamesclippers.com/) serve alcohol, and at pretty reasonable prices too. Take in the glorious sights from Greenwich to Embankment via the Tower of London WHILE DRINKING? I think so.

****

**NOON**
We will begin at noon at the [Trafalgar Tavern](http://www.trafalgartavern.co.uk/), warming up and setting the mood. They open at noon so we should be able to get seats right above the Thames. The views are really glorious but apparently **THE FOOD IS SHIT SO WAIT UNTIL 2 TO EAT** because the next pub has FANTASTIC food.


To get here, exit Cutty Sark station (20 mins by DLR from Bank), get to the river, and walk east 8 minutes, past the ferries. If you feel like it, pick up your ticket for the **1643** Thames Clipper to London.

****

**2pm**
[The Gipsy Moth](http://www.thegipsymothgreenwich.co.uk/) is a 10 second walk from the Cutty Sark, which will inspire us to put on our sea legs(?). They have a lovely beer garden and personally I feel it's one of the best pubs I've even been to. **This is food time**, the food here is excellent, and will prepare us for the journey.


As we're less than a 5 min walk from the ferry tickets, I **strongly suggest** people wander off in small groups to get tickets for the 1643 Thames Clipper service. We don't want to show up with a queue of 50 10 mins before departure, right? And if it's sunny the boats do occasionally get full (though rarely in March). Go get your tickets, come back and drink more.

****

**425pm**
We embark on a voyage of bravery and sightseeing! We head to the Thames Clippers.

**443pm**
WE'RE ON A BOAT!!! A 35 minute ride with drinks, swashbuckling, and disturbing nonparticipants.

****

**520pm**

TATTERSHALL CASTLE Embankment.

****

**730pm**
We load into the Northern line at Embankment and head to Camden to queue at [KOKO](http://www.koko.uk.com/). The queue at 8-9 is almost nothing, it'll be empty initially but there'll be like 50 of us. Once near KOKO we can head to a cheap pub or offie for half an hour.

****

**930pm**
[Buttoned Down Disco](http://www.buttoneddowndisco.com/) at KOKO. It is free before 10 but there is a queue so we have to get there early. I will print a zillion invites so we can all go free.

****

This is the approximate itinerary, obviously I'm still working on the last few pubs.

THIS IS ENGLAND so we are going rain or shine. Probably rain. The boats are covered though, anyway.

I am organising this to celebrate my birthday, so I will request river-themed outfits. Sailors (ideally like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F2lk9OhcOkU/S_FKk9ReMnI/AAAAAAAAACA/ws4L4m6lSCc/s1600/vintage+gay+sailors.jpg)), mermaids, pirates, parrots, etc. NOT NECESSARY so don't let it scare you but I like a good bit of dressing up fun.

Sign up here if you like, or just show up at any point in the day. 

For those concerned! A thames clipper ticket is 6 quid, 5.40 with oyster card, 4 quid if you have a travelcard (I think). SWEET DEAL. And if you drunkenly miss the boat, there's another 20mins later, so no worries. But drinking alone on a boat's just not the same.

One of the things I want to start there are fortnightly (?) board game evenings - and what better way to test things out than with redditors?

The shop is open on Saturdays until 5.30 PM, but I'll need some time to do the paperwork and prepare the place, so I'd rather start at 6.30. There are two large tables and 7 or 8 chairs, but I'll try to get a couple more in.

I can provide tea &amp; coffee as well as some board games to start off (heavily expanded Munchkin set, San Juan, Pandemic, Settlers of Catan), and I'll be happy if people bring in their own stuff. Obviously you'd be able to browse/buy the books etc. as well.

Hello r/LondonSocialClub!





**What is LondonFootballMeetup?**


Group of people who meetup to play football EVERY SINGLE SUNDAY, [whatever the weather.](http://imgur.com/a/vWBsg)  Our home is: http://www.reddit.com/r/londonfootballmeetup

**Where do we play?**


We play in Hyde Park, [HERE](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=207627779850726004772.0004d3d52e8f5207eecb0&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.503774,-0.161233&amp;spn=0.016081,0.038581) to be exact.


**Where do we meet?**


Outside [Hyde Park Corner Station](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=207627779850726004772.0004d3d52e8f5207eecb0&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.503774,-0.161233&amp;spn=0.016081,0.038581), next to Wellington Arch, very close to where the Queen lives.

**Who can come along?**

EVERYONE IS WELCOME, any sex, skill level, age, absolutely anyone can play with us, and if they dont feel like playing they are welcome to cheer, take pictures or referee.



**How much does it cost?**


Playing footy is ABSOLUTELY FREE! Some of us do sometimes go to the pub across the road to have a drink after the game, again all welcome.

**What kind of footy do we play?**


It varies! We have played from 11-a-side to 3-a-side, but 5/7-a-side seems to be the most preferred format.


**How do I book?**


No booking needed, but if you post below we will know how many people to expect

**Can I bring a friend?**


YES! the more the better!

Was a little quieter last week, but not by much! I hope all the newbies are enjoying the meet.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices (I think) and water.*

GIVING BLOOD is a non-drinking event, at least to begin with (and not recommended straight afterwards)

 *** IMPORTANT NOTE: EVENING SLOTS ARE ALREADY GOING QUICKLY!! ***

---------

I'm booked in to give blood at 7pm in the evening and thought, since there's chatter about not doing all the drinking things - let's make it a thing.


**Here's the important part:**

There are currently only 8 evening slots left for that date, the day before (the 10th) is already almost fully booked, so if you want to be in - you'll need to call them and reserve the date very very soon, ie now if you're serious about doing a non-drinking LSC event ;-)

There are slots throughout the day also, so if you want you can pop in and then join us for the meal later. 
[BLOOD.CO.UK](https://secure.blood.co.uk/enrol.asp)

**0300 123 23 23**


 If you're already a donor, you'll need your ID (or at least your address etc), if you're not a donor yet you'll need to [ENROL](https://secure.blood.co.uk/enrol.asp) here.

Save a life! (etc)

You'll also have the opportunity to join the bone marrow registry, something I also recommend.

**THE FOOD SECTION**

""Iron-rich foods include spinach, red meat, fish, poultry, beans and raisins""


Afterwards we'll be going to [BODEANS](http://www.bodeansbbq.com), BBQ ribs etc on Poland Street (W1F 8PZ) -

If you'd be interested in creating a board game this month please come along and we can try and create and design a fun game, with the ultimate goal of getting it published.

**THE PLAN**  
[04/11/12] Initial meetup to discuss game mechanics, what we think makes a good game and thrash out some of our ideas.   
14:00 - 20:00+, [Penderels Oak](http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/penderels-oak)

*Agenda*  

* What games do we like?
* Why do we like them?
* Why makes games fun?
* What are some common archetypes?
* What are some mechanics to think about?
* How to create game art?
* Marketing ideas
* Publishing options

Contact on o77three2 o5three465

[11/11/12] Testing, discussion and assistance (if required).  
14:00 - 20:00+, [Penderels Oak](http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/penderels-oak)

*Agenda*  

* Demonstrations and discussions

Contact on o77three2 o5three465

[18/11/12] Sanity check. Make sure your game isn't terrible and that it can actually be played. I suggest everyone join the [Playtest Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Playtest/) and we get some people that know roughly what they're doing to help us out. However, if we want to keep it amongst ourselves that is fine too and I'll update with a location.

*Agenda*  

* Meet new people
* Play their games
* Play our games

Contact on o77three2 o5three465

*ORIGINAL POST*  
Board game meetups are always pretty popular but I'm sure there's things we think we could do better :D

Would anybody be interested in designing a board game at a meetup instead?

£50 gets us  

* 2,000 blank playing cards  
* 20 blank dice  
* 1,000 blank counters  
* 20 miscellaneous dice (4x D4, D8, D10, D12, D20)  
* 20 D6  
* Some Sharpies  
* Some blank card

Suggested Format:  
£10 in each, assuming we get 4 other people in, or whatever we work out we need for our games. 
We meet up on the 11th (or whenever) and dish out the equipment.  
Everybody goes home and makes a prototype and then we meet on the 18th to play-test. Split into groups of 4 or 5 (unless you make a 2 player game).  

Once we've tested everyone's game we pick one to develop further and see how far we can take it :)

Might be a silly idea, but I don't know until I ask, so would anybody be interested?

Finally, we’ll consider ways to prevent people from being exploited or harmed by such “designer drugs”.

We will be staying at the lovely [Debden House](http://www.debdenhouse.com/Campsite/Campsite.html) which is [right by](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ig10+2nz&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.65512,0.082612&amp;spn=0.021726,0.038581&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=21.27781,39.506836&amp;z=15) Epping Forest (with access to the forest from the camp site). We're there for just one night (though if a few of you wanted to stay for longer I doubt that would be a problem). And we'll be on the **firefield** so we get to ~~dance naked~~ *sit quietly and peacefully* around a camp fire.

Basic [price](http://www.debdenhouse.com/Campsite/CampingPrices.html) for rocking up with a tent is £7.50 (£6.50 if you're a Newham resident). I neglected to ask if that covers a car each, but I'll check that if anyone wants to drive. Otherwise factor in a short cab journey from Debden station, or a walk if you're into that sort of thing, and the cost of food and [drink](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfemtcSnehQ). I may well try to sort out a gazebo or two as well, so give me a shout if you have one handy (I have one myself, but depending on the weather and numbers we might want a couple).

I will be sorting out the payment a bit nearer the time, but if you want to pay me now that would be perfectly [excellent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtWnqBW26VI) (I will sort out a paypal/google checkout account tomorrow evening, and cash is of course acceptable).

Right, that's everything I can think of at the moment, but if you have any questions etc, please do ask.

Edit 1: Ok, this is a preliminary list so if you're a preliminary yes then that's a yes. I'll do a confirmation post nearer the time, I just want to make sure I've booked for the right sort of numbers.

Edit 2: Starting a list for my own benefit. If you've expressed any interest you're on it, but don't worry, it's no obligation at this point (although I may pout if you don't come)

FAQ

I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?

The majority of people who came along last week had never touched a game (spare the dreaded Monopoly). Come down, try it out and make some friends. Plus, you totally have beginner's luck on your side, which is excellent. Go for it!

I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones I'll be dominating this time?

Last week we had Cards Against Humanity, Fluxx, King of Tokyo, the Resistance and Settlers of Catan. This week I'm adding Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, the Games of Thrones Board Game. If you've got your own that you wish to crush us with (literally or figuratively), bring it along!

Do I need to bring in anything?

A few pounds/guineas/knuts/credits/groats for the barkeep to provide you with quenching ales, tonics and spirits.

Can I bring along some friends of mine?

The more the merrier. Literally. Bring as many as possible. Willing or not.

If you're coming, please do let us know in the comments. I'll PM remind you the evening before to give you a heads up.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

1351205662.0,9,self.LondonSocialClub,123ck5,[All of November] NaNoWriMo Write Ins - Ever wanted to write a novel? Now's the time!,jaymeekae,12,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/123ck5/all_of_november_nanowrimo_write_ins_ever_wanted/,"NaNoWriMo stands for National Novel Writing Month and takes place in November every year. The idea is that you write an entire novel JUST within the month of November. You can plan in advance (which is why I'm posting this now) but any actual writing must take place from 1-30th Nov. The goal is to reach 50,000 words. It works out at ~1667 words per day.     
             
I did it 2 years ago and even though I only hit 25k which technically is a failure, I still felt awesome about it.        
      
They have a pretty cool website with some awesome forums full of amazing advice, inspiration and encouragement [over here](http://www.nanowrimo.org/). One of the things people do is have ""write-ins"" where you take your laptop (or paper) along to a cafe or wherever and everyone sits and writes in unison. I went to one when I did nanowrimo and they had posted a schedule which was supposed to be like 45 mins writing, 15 mins break for chatting, but in the event, no one seemed to be running it, so the chat sessions/breaks never happened, so I figure why not just host our own lsc write-ins and try and make the breaks happen.        
    
Of course, nanowrimo means different things to different people but for me it's kind of an encouragement to just create something without constantly second guessing and worrying if it's good enough. It doesn't have to be good, it just has to be 50k words. I think there's something pretty zen about that. So don't worry if you've never written more than a shopping list before, just give it a shot! Also this'd be pretty cool for anyone new wanting to meet people at quieter events that don't involve drinking :)       
       
I've mentioned nanowrimo to a couple of other people already and I knew there are a few people considering taking part so this is a call to arms for anyone else who wants to get involved to start planning! Then, if enough people get into it, we can post write ins throughout the month, maybe 1-2 a week.      
           
edit: also I've just thought, even if you dont want to commit to writing a whole novel, you could come along to write ins and write short stories!

Here is a rockaoke FAQ!    

**What is rockaoke? Is it karaoke but only rock songs?**      
No! Rockaoke is like karaoke but with a LIVE BAND!     
     
**Wow, that sounds amazing!**    
I know!     
       
**But how will I know what words to sing?**        
They have the words printed out!      

**But how will I know when to come in and stuff?**         
Well it does help if you know the song reasonably well but the band is there to help you out, they will do stuff like count you in and point at the words if you get lost.     
     
**What if I am not a very good singer?**      
Great! Even better! Just rock out more and no one will notice!     
          
**Do any of the band members have cats?**     
Yes!       

**I really would rather do this at The Richard Steele**     
Well i know, wouldn't we all. You could try starting a campaign of hatred against the local residents of belsize park but i doubt it will really help in the long run.        
         
**Is it ok to come if I am new/have never come to a lsc event before/have just arrived in town/am shy/don't like to sing/am a girl/only have one arm/am not really sure about all this?**        
Yes! Everyone is welcome except those underage or people who do not like fun.   
         
**I do not like fun.**        
Have you tried living in Belsize Park and writing letters to the council? It might be right up your street!   

**SHUT UP RAMBLING WHAT TIME DOES THIS HAPPEN?**
The band starts at 8 or something I guess I dont know, I guess i will be there a bit before that, probably by 7.30. Sadly there are no crack addicts to chat with but if memory serves from the last time i went to star of kings about a year ago you can while away the time having an argument with one of the bouncers or discussing whether they really should leave that table right in front of the stage, or if they dont do that any more, then you can congratulate them on their improved rockaoke event hosting skills.       
       
**WHERE?**       
~~The Richard Steele~~ NOPE! This is not at the richard steele *tear*... it's at [Star of Kings](http://www.starofkings.co.uk/)        
           
**HOW WILL I FIND YOU?**

Unfortunately only one person paid the deposit on time, so I lost the 20 reservations we had for the event. If you want to come along it's worth contacting them, and I believe they allow for a limited number of walk-ons, but it is now probably fully booked.

**/Edit**

First And Only Airsoft do open days for the public on Sundays, and there's one on the 5th August.  

It's open to any skill level; you don't have to be a pro airsofter or paintballer, and frankly it's just a bloody good excuse to shoot each other.

The Mall is an abandoned (but hooked up, power, etc) 250,000 square foot shopping mall near the train station. Where else can you get the chance to (legally) launch an assault on C&amp;A up the escalators?

[Event link](http://www.firstandonlyevents.co.uk/ai1ec_event/open-day-the-mall-reading-34/?instance_id=672) - [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV_iID2O2vQ)  

There are multiple hire packages ranging from £55 to £95, and if you have your own gear you can play for £36. Some of the packages come with thunderflashes and thermobaric grenades, if that's your thing.

Return train from London Paddington is around £16, and it's 30 minutes each way (and a 5 min walk at the other end).

The safety briefing is at 0930, and there's a train that leaves Paddington at 0830 to arrive just after 9.  

The guy I spoke to said the events tend to fill up at least 3 weeks in advance (there are usually around 80 players) so it'd be good to book early.  

Any takers?  
  
**Edit**

I've spoken to F&amp;O and we have 20 confirmed reservations.. we can get more but I think they want a few of us to actually book so far. In addition, as more than 5 of our group are planning to hire weapons/gear/etc, **they would like a £10 deposit per person, payable with PayPal** (eugh). For those who have signed up as per the list below, can you **please arrange to pay this** to their PayPal address firstandonlyreading@hotmail.co.uk (you can confirm I'm not making this up; it's listed on [their website](http://www.firstandonlyevents.co.uk/venues/the-mall/)). 

I've opted not to collect money myself as it seems easier + quicker to let everyone book themselves, but please do so soon. You need to include your name, the game date (Sunday 5th August), your contact details, which package type you would like, and if you're vegitarian. Please state that you're paying a deposit on your hire with the remainder to be paid later, and that you're with the 'LondonSocialClub' group. Or you can just pay the full price now.

Please let me know when you've either paid a deposit or fully paid so I can update the list below and know if we need more spaces reserved. Thanks!

*EDIT EDIT: In a dictatorial move I have made a decision that I WILL enforce: Cards Against Humanity games can be played by a MAXIMUM of 6 players at a time, and will be played to a maximum of ten points (black cards) and then restarted to allow other players in. Otherwise it becomes the easy drunk game that everyone gets in on and there are definitely diminishing returns, and it makes seating awkward, so fucking deal with it.*

1336826549.0,12,self.LondonSocialClub,tjky4,[30/06/12]  LSC bake off @ To be Determined,Kaer,12,0,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/tjky4/300612_lsc_bake_off_to_be_determined/,"Been a bit of chat about this, time to throw it out to the masses.

This may be a bit of blather, but need some feedback.  And rough idea of numbers.

Basically a baking and perhaps cook off challenge.  Cakes, cupcakes, cinnamon rolls.  Anything goes.

Baking is much easier as it does not require us to have access to a kitchen.

So there are a few options:

* We take over a pub/room
* We attempt to do an outdoor event
* We hire a kitchen - can both cook on day (bonus points) or bring in pre-baked goods.
* Someone offers up their house for 40+ ppl.

The list of quotes I've got for venues are as follows:

* http://www.cookeryschool.co.uk/, Old Portland Street.  £2000 for 4 hours
* Underground cookery school, http://www.undergroundcookeryschool.com/, Old Street, £1000 for 4 hours
* A Commercial Kitchen in battersea, £500 all day (6am - 8pm)
* West London University Kitchen, £250 for 4 hours.  
* Dephna commercial Kitchens, Park Royal (middle of no-where).  £100 for 4 hours.
* Scotch Malt Whisky Society Tasting Rooms, Farringdon.  About £100 (normally £250 - or perhaps for free, I need to confirm - I think they will give it to me for free based on the amount of business I give them + whisky I buy.  Joe said they'd sort out a sweet deal for me from my drunken convo with him on friday night)

I've also got a lead on a cafe that shuts on the weekend that we may be able to use for cheap.  But I will only get confirmation on that in a fortnight.  But at the moment I'm planning to go with SMWS.  It's the private room with about half a dozen tables and can easily hold 40 people.  No beers on tap, but nice bottled beers and wine.  Plus great whisky.  19 Greville Street  London, Greater London EC1N 8SQ

No kitchen, so goods will need to be brought ready-to-eat.

Assume we'll start at 4pm.  Judging starts at 6pm.  Once judges have tasted the work and marked, any other attendees may taste remainders (including non bakers).  Around 8pm we'll head off to the pub or out into town depending on what you wish to do :)

The following is myself throwing out ideas:

In order to cover costs and award some prizes.  If you wish to be a judge, there will be a £20 entrance fee.  Maximum of 5 judges.  (This will be dependent on how cheap I can get a venue)

If you are attending and not bring home cooked baked goods, £5 entry.

If you are attending to compete and bringing baked goods, free.

Which means there will be prize money awarded to first, second and third.  And maybe another couple of categories.  Plus I'll get some trophies done up:

http://www.trophystore.co.uk/Images/Dynamic/Cache/Products/a902b_cm-scale_w-800_h-600_q-80_wm-800x600watermark2.jpg

You don't have to cook for the masses, I've got a feeling there will be about a dozen bakers, and same eaters.  We can quarter up cupcakes etc.  But once we've got rough numbers more details will follow.

Anyway, enough me blathering, ideas/comments/etc?  Better venue suggestions also appreciated.  I've got 1.5 months to sort it out, so shall be fine tuned, but keep the date free if you wish to bake/eat.

The quiz starts somewhat after 8pm, though people tend to arrive for pre-game from 6.45.  

The price: ~~your soul~~ £2.  

For this meagre cost you will gain a share of the Top Prize (which we will most assuredly win), or perhaps a share of wine (which we may *choose* to win instead).

You can drink beer and stroll around the exhibits like a flute, or get your education on, and food and drink is open throughout the night. Most LSC people will tell you, its a great way to spend a evening.

Is anyone interested in learning? I know how much work it was for me to learn everything by myself when I first got started and figured I'd share back some of my knowledge.

If there's any interest I'll post my brewing schedule (normally every other Saturday or Sunday).

There will of course be ample opportunity to sample previous brews (the best part of brewing is the waiting for the next stage)...

Am based in South London (SE25, nearest station is Norwood Junction, it's a 5 minute walk from there).

Next brews are likely to be a Russian Imperial Stout and/or an IPA, may do two on one day.

They bring a few telescopes (and if you have one, bring your own) for looking at stars and chatting about Astronomy.  I haven't been before but it has been recommended to me.  If it sucks, you can blame me.  There is zero cost for attending.  
 
http://bakerstreetastro.org.uk/

EDIT:  Update, starting at 6pm, to coincide with Stargazing LIVE with Professor Brian Cox and Dara O’Briain.  So I'll aim to be there by at least 6:30pm.

If the weather really, really sucks, I'll pull the plug.  But some clouds I'm still going.  

The only gate open is the Monkey Gate at the North of Regent Park.   Here's some much better instructions on how to get there.  

http://bakerstreetastro.org.uk/info/location/

From the e-mail I just got from them.

&gt; And as if that wasn’t enough, it also seems like we’ve been hit by the giveaway bug because, despite being absolutely free to join and free to attend all our meetings, we’ll be giving away yet another telescope with accessories to one lucky prize-draw-winner on 18th January, courtesy of the Widescreen Centre and the British Astronomical Association. 

&gt; On the 18th there will be no less than three planets for you to observe, with Venus in the west until just after 7pm, Mars rising in the east around 9.30pm and resplendent Jupiter visible until midnight (with it’s Great Red Spot on display after 9pm). But if you don’t know your Cassiopeia from your Capella, don’t worry: we have plenty of friendly people who’ll be happy to give you a tour of the constellations, point out bright stars and planets and show you the deep sky wonders such as the Orion Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy. I’ll be getting nice big images of Jupiter on a camera liveview screen and looking forward to seeing the beautiful yellow and blue double star Almach.

&gt; The skies will already be dark at 6pm as we start setting up the telescope deck at The Hub - so please do wrap up warm and consider bringing plenty of clothing layers to keep the winter chill at bay. Although there are pathway lights from Monkey Gate to The Hub (see map), bringing a torch would be advisable – preferably red light torches, if you have them. Also the café will remain open most of the evening so people will be able to escape the cold and buy warm drinks and food.

For those that don't know, I'm doing my Masters of Science in Astronomy for fun part-time.  If you ask me about specific stars I rely on Google Sky but I can rabbit on for hours about star, planet, galaxy formation and all the geeky astrophysics stuff :)

Anyway, name is Brad, mobile is 0 double 7 603897 double 6.    And if anyone is worried about walking through a dark park by themselves, ping me when you get there and I'll come get you at the gate.

If you don't know what I look like, as I'm coming straight from work, I'll be in my motorcycle leathers.  Here's a pic of me in them (don't get too excited boys) - http://i.imgur.com/D5Y4P.jpg  

Aussie flag patch on the left shoulder.  So if you can't spot a 6 foot tall, large, brown guy with a shaved head in leathers, you really are blind :)

Checked the weather forecast, it might be raining a little, I'm still going to head down to talk stars with other Astronomy geeks.  But use your own best judgement in regards to the weather.

Also, it seems like the best idea is to go in, in small groups as they can be seated faster (also why an early start time was picked). This means later arrival times may be possible, however given how busy the place is supposed to be, you will likely face a long queue. If someone is willing to meat people later that works for me, but they will have to provide a contact number.

Because somabc really want to sit on Santa's lap, come celebrate Christmas before Christmas with us! 

The plan is a nice Sunday roast followed by [Hyde Park Winter Wonderland](http://www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/) with Christmas markets, ice rink, rides, bars and all sorts of things. 


**When**: Sunday the 4th of December. Lunch at noon, Winter Wonderland afterwards (open until 10pm)

**Where**: Roast lunch at [The Prince Regent](http://www.theprinceregentw1.co.uk/) at 12pm - area reserved under Rosa. Address is 71 Marylebone High Street, London, W1U 5JN. Close to Baker Street, Great Portland St and Regent's Park tube.

**How much**: Winter Wonderland is free entry, [ride prices vary](http://www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/tickets). Pub roast is £9-15 for roast + trimmings.

**DRESS CODE SUGGESTION: CHRISTMAS JUMPERS ALL THE WAY!** Or anything Christmassy/hipster if you feel like it. Think Ironic/Ugly jumpers party. 
somabc really really *reaaaally* encourages you to wear red trousers too. 
This way we could take lovely group pictures with Santa and cherish them forever.

I haven't been on one for a while and would love to see if my 'snow legs' still work.  

**Date** - First thought is after Christmas, the snow is better and if we time it right we could take it during the off-peak time to get a better price

**Duration** - We could either do a full on week or maybe a long weekend

**Location** - I have no idea, and would welcome any input, (Europe)

**Cost** - It really does depend, but for travel, accommodation, lift pass, equipment hire and food and drink, I'd imagine anywhere up from £1000 (it's been a while since I've been and this is only a guess)

One option that I'd like to try is the train, there was a route from London on the Channel Tunnel which gave you an evening in Paris then an overnight 'sleeper' train to the mountains; you'd arrive around 6/7 in the morning, check in to the hotel and then hit the slopes.  

I have 3 weeks experience snow boarding almost 10 years ago, and that's it.  Don't worry if you've never been before and are as green as a British lawn, this holiday would be for all levels.

I have had a quick look through a few brochures and online, there are some cheap deals out there, I'll continue looking and see if I can put together a few packages and options so that we can decide what, when, how much, etc.  

My top choice (price considering), would be to get a chalet all to ourselves, catered and within crawling distance of the slopes.  I have no idea of the costs.  If someone has done this before for a group, any help/tips/costs would be brilliant.

In the future (when this post has sunk to the briny depths), I'll post again to LSC and PM you all as well.  Continue commenting for the time being and if you know others (redditors or not) that would like to come let me know.

The date is rapidly approaching so it's time to get this organised.

For those who didn't see the original post/can't remember:

We'll be staying at [Debden House](http://www.debdenhouse.com/Campsite/Campsite.html) which is conveniently [located](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ig10+2nz&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.65512,0.082612&amp;spn=0.021726,0.038581&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=21.27781,39.506836&amp;z=15) right on the edge of Epping Forest (with access to the forest from the site) and close to Debden tube (central line, which thankfully has no planned engineering works for that weekend). We will be staying on their firefield, so we'll be able to have a campfire and possibly barbecue*.

Detailed [prices](http://www.debdenhouse.com/Campsite/CampingPrices.html) are available on the website, but for just showing up with a tent for the night it is the very reasonable price of **£7.50**. We pay on the day, but they've asked if we can pay as one or two groups rather than individually: I will organise this next week when I have an idea of who's coming. If you want to stay on the site for more than one night, I'm happy to help with getting that arranged. We can be on site from midday onwards (and have to vacate by the following midday) so we can have a good afternoon of walking in the forest/playing games/whatever you want to do.

You will need to bring your own drink and food (I will update if/when I manage to arrange a barbecue). I'm currently trying to sort out a monstrous load of marshmallows for everyone as well, but if you want to make 'smores' or other crazy things, you'll need to bring the other bits yourself. 

If anyone wants to drive to the site, can you please give me a heads up: they'll let us have some cars on site for free, but couldn't tell me how many when I spoke to them yesterday.

We already have a gazebo (possibly 2) but if you want to bring anything else in that vein, it might be useful to mention it to me so that I can coordinate.

*Does anyone have a barbecue that they're happy to bring? (We can work out a way to get it there and back safely) I have just remembered the concept of disposable barbecues, so that's a possibly preferable alternative.

**Does anyone have a spare tent they don't mind being used by a fellow redditor?** Also, you can often find [cheap tents](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001S45ODU) online on various sites, as well as occasionally in Tescos and places like that.

* Meeting point: **The Prince of Wales pub** (91 Wilton Road, London, SW1V 1DW) just on corner near restaurant. I'll be there from 6.45pm.

* Dinner is at **Rodizio Preto (72 Wilton Road, SW1V 1DE**), table booked from** 7.45pm**


* Price per head for all-you-can-eat is £19.95, drinks not included. If possible bring cash to avoid splitting a bill over 15+cards. :P



* If you're confirmed but can no longer go, let me know so I can amend booking. 

* My number is 07804 924738 if you need to get in touch!

Decent examples of either are difficult to come by in London, but the two best places happen to be right down the street from each other in Notting Hill.

7:00-8:30: Tacos and burritos at [Santo Village](http://www.santovillage.com/) W10 5TD. Proper small-tortilla corn tacos with barbacoa, carnitas, nopales, birria, and other meats that Chipotle have never heard of.

8:30-late: Excellent cocktail, boring tiki lecture at [Trailer Happiness](http://trailerhappiness.com/). More of a retro 60s California bar than a tiki bar, but they make the best Mai Tai or Zombie inside the M25.

Please RSVP for the tacos, as Santo requires £10 p/p reservation for groups of 6 or more. I can cover the deposit but do not burn me punk or I will cut you. (They also do walk-ins for redditors without reservations, and Tuesday shouldn't be too busy.)

**Update:** For a single large group, Santo only does a taco set menu for £20/person. I'm making sure it includes all the meats. If you *don't* want to do this I can leave you off the group reservation. (You're still welcome to show up separately or book your own table.)

**Update 2: Some folks are concerned about the cost. I'm reserving a table for 8 with the set menu, which we can expand if need be. Redditors who *don't* want to be in on that can get their own table, fend for themselves, and we'll all meet up later at Trailer happiness.**

If the date doesn't work for lots of people then we can change it, but it seems like the best thing is to just pick one and go from there. Apologies for the delay in choosing a date - I've been in the process of moving flat and we all know how time-consuming/painful that is.

ANYWAY: Post in this thread if you can/can't make it and I'll edit this post for a roll-call. Once we have enough people, we'll assemble teams, and post a central meeting location. You'll get your list of items on the day, so don't worry about that. Each team will need a camera or a mobile phone with a camera, for proof of finding items.

Let the grand rumpus begin!

The lovely people at Horizon Paintball have also said that as we're bringing so many, they will **match the Groupon deal for any more who join us**, so if you didn't get a ticket, you can STILL get the equipment, gun and 100 paintballs for £3 offer!  

If we get 40 people (count on the last post was 37) we get the ground entirely to ourselves, it can fit somewhere up to the low 50s, so there is still plenty of room to sign up!  We also get the ground **for the full day** that's 9:15 to 16:30!  I doubt lunch is included I'll find out.

I will run the poll until Monday, at which point I'll announce the results and we can have a final place-booking thread for the selected date.

**EDIT**

   **PLANS**

* People traveling by train meet at Paddington at 10:40
* Meet-up rest outside Oxford Train station at 12.
* Walk down high street for about 10 min. 
* Drop by the Missing Bean, catch up with Coldcell, have coffee 
* We can either have lunch first(Chiang Mai Kitchen or Burrito place around the corner) and then climb the tower or climb tower first.
* Continue down high street for another 5 min to Magdalen boat house (pick up water if you have not already done so)
* Check out Magdalen's Fellow Garden
* Begin punting :-). I’m guessing we will start around 1:30-2pm
* Finish punting :-(. Due to time we may only be punting for hour.  If we are having fun we may look at dropping some things from the itinerary and continue punting.
* Walk towards the Pitt Rivers Museum. 15 min walk.
* Wander around Museum for an hour. Most likely won’t see everything in this time
* Head towards Jericho street fair. 15 min walk.  
* Buy ice cream from G&amp;D's. Meet alexn
* Enjoy fair
* Locate pub in Jericho.  Enjoy drinks. Guessing we get here around 5-6pm.

Itinerary ends at this point, but we have a list of good places to try and hopefully we have picked up enough locals by this stage so we should be sorted. 

Will plan on dropping by the cellar and catch up with some other redditors. Other than that we will just wing it until we drop. 

Trains run until midnight, buses run until 3am.  

I have dropped the bike rental as it made a few things awkward

I'm concerned that after the epicness of Pub Crawl VIII, we're in danger of having to risk jail sentences or hospital downtime if we want to top the previous standards set by you fine people. With that in mind, here's an idea that's potentially as fun and/or competitive as the bowling on Saturday, but perhaps less physically endangering.

I propose the following:

 * We, the good people of LSC, submit ideas below for items to locate in a London Scavenger Hunt, based around photos (as opposed to buying/collecting things). Examples could be: a photo of your team in front of the London Stone, a picture of your team on a boat on the Thames, proof of your team eating at a traditional fish &amp; chip shop, a photo of someone from your team with a real Pearly King.

 * Everyone else up/down votes these suggestions and we pick off the best 20 or so. We then pick a date (ideally a weekend/bank holiday) and divide into teams (maybe 5 or so people each but depends on numbers).

 * The first team back to the Princess Louise (of course) with all of their items wins. 

**But wait, there's more!**

 * **The team who manage to provide photo evidence of a reddit meme in action will win an arbitrary number of bonus points** as determined by the votes of the other teams. This could be you posing by a statue of a soldier and shouting ""AND MY AXE!"" or maybe you've photobombed some tourists with some F7U12 faces. Either way, creativity will be awarded.

 * After the winners and losers get their prizes, we have a good drink and celebrate/comiserate.

Who's in?! And who has ideas for the kind of things we could add to the scavenger list?

EDIT: jaymeekae raised some good questions/points:

- We should have a wide range of activities (say 50 items) with different points depending on the level of difficulty, so the objective could just be ""do all the high-point items"" rather than ""get the most individual items"". One caveat with this: let's keep things legal. If we start challenging people to get naked in the fountains at Trafalgar Square or whatever we're probably going to get into trouble.

- Teams should stay together and not split up to go and get items. This is a group task!",,False,,t5_2s87x,True,,THEIR,True,t3_hojlx,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/hojlx/ladies_gentlemen_of_lsc_i_present_the/,

The highlight of the museum is the [Colossus computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer) which is arguably the first computer ever made (the argument is down to definitions and semantics really).

The reason that I am deciding to organise this trip is not just because I think redditors would get a kick out of it but also because my Grandad was not only one of the lead engineers in building of the computer but he also rebuilt the current version that is in the museum from scratch.  I have not been to the museum since the exhibit was fully finished and as my Grandad died last year I think it would be a great opportunity to go and see it.

Depending on the amount of people interested I think I probably will be able to organise a relatively private/special tour but I haven't actually looked into this yes.

It will be an American mid-term sized swing from the [pub crawl for lazy people](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/ezjbr/saturday_12_february_the_pub_crawl_for_lazy_people/). Therefore, I give you the REDDIT (Really Extreme Drunken Debauchery Involving the Tube) Circle Line Pub Crawl.

I am posting it now to give people enough notice to take a day off work should they want to complete the whole thing from start to finish. Unfortunately, it can't be done at the weekend because a significant portion goes through the City, where pubs for some reason are closed on Saturday and Sunday.

Anyone is welcome to join this crawl. Also, feel free to join even if you don't plan on drinking or only plan on drinking at some of the pubs. For, those who want to attempt a drink at each pub it is strongly recommended that you stick to half pints or single shots. Keep in mind that we will not be staying at any pub very long, so order accordingly.  

On that note, people are also welcome to join the crawl part way through, but I can't guarantee where we will be at any given time. I have provided a rough estimate below, but please phone me to find out for sure (I'll post my number closer to the crawl). Finally, when confirming below can you mention whether or not you'll be at the start. I don't want to look like a total alcoholic so would prefer a few people to join right from the get go.

**When:** Friday March 4, 2011. 11:30am start time. 
**What you'll need:** An oyster card with at least £8 on it or a Zone 1 all day travel card. At least £50 if you plan on drinking at all pubs and getting a bite to eat. A strong liver (if drinking).
**Where:** Following the Circle Line clockwise starting at King's Cross. Here is a tentative list of pubs and times for each station.

1. 11:30am-12pm King's Cross - O'Neills
2. 12:10-12:25pm Farringdon -  3 Compasses

Since, moving to London I've had a great time doing extreme challenges (e.g. walking out to Epping) and drinking with fellow redditors. So why not combine the two? 

As far as I can tell there is nothing more extreme than the circle line pub crawl when it comes to drinking. And, I know from previous meetups there are a few fellow quasi-alcoholics like me on this sub-reddit.

We would need to start early (around 10am) and it would work best on a weekday (pubs in the City are usually closed on the weekend). I know this may exclude many people who have 9-5 jobs, but if given enough notice maybe you could take the day off. The cost would be no more £8 for the tube (I'm not planning on walking this one) for the day but will probably cost at least £50 for drinks and food. 

Of course like all meetups it would be open to everyone. People would be more than welcome to come along and drink at every pub (or even at all). Just keep in mind that the pace would have to be much faster than normal (less than 20 mins a pub).

Anybody interested?

**Edit:** Ok, seems like there is some interest in doing this so I will get started planning. I'm thinking the end of February, maybe Friday the 25th? If this is bad for anyone let me know (just keep in mind it pretty much has to be a weekday). As per cor_blimey's warning, I'll come up with a default pub for each stop, but I think we'll see where the day takes us.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few who will eat there, the food is standard pub grub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few who will eat there, the food is standard pub grub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

Space in the house for other games etc.

Spare beds for people if it gets late.

If you're not sure if you want to play or not, you're more than welcome to come along and watch / drink / play video games etc.

We'll hold a 30 minute session at the beginning for people who are new to the game or just want a refresher.

Probably start around 3/3:30 depending on what works out best for everyone.

**Transport:**

* Train to Norwood Junction (take the Woodside / Clifford Road exit) and then a 7 minute walk
* Train to East Croydon, then tram to ""Arena"" and a 4 minute walk
* There's ample parking on the forecourt opposite my house, but I wouldn't recommend driving unless you plan on staying over (what's the fun of poker without a few drinks?)

I'll message everyone with my address and number, but just in case of problems, my number is 07827-820-639

I'll provide a case or two of beer and there's coffee and tea on demand, but feel free to bring supplies.

I have 4 packs of decent cards, a shuffler and a full set of chips, but more chips might not be a bad idea if anyone wants to bring some.

If we get enough people we may have two tables, could even go tournament style depending on what people want.

[Rockaoke](http://www.rockaoke.co.uk/) are a live rock band that play a huge selection of contemporary and classic rock and pop hits - except you get to go up on stage and sing with them. If you dont want to sing its still a blast to dance along.

[Madame Jojos](http://www.madamejojos.com/cabaret/rockaoke/about/) is a cool little venue stuck right in the seediest bit of Soho. If you stick around after the gig you can catch the weekly trannyshack cabaret show.

Its £5 on the door, please confirm if you will be there and I can get us some seats booked - doors at 6:30, the show usually starts 7:30

... At 5pm we will all wander back towards the Overground station to catch the 24 bus to Trafalgar square, admire Nelson's Column and take a nice chill walk along the Thames in the afternoon sun. 

After this I have no real plan and I’m not going to make one. 

Bring food and drink for Parliament hill if you want. Someone needs to bring a football!

NOTE: We are meeting at Parliament hill in Hampstead heath, NOT Primrose hill. Also this is dependent on the weather, if it’s raining I will post an updated plan but it most likely will involve a pub not far from Hampstead heath Overground station.

It would be a pleasure to serve you some of our food. But, also to get some really important feedback before we settle into somewhere permanent. The food is all chicken based we have: traditional fried chicken, Korean fried chicken wings, a couple of fried chicken sandwiches (and one veggie option), chicken skins and a range of sides.

I'm trying to meet everyone who turns up each week but really can't with so many, nothing personal if I don't get to say hi!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

For those of you who don't know Smoked Meat is the second best Canadian food after Poutine (and just ahead of Maple syrup). Now the Maple Leaf do atrocious Poutine, but since they're not handling the Smoked Meat, it leads me to believe it should be good.

Hello LSC'ers!

I have spoken with a few about the possibility of an LSC Curry Night and it seems like this is of interest, especially since one hasn't been done for a while.

I keep hearing good things about [Dishoom](http://www.dishoom.com), so figured it could be a welcome alternative to the usual favourites (Tayyabs etc).

The current proposal is for Saturday 19th @ ~7pm. If there's enough interest I'll look at getting something booked, then update with more info.

Of course, we can always do drinks after too.

Thanks!

Thanks waveygravey! 

~~Here is a rockaoke FAQ!~~
    
~~What is rockaoke? Is it karaoke but only rock songs?~~      
~~No! Rockaoke is like karaoke but with a LIVE BAND!~~     
    
~~Wow, that sounds amazing!~~    
~~I know!~~          
     
~~But how will I know what words to sing?~~    
~~They have the words printed out!~~       
      
~~But how will I know when to come in and stuff?~~      
~~Well it does help if you know the song reasonably well but the band is there to help you out, they will do stuff like count you in and point at the words if you get lost.~~      
      
~~What if I am not a very good singer?~~    
~~Great! Even better! Just rock out more and no one will notice!~~       
     
~~Do any of the band members have cats?~~     
~~Yes!~~      
      
~~Is it ok to come if I am new/have never come to a lsc event before/have just arrived in town/am shy/don't like to sing/am a girl/only have one arm/am not really sure about all this?~~       
~~Yes! Everyone is welcome except those underage or people who do not like fun.~~     
      
~~I do not like fun.~~      
~~Have you tried playing polar bear in irc? It might be right up your street! JUST KIDDING I love polar bear in irc~~       
                  
~~SHUT UP RAMBLING WHAT TIME DOES THIS HAPPEN?~~    
~~The band starts at 9 or something I guess I dont know, we usually get there about 8pm. Get there earlier if you would like to watch some men carry heavy band equipment down a flight of stairs or drink at reasonable prices or chat with some crack addicts.~~

Poker, all welcome, start at around 3pm, actual details (buy in, rebuys, etc to be worked out, but probably around £25 depending on what other people think).

Venue seems to be my house (SE25 / Norwood Junction) but am open to other offers ;)

We'll make sure to have a few hands as a dry run for people who are a bit rusty or who haven't played before.

**More details:**  
^This ^is ^just ^what ^I ^was ^thinking, ^please ^speak ^out ^and ^let ^me ^know ^if ^people ^have ^other ^preferences

* No Limits Texas Hold'em (if there's enough people and/or interest then maybe some Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo Poker or other poker variant)
* £25 is going to be the max buy in, but this could be lowered depending on everyone else
* Maybe tournament style (1st place gets 75%, 2nd place gets 25%)?

Transport:

* Train to Norwood Junction (take the Woodside / Clifford Road exit) and then a 7 minute walk
* Train to East Croydon, then tram to ""Arena"" and a 4 minute walk

I've messaged everyone with my address and number, but just in case of problems, my number is 07827-820-639

I'll provide a case or two of beer and there's coffee and tea on demand, but feel free to bring supplies.

I have 4 packs of decent cards, a shuffler and a full set of chips, but more chips might not be a bad idea if anyone wants to bring some.

*How much: Price per head for food is **£19.95** including as many trips to salad/buffet bar as you wish, then you sit there and have as much meat as you want for as long as you want. They offered a 10% discount if we're a large group so it could be even cheaper! (Drinks not included in above price)

If we're feeling brave, we can head on down to the [Pipeline](http://www.thepipelinebar.co.uk/) for some pool, pinball, and more beer... hair of the dog and all that. Or we could just go and drink massive amounts of water and rehydrate. Whatever floats your boat.

One of England's oldest cemeteries. Apparently it's like the set of a horror film in there.

I have heard all about this cemetery it sounds/looks incredible. We will be visiting the West cemetery. £7 to get in and it's on a first come first serve basis so we need to get there a little early. [tour info here](http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/index.php/tours)

We will meet at Archway station (On northern line) at 10am... Hope to see you there. **Each tour takes a maximum of 15 people.**

[Website](http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/index.php/home)

 **What is the difference between the East and the West Cemetery?**

""The West Cemetery is very slightly older than the East (about 20 years) and has larger architectural structures. The East has a larger number of notable people buried in it, including Karl Marx, George Eliot and Douglas Adams. A map of the East Cemetery is available to buy at the entry gate.""

So I've come to a conclusion: Screw it, it's made to be learned, I'll DM. I've bought the red box (D&amp;D 4e Essentials), which is enough for the first couple levels, and I'm going to buy a couple more books (The essentials player handbooks, and the DM kit, which is level 3-4) I have nearly no experience in pen and paper gaming, but many of the people who wanted to play had none, or nearly none either. We might as well learn together.

My current idea is that we play through a few of the ""beginner"" adventures as a learning experience, then start a bigger campaign after we know what we're doing, and what we want as a group. (Either a pre-packed one, or I'd be willing to create as we go.)

Is anyone (still) interested? Can anyone host? (or give a good idea for a spot to host?) I'm good for pretty much any nights or afternoons except Wednesdays.

----
Sports-desk legend and king of chat Alan Partridge (Coogan) needs no introduction.

Although his TV show was tragically axed after he accidentally shot a guest, and his career in promotional videos was cut short when some angry farmers dropped a cow on him from a bridge, his reign as a radio presenter on North Norfolk Digital has triumphantly (and inexplicably) continued. When a sacked DJ named Pat (Meaney) returns to the studios with a shotgun, a hostage situation ensues, and the police naturally send in Partridge as a negotiator.

The mayhem that ensues includes a very small explosion, a slow car chase through Norwich city centre, and a tense game of cat-and-mouse around Cromer Pier.

Partridge’s first big-screen outing, ALPHA PAPA takes one of Britain’s most beloved comedic creations to greater heights than ever.

----

So, let's do it then. We'll be going for the **2100** showing at [**Hackney Picture House**](http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Hackney_Picturehouse/) in **ROW E** - [**tickets here**](http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Hackney_Picturehouse/film/Alan_Partridge_Alpha_Papa/show/syxk7t/) for £10 each.

Before that we'll hit up the nearby [**Cock Tavern**](http://www.thecocktavern.co.uk/) for drinks and food from about 7, and if you can't find me then give me a shout on 0791 double two double one 231.

Yup, 18 months of chilling, chatting and drinking on Monday evenings and the event just gets stronger and stronger. Thanks to all that have come along.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few who will eat there, the food is standard pub grub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

It's the first day of Wimbledon, so it'll probably rain. But we'll chance it anyhow.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

If you're coming from the station it'd be a bit faster to walk down Shepherds Bush Road and then enter brook green on the right rather than the normal route to Latymers down Hammersmith road and entering brook green on the left.

There is also a pub quiz on in the pub Monday nights, I think we'll be able to sit in the restaurant section towards the back to avoid interrupting it when it gets too cold to stay outside.

We'll be out back in the beer garden, I'll try to update this on the day with where in the garden.



I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me. It is difficult to get signal in the garden though.

So. Seeing as our beloved /u/Verbify is re-creating that heady feeling of summer 2011 with Bar 55, I decided to continue the illusion, by having some more Surbitonism. What *is* Surbitonism, though? Well really, one would have to be a dedicated Surbologist to give a full answer, but basically it's London but with more shrubs. I think it might technically be in Surrey. It's inside the M25 though, a fact that often reassures.

OK, so, please can all persons possessing fun and coolness report to **The Waggon and Horses** (10 mins' walk from Surbiton station - [map](http://goo.gl/maps/q41Wf)) by 8pm on **Monday 8th July**. You do not have to possess vast knowledge, and you do not have to possess Surbitonianity. (Look at me, for instance, I'm going because it's half way between London and Woking.) A taste for curry might be good though, because afterwards we can go to the East India restaurant - YAY! - where the food is half price if you pay cash. It got a great write-up in *The Surbitonian*, and apparently isn't a money-laundering front at all!

I've booked the downstairs area which can accommodate 15 - 20 people with 2 gaming tables and 2 consoles set up for people to play. Should we get more people the upstairs area has 3 or 4 more tables and another couple of consoles.

The bar already has a pretty decent selection of board games available to play, including Catan, The Resistance, Gears of War, King of Tokyo, Resident Evil Deck Building Game, Battlestar Galactica, plenty of others. People can of course bring whatever they want to play themselves though.

Video game wise I reckon we can set up a Tekken or Street Fighter Tournament of some sort and duke it out to determine the champion (it'll be me).

For those of you who just like to drink (you know who you are) there's also bottled beers at I think £2.50, cocktails both from MADD and video game themed 'power-up' cocktails. There's also a good selection of coffees and fruit drinks.

For those of you wanting food I'm not sure the do have cakes and ice creams as well as offers on meals, but I've only had a cake from there. Plenty of places nearby if it doesn't suit.

Ordinarily there'd be a min fee to cover the use of the space, but they've said to come along for free to check the place out first so we can determine if it's worth going back on a weekend as a substitute for Penderel's Oak (so if you can make it, please do).

While you can of course rock up on the night I'd appreciate shouts of 'In!' if you're coming so I can gauge whether this is going to be worth it or not.

The gig is basically Rock Band / Guitar Hero, on stage, at a pub. Cool lighting, smoke machine, Karaoke + plastic instruments, with 1000's of songs in the track list. 

Not many people arrive early, so if you do, you get to play *a lot*.
The pub has food, and you can have dinner downstairs where the rocking happens, although getting a table is sometimes challenging.

Join me for some hard-core Fake Plastic Rocking!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

As part of that effort I am hosting the Science Museum Lates this month! Yay!

&gt; **Mending a Broken Heart**

&gt; Lates this month is in conjunction with the British Heart Foundation as we delve into the world of science and look deep into our hearts.
&gt; http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/events/events_for_adults/Lates.aspx

Anyone that is mildly interested in science, then this may appeal to you! This is a fairly good event for new people, it's drinking-optional, and is more central than Hammersmith (Thank God.) 

Things avaliable at all Science Museum Lates:

* Children-free hands-on science!
* Access to most of the regular exhibits.
* A Silent Disco.
* Speed Dating (At a cost of £10 and pretty much the entire evening time-wise.)
* A pub quiz that I've been told, but don't believe for a second, that we once won. (This costs £2 per person, and the theme will be the event for each month.)
* Cash bars littered around the Museum, and you can order food at the pub quiz (be warned, it's pricey.)

This months event includes:

* CPR Training

&gt; Join nurses from the British Heart Foundation to find out all you need to know about CPR to leap into action and save a life.

* Introducing Arduino

&gt; Get a hands-on introduction to Arduino, an open-source platform for designers, artists and hobbyists.

* Punk Science

&gt; Punk Science comedy duo attempt to make the world's largest heart and try to mend a broken heart live on stage.

* Mending Broken Hearts

&gt; Three scientists present their ideas to cure heart disease... hosted by Guardian science correspondent, Alok Jha.

* Warning Signs

&gt; Have British Heart Foundation advertising campaigns have shocked the public into looking after the old ticker...

* ... and much more!


We meet up for alcoholic beverages (or not) at the Hoop and Toy around 6pm, then as a group we wonder over to the museum around 6:45pm. (Maybe a little later if the science museum has a queue.) http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/37/3741/Hoop_and_Toy/South_Kensington

I know the Hoop and Toy is a pretty shitty pub, but I dunno, it's what we do. It'll be cheaper than buying drinks within the museum itself and it's close to the station. It's also generally fairly crowded so if we don't find a space inside it's easy to just stand out the front of the Hoop and Toy with all the smokers. 

(**Edit:** at some point before we head over to the museum, I will pop to visit: http://www.auxmerveilleux.com/ supposedly it's the best desert dish that has ever been invented by the French. I've heard amazingly good things, and it's only just opened in London this month. I'm thinking once enough people are at the pub we can pop and get some around 6:20, so that we'll be back at the pub before 6:45 again in order to head to the museum.)

For the third instalment of LSC Bookclub, I am hosting south of the river. The book for the month of February will be *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson ([Goodreads link for the summary](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/830.Snow_Crash)).

I'm posting this early so people have time to read the book. There are really good transport links from central London to Peckham, via bus, train and/or overground, and you'd be reading a good book with a great group of people.

* **[Website](http://www.thebloomsbury.com/event/run/1740)**

Here's where it gets complicated: The show is selling out fairly quickly, but it's also allocated seating at checkout without being able to choose a seat. So what probably makes sense is that you can either:

* Buy a ticket for yourself (or a group of you) at the risk that you'll probably be sitting away from the rest of us (but we'll still be around for before/interval/after stuff), but with more chance of getting a ticket before they sell out.
* We pool money together, and buy a bunch of tickets in one go. This means we'll be more likely to sit together, but has more chance of things going wrong if the show sells out before we actually buy the tickets.

I plan to buy my own ticket before midday on Sunday. If anyone wants me to buy a ticket for them at the same time, you can paypal me the appropriate amount (to my reddit username at gmail dot com) before Sunday and I'll order your ticket at the same time as mine. Alternatively, if you happen to see me tomorrow, you can give me the money in person (although that would require the remarkable coincidence of you either being at Earl's Court, O2 Academy Brixton or Fluid Bar at the same time as me).

I've not used Paypal to receive money for ages, so I can't remember if it lets you attach notes to payments. If it does, include your

* Reddit name
* Real name
* If you're eligible for a concession, which one (it needs to be specified when the ticket's purchased, check the website for the categories)

It would be helpful if you could PM me the same details, including your PayPal email, just so I can keep track of it all.

If it all goes wrong and they sell out before I buy the tickets, I'll refund you obviously.

Does anyone actually read this line? I do change it every week.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices (I think) and water.*

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

Location/Time: [Latymers](http://latymershammersmith.co.uk/), W6 8BS / from 18:00ish

The table is reserved every Monday for the rest of the year. Hopefully the staff will remember each week.
If it is reserved it's the long table with 'sofa benches' on 3 side on the right as you enter the pub.

I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me.

You find yourself tired of work, play, or just tired of doing nothing. You need a little something to make your Monday worth it. A little...test. A test of intellect, a test of knowledge, a test of will and a test of skill.

But how? Going to a bar merely tests your hand-eye coordination. Can I reach my wallet without spilling my drink? Not dangerous enough to be worth it.

But doing it *while being asked questions about anything from obscure 60s Dutch films to the mountain ranges of Portugal?* That's a death sentence to be sure.


So, you must not worry, and love the Mub Quiz. We may win. We may lose. We may win **and** lose. Think about it.

Over to our logistics officer for the details:

**WHAT DO I DO?**

Mubz usually starts at around 8ish, but it's good to get in there early to grab seats and/or drinks.

1. Go to Kentish Town tube station, on Monday, or whenever you like really, we're not stopping you.
2. Leave the station (cannot stress how important this bit is)
3. Turn right and cross the road. If you haven't done step 2, this one may be awkward. Please be sure you have done the previous one.
4. Enter... **The Assembly House**
5. Success!

If you're having trouble with number 4. or have tried to do step 3 without having done step 2, feel free to grab me on oh7eight7eight21six579

Tickets are £25 (or £20 if you're a member), which may or may not be a bargain depending on how much you enjoy watching Sigourney Weaver run around a spaceship in her undies.

The screening starts at 7PM. The listing on the website seems to suggest it will start with *Prometheus*, so I will leave it up to the group as to whether people would rather go to that or wait until *Alien* (which will probably begin around 9PM). If we don't see *Prometheus*, I suggest we go and get some food in Chinatown somewhere (maybe Young Cheng?).

I think the movies are around 2 hours each, plus a 10/15 minute interval between showings, so things will probably wrap up around 5/6AM, by which time we'll probably be so hysterical with sleep deprivation that sitting through *Resurrection* will sound like a good idea.

The queen gets two birthdays, so why shouldn't I?

**Deposit is required now!  Here's what you have to do:**

 - Call 01832 280490, say you're jumping with me (you'll need my real name, ""fross"" won't do :) ) on 28th July, 12:30pm.
 - Pay £50 by credit/debit card over the phone.  You can also arrange bank transfer if you prefer.  They will confirm by email.
 - Ideally drop me a PM or post here saying you've paid your deposit so I can organise.  That's all!

Here's some details:

- On the afternoon of Saturday July 28th. Location is Sibson Airfield,
Wansford, 
Peterborough,
PE8 6NE - http://www.skydivesibson.co.uk/

- It'll cost £205 for the whole jump (group rate), £50 deposit this week, the rest on the day.  This is about as cheap as a tandem jump gets.

- It is a tandem jump, so you're strapped to someone. You get some training on the ground first but basically they take care of everything. You don't need any prior experience or training. We go up in groups of about 7, so there will be multiple runs. Weather permitting it should take about 2-2.5 hours total.

- We can fit about TWENTY FIVE people on this. There might be room for a few more, we basically will have the afternoon at the place to ourselves. The sooner I know the better.

- Anyone is welcome to come along and not jump, that is of course free etc and unlimited numbers.

- There is an upper weight limit of 15.5 stone / 98.5 kilos clothed, in case that's an issue for anyone.

- While I'm hoping the weather at the end of July will mean we can do the jump fine, we may not be able to jump that day. If so, I will try to reschedule the whole group, though I know that's difficult. Basically, you will have to make the jump sometime within the next 12 months or you can forfeit your deposit.

A few redditors have mentioned to me about putting together a 5-7 aside astroturf football game, and I wanted to put the feelers out to see who would be interested in showing off their silky skills. We would need a minimum of about 10 people to make it anyway interesting, and  there would be no minimum required standard, everyone is welcome if you want to play! Its would just be a bit of a friendly kickabout for fun and fitness, maybe followed by a cheeky pint or two if you can look the opposition in the face afterwards.


If we do have the interest I would be happy enough to book and arrange it, it would probably work at at about £3-4 a game, and would cost less if we have more players. In responding to this post, let me know if would be interested, what day of playing would suit you best, and what location would be best. I'll try my best to find something that suits :)


On location and times, venues closer to the city will most likely be a bit more expensive, that those in say Camden, Kensington or Whitechapel. Also peak times for games are weekday evenings after work, so booking these times also tends to cost a bit more, whereas weekends are cheaper. 


Anyway, let me know what you think. If anybody has any suggestions for improving this post aswell, please let me know.


P.S. To let you know what level of ability I am at and show I'm no George Best, [here](http://i.imgur.com/38cGP.jpg) is a picture of me(no.7) looking utterly dejected as the opposition runs in their NINTH goal of the game while we scored none. Our defence was as porous as swiss cheese all season..


UPDATE: I'm going to check out two pitches tomorrow, the one at whitechapel Sports Centre and the one at Haggerston, and see which one is best for us. We have good interest so I'm thinking first game on Saturday the 7th July around 3pm, but will confirm this at the weekend. First 13 people to say they are definitely in to play once it has been confirmed, play the first game :) Sound Fair?

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to do, it's just a bit harder for me to get around. I've got low vision, and walk with a white cane. I can see well enough that I got from Gatwick to my hostel (Palmer's Lodge in Swiss Cottage).

Is anyone interested in grabbing a pint and touring about the city a bit? For the record, I'm a 28-year old Canadian guy, a writer, writing about travelling alone with a disability. Guys or girls, whoever is willing to tour me around, message me! As far as places to go for drinks, I prefer a quieter pint and good conversation. ny ideas?

So far Londoners have been great. Quick to offer help and suggestions, simply on the sight of my cane. They say we Canadians are polite. We got it from somewhere.


**UPDATE** 

So it looks like the night's kind of shot. It was short notice and jet lag kicked my ass earlier. I'm awake and active now, but it seems everyone's already out. I'm going to try to find some food and maybe hang in. If someone still wants to meet me for a pint tonight, I'll be up for that! Otherwise, maybe tomorrow? Museum trip or lunch?

While tickets are pricey (£24), this is one of the few events where you get to try a lot of dishes from some very good restaurants at bargain prices. (Around £4-5 for a taster).

I didn't make it last year, but year before went, and spent about £30 + ticket price to get both rather nicely toasted and full of tasty food. The quails egg I had I still remember. So if you do wish to come, expect it to cost you around £50-60 all up.
And they sell jugs of cocktails as well.

**Depending on the weather I may not go.  Looks unlikely at the moment.**

It's happening. I just need an official list of who would be interested in coming along.

The key facts:

* We'll be looking for a catered chalet in one of the popular resorts in either France or Austria (Though Italy and Switzerland could also be options)
* In a majority of Chalets, the cost per person when booking only covers the accomodation. So flights, ski hire and lift passes are NOT covered. Meals are also covered, but only for six days, as staff have Sundays off. Airport transfers are covered in a majority of cases.
* The accommodation can vary between £250 -&gt; £800 alone. Flights can vary depending on airline, but I would budget for about £150 return.
* Lift passes can be almost £200 for seven days.
* You **SHOULD** get travel insurance that covers winter sports. This can be an additional charge on top of your regular travel insurance.
* The date of the first week of February was chosen due to the French school holidays falling later in the month, and leading to anarchy in the resorts. It also doubles the price per person.
* The resorts cater for all skiing types, and many have ski schools within. Of course, if you just want to build snowmen and drink, you can, but I imagine that would get very boring quickly.
* The UK is **NOT** part of the [Schengen Zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area) which allows visa holders to pass unrestricted within. You would need a Schengen visa to be granted by the country we decide to fly into. EU passport holders will still need their passports.

If you are interested, be prepared to budget up to £1000 for the week, which will likely have to be paid in advance.

Following on for my last post to find something to do for St. Patricks Day, I went on a bit of a mission today, and found a good place to kick it off!!

___________________________________________________________

This saturday is the most beautiful of days, St. Patrick's Day, the day before everyone resents the Irish for the things they did in the name of ""craic"" the previous night. Imma be heading down to [**The Water Poet**](http://waterpoet.co.uk/index.php), an a fairly classy Irish pub (although I'm sure that'll go out the window on Saturday) just between Shore Ditch High Street Station and Liverpool Street, directions [here](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=the+water+poet).   

Throughout the day they will have some lively Irish music, a BBQ and some traditional Irish grub (mainly potatoes cooked in different ways or served on different plates or something), and will be showing the Ireland versus England rugby match in the evening.

As it is Paddy's Day they couldnt take that many reservations, of which all were booked up months ago, but its a big venue, and there should be plenty of space to meander around. There is also a big outdoor smoking area aswell.

I'll be heading down to get secure some space there at midday, and hope y'all can come along, it should be good fun. OH ok then...craic.
___________________________________________________________

At around 7 when you have all had enough of the Irish, we can then moving on to [**Kick Bar**](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=kick+bar&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=IANhT6HCG4bOhAep_5yHBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCIQ_AUoAg) just up the road, and depending on how many people are still alive later still, we will gather the survivors and head to [**Mother**](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=mother+shoreditch&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=6gJhT8eFFdS4hAeokoHQBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCIQ_AUoAg), just off hoxton square, for a wee dance.

So we're doing Whisky instead.  How this will render him less hungover on Saturday, I do not understand.  It was his idea to do whisky.

Anyway in case anyone is free Friday, I can sign in 2 more guests.

My mate Toby is a bit of an entrepreneur (his main product at the moment is some project managment software @ http://www.completeproject.com/), so our conversations tend to be a mix between coding, business ideas &amp; some hardcore geek stuff (last time we had a discussion about the various theories behind quasars).  So just warning you now. 

As usual I don't expect much interest, but am always pleasantly surprised with LSC.  I will have to give preference to those I already promised &amp; if there are any other entrepreneur's out there, Toby is a good guy to know. 

For the spiel.

Scotch Malt Whisky Society is a non-exclusive private club (i.e. you pay £100 for membership, you're a member). 

http://www.smws.co.uk

They've got a deal with most of the major distillers to bottle unique casks. Most bottlings are only in the range of 200-300 bottles, unique to the world. Once it's sold out, it's gone for ever.

Friday's all whisky drams are capped at £6 (except for Tartan at £24.50). Few Friday's ago I enjoyed a very nice 34 year old Speyside Lossie from Glen Moray - for £6 (retail price of bottle £160).

http://www.smws.co.uk/venues/19_Greville_Street,_London

Here's a guide to the codes. 

http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/trivia/smws-distillery-numbers.html

The bottles are normally numbered with distillery.number of cask sold.

BTW, this is not an event if you just want to get pissed (well you will do that - all whisky's are cask strength - so around 50% alcohol), it's good whisky. But if you're a whisky novice, it's totally fine as well. The staff know their stuff and have managed to convert a few drinkers into loving whisky.

I'll be there from 6pm. I can only sign in 2 more guests, so check with me first. But they are flexible, I also tip well, all the staff know me and chances are there will be a few other members there that I know who will be able to sign you in.  Worse case it's a £10 cover.

1326281993.0,10,self.LondonSocialClub,oc8qr,[11/02/11] - Clay Pigeon Shooting @ Bisley,Kaer,10,0,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oc8qr/110211_clay_pigeon_shooting_bisley/,"Some of you know that I do Clay Pigeon shooting as my main sport (it suits my level of fitness and co-ordination) and expressed an interest in joining me sometime.

This is shotgun shooting against moving clay targets in a variety of different stands.  The only shooting you can easily do in the UK is with a shotgun.  No handguns at all and rifle shooting is fairly tricky to get into.

It is not cheap.  For a shared hour lesson, where you'll shoot around  80-100 cartridges at the same number of clays it will cost around **£80**.  And this is the discounted rate as I'm a member.

Full price list over here.

http://www.bisleyshooting.co.uk/PriceList.html

I've taken a few people down who have never shot before.  They walk you through everything, from fitting you with a shotgun, gun safety to hitting your first clay.  Even my most uncoordinated mate managed to hit a few.  

They provide everything, ear protection, shotgun etc.  Just wear closed toe shoes and a cap is useful depending on what you are shooting to stop stray clay bits heading your face.

Bisley shooting ground is interesting.  Last month when I was down a re-inactment group was shooting a German WWI machine gun.  And the armed police response unit were practising with their Heckler &amp; Koch submachine guns.

It's an hour drive there.  Bisley is 30 miles west of London.   First 40 minutes of london traffic suck, last 20 minutes a sweet drive in the country.  If you come to my house (10 minute walk from Crystal Palace Station) you can hitch a ride with me.   I normally head down before lunch, grab lunch at a local pub, shoot for an hour or two, then come back.  

I doubt there will be much interest, but it's capped at 3 people coming with me.  And if you don't call shotgun expect to get lots of dog hairs on you from siting in the back seat of the car.

Here's a pic of me shooting last time I went : http://imgur.com/vUIAv.jpg

Here's some video I took of my last two mates I took down, both of them first time shooting :

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFj_-kmVTzs

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twY_KwNcISk

Multiple traps, normally shoot half a dozen or so shots at each section.

EDIT:   **Updated Details**

Went down today and chatted to them, booked it in for a provisionally 8 people.  Total cost is **£85** each. Shoot for 2 hours, 100 cartridges each.  BTW, this is members rates, normally it would cost you £120, so I'm saving you money :)  We do a 20 shot mini comp to pick the best shot.  And do a driven game shoot at the end.  4 people line up, they fire clays over you head while you all shoot at once.

Time will be 11am-1pm for the shoot.  Need to be there at 10:30am.  If you're getting a lift you need to be at mine by 9:15am (I'm a 15 minute walk from Crystal Palace Station, I'll PM attendees my address).  Feel free to come earlier if you want to play with Charlie. As many as want to come can shoot, but unless you have a way to get down there, you're out of luck.  Also need to confirm exact numbers the Wednesday(8th Feb) prior.  If you pull out after then and no-one takes your place, you owe me £40.

Grab lunch after, so we should be back in town around 3:30pm or so.

EDIT:   **Updated Details 28/1/12 **

Righto, I'm going to PM everyone who submitted their interest.  A deposit has to be paid of £40 for the shoot, so you'll have to transfer some cash over to me before then to confirm.  So this list might be updated.  I'll post up a new thread once it's all sorted.  InsertRandomName is planning on catching the train down the cabbing it in, should only be a £10 for the cab, so you can always head down with her.

IN (Max 8 - and we're full.  Ping me if you want to be on the ""reserve"" list.  Or have transport down.  No capped number to come, just limited seats to drive down).  And we've got another driver, so all good (cheers salnajjar!) :

So who would be interested in a ""Record club""? Something like a once a month get together where we could share new / old music we've discovered over the previous month. 

I'd be up for hosting the first one at my place (I suppose up to a limit of 10 people or so). 

I know, I know, we could easily do it online over Reddit or email or whatever, but I realised this weekend that none of my friends are into music the way I am. I really miss sitting down with people and listening to and discussing new (or old, newly discovered) music. 

OK, discuss!

edit: Also, if there is a lot of interest, it may be worth subdividing it into genres? 

**IMPORTANT EDIT:** Sorry, just to be clear, this isn't an exclusively vinyl event. Actually it will most likely be predominantly CD / Grooveshark - based.

**Don't forget to bring a print out of your ticket.**

Here are the details from the organisers:

**Start:** 

The game starts at 7pm at [a secret location]. We release players in groups of six to eight people, every 80 secs. There will be a queue, so if you want to get released close to 7pm, arrive early. If you don't mind what time you are released, you can arrive any time up to 8pm. 

**What to wear &amp; bring:** 

A mobile phone is useful to find friends and ask for help if you get lost. Some money is good. This is a game not a race, but it is a physical game, so dress accordingly. Think of it this way: if you had time to dress for the zombie apocalypse what would you wear? If you’re thinking weather appropriate clothes that allow you the comfort and manoeuvrability to out-run a zombie, stand up to exposure to zombie gore* while keeping your phone and valuables safe then you are getting close. Oh, also, we love costumes, so feel free to let rip with your favourite zombie survivor character.

I'm planning to cycle from London to Paris, and been looking into the logistics of it.  Here is the plan:

* The journey is about 280 miles.  Plan to do it in 5 days, ~60 miles a day (quite leisurely at 10mph for 6 hours riding, perfectly achievable), plus take an extra day in Brittany saying hi to our cross-channel cousins, then a day in Paris before taking the Eurostar back (or longer if you want).

* Some people are talking about driving alongside, this would make it a lot easier on the cyclists as it would be a ""support vehicle"" and we wouldn't have to carry our bags. ;)  

* Probably best if you have a bike, though it's perfectly possible to hire a nice one for a week.  

* You have 6 months to be fit enough to do it!  But as mentioned above this isn't the tour de france, it would be a quite leisurely pace, you just need to be able to do it a few days in a row.

* Staying in BnBs along the way - it's a quite popular route so there are regular cycling-friendly spots.  Another possibility is pack tents in the car and do it the cheap way, if everyone's up for that!

We already have a rollcall!  Though this is all tentative and just looking for discussion, anyone interested, and anybody who may have experience in this sort of thing.

Here’s what I’ve been thinking:  

First to the photo exhibition at the [Museum of London](http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/London-Wall/Whats-on/Exhibitions-Displays/London-Street-Photography)  

Then shimmy our way towards Farringdon and [Tinseltown](http://www.tinseltown.co.uk/Farringdon) for some burgery and milkshaky (50 different flavours!!!) goodness (the eatery can be changed, but shimmy is NOT optional)  

Then roll on to a pub/drinkery nearby, maybe [Smiths of Smithfield](http://www.smithsofsmithfield.co.uk/sos/index.html)? Other ideas are welcomed!  

See you at 4pm at the museum?  

And when the time is right, we shall head to the Bingo Rebellion! I can't wait! 

**Edit 1: For those of you joining for food, I think we'll be at Tinseltown around 5.30pm, that'll give us an hour at the museum and time to shimmy along for the shakes and burgers.**

Hopefully this will restore my honour. Well if it does I'll quickly destroy it with another trip to the hospital due to a stupid dance move. It's inevitable.

Here is the plan. [MAP LINK](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=214372244812342521046.0004a835d7c54ba50a1c5&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.51582,-0.135527&amp;spn=0.015089,0.021908)

I have taken the concerns raised recently, and modified our plan slightly. We will be taking in 5 venues only, and spending a minimum of two hours in each. This will allow others to find us more easily, and to help people get comfortable before we make them walk out into sunlight. I know your feelings against natural light, and I'll accomodate them.

Here is the plan: (It hasn't changed much, thanks to Critdragon already notifying places)

1pm - Market Place Bar, 9/10 Market Place, London W1W 8AQ

Nearest tube is Oxford Circus

3pm - The Eagle Bar, 3-5 Rathbone Place London W1T 1HJ

Nearest Tube: Tottenham Court Road

5pm – The Royal George, Soho – WC2H 0EA

Nearest Tube: Tottenham Court Road

7pm - The Montagu Pyke, 105-107 Charing Cross Road London WC2H 0DT

Nearest Tubes: Tottenham Court Road, Covent Garden and Leicester Square

9pm – Thirst Bar, W1D 3DR (Booked in the name Reddit, expecting 50+. Upstairs area is ours and ours alone **until 3am**)

Nearest Tubes: Tottenham Court Road, Covent Garden and Leicester Square

**SO** the only changes are, we've dropped The Cock. That's right. No Cock in this crawl. No one has to drink at The Cock this time. So get all the cock jokes out of your system now. I just did, and they were lame. You can do better.

It looks like [Richmond Park](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=&amp;sll=51.436247,-0.272942&amp;sspn=0.062923,0.154324&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=51.436247,-0.272942&amp;spn=0.062923,0.154324&amp;z=13) it is, it is fairly hilly but we can go at the pace of the slowest person. 

Rough Start Time - Approx 1000 -1100 meet in Richmond Park

Meetup Point - Probably Roehampton Gate [map](http://www.theaa.com/images/travel/maps/cycles/London_Cycle_Map8.gif).

Lunch - Aim for around 1400 in Richmond on the bank of the Thames.  You can either bring or buy there, the choice is fairly big with lots of shops and a few bars/pubs etc.

Distance/Route - Undecided currently, I would welcome any input.  I was also thinking of adding in a trip to Bushey Park, this would involve some roads though. No more than 30 miles at the very top end, and even for beginners, at an easy pace, this is quite dooable.

Bikes and kit - Boris Bikes have been mentioned, I am not sure if they are allowed that far from the centre of London, I do know that they are not really suited to long rides, especially when paired up against normal bikes (mountain/hybrid/road).  Bike hire might be possible if you want to. I have a road bike, so the route will be mainly in very well worn tracks of roads/paths within the park.  I don't have much kit in the way of puncture repair, pumps or spare tubes, so if someone has, it would be awesome if you could bring them along.

Getting there - Closest Tube is East Putney on the District (just checked and the District is running this weekend).  It's a 2.5 mile cycle from there to the Roehampton Gate.  I think Barnes Station might be a bit closer, but then you would have to get to Waterloo, whereas the District has a pretty good coverage of London.  I may might be able to meet people there and then we can cycle to RG together.

Safety - Helmets if you have them

If anybody wants to meet somewhere near central London to ride down, PM me.  I am coming from Charlton (near Greenwich), and will probably train to Waterloo and ride down from there.  I will be there regardless, but will wait a while for anybody that is running a little late.

Route - Nothing too strenuous, a few laps (there are loads of routes to take), a visit to the Isabella Plantation and a ride into Richmond for a bite to eat on the Thames.  We can end it whenever, wherever the group decides.

We have a Redditor from NYC visiting who enquired about Shisha &amp; Cards. There seemed to be a lot of interest, so I thought I'd post up the event.


The plan is: **Dar [Marrakesh](http://dar-marrakesh.co.uk/) on Edgeware Rd @ 7pm**. I don't have a pack of cards, so if someone could bring some, that'd be great.


We've done a few ""unofficial"" shisha meetups recently and they've been a lot of fun. Think board games meetups, but more awesome and with fruity things to smoke (sorry board games organisers).


I know it's short notice, but feel free to come along to enjoy the last of the good weather if you're free.

I've been to the last 3 and unlike the smaller festivals there is usually a decent range of beer on the last day since they get deliveries throughout the week - I've been able to try the festival winner both times. If we meet early we should be able to get a table which is very useful.

Event runs 11am-7pm on the Saturday.

Tickets are £10, £8 for CAMRA members - if you're thinking of joining CAMRA I'd recommend doing so inside the festival for extras. Beers are usually very reasonably priced, the strong foreign ones will be a bit costly.

You can bring your own pint glass, or place a deposit on an event one when there (which you can keep) - beers are served in pints, 1/2s and 1/3s with no penalty on price for the smaller quantities - this allows you to try plenty of different beers and styles. Staff are usually very happy to give you a taster of a beer too.

Non-beer drinkers are very welcome, I've been with people who usually enjoy trying the various fruit wines. There wont be much lager about, but the real beers are so much better anyway. Well most of them.. there are always some shockers.

Any other questions, please ask!

I realise this is the same day as the pub crawl, but this is the only weekend date for the festival- you could always head there after (if you can still walk)..

If you'd like to go during the week when the festival is a little quieter /u/phenorbital is hosting a meet [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/1hxerb/150813_great_british_beer_festival_olympia/) for the Thursday.

Holy shit guys! Let's go see one of the most influential bands I've never yet had the chance to experience live! As a wee teenager I fell in love with their album As The Roots Undo and living in California, they never came out to that side of the country. Now they're touring for the first time in a long while and coming right here to London. Who's got two thumbs and is excited as hell? Yep, me!

In all seriousness, this three piece of amazing musicians are vets in the screamo line of music. [Check out the YOUTUBES! ""In The Nervous Light Of Sunday""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_JdtZRTDHk)

Some bit from their wiki page, 'Circle Takes the Square has been described as being a ""blend of progressive experimentation and DIY hardcore, metal, and noise...characterised by a natural fusion of grindcore and the sweeping guitar dynamics of post-punk and emo"".They describe themselves as ""...a punk rock band with reverence for the Mystery."" Lars Gotrich, when writing for NPR music credited Circle Takes the Square alongside bands Orchid and Pg.99 as being prominent influences on emotional post-hardcore.'

I suggest bringing along a few litres of water and some sort of backpack as beer gets warm quick and there's many a shop to get some on the way.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few who will eat there, the food is standard pub grub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

If you're coming from the station it'd be a bit faster to walk down Shepherds Bush Road and then enter brook green on the right rather than the normal route to Latymers down Hammersmith road and entering brook green on the left.

We'll be out back in the beer garden, I'll try to update this on the day with where in the garden.

I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me. Be aware I might not have signal in the Pub Garden.

FAQ

**I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?**

Sure, most times so far we have had somebody with no experience. Soon enough they get all excited and start watching YouTube videos and building up a collection of their own.

**I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones I'll be dominating this time?**

Depends on what people bring in. Usually it's stuff that can be grasped quickly and played within an hour or two: Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, Settlers of Catan.

**Do I need to bring in anything?**

We have tea and coffee in the shop as well as some biscuits, but I'd appreciate you bringing in some of your own.

**Can I bring along some friends of mine?**

Yeah, just let me know either in the thread, on mobile or via PM, so I know if I need to get any more tables/chairs in.

I try to send out PMs the night before to remind and check if anybody's changed their mind, so it's better to leave a reply here. You can come along either way, though.

Tickets are £11.81 including booking fee and i'll probably get there a bit early to eat (£7 for a burrito and beer at the bar!)

Paula Mejia, in a Prefix magazine review, called BADBADNOTGOOD ""a jazz trio on paper -- but often strange, forever imaginative, and ultimately revolutionary hip-hop and electronic beatmakers at heart.""NOW magazine's Anupa Mistry has lauded BBNG's ""spastic, sonorous, genre-fucking rap covers.""Jerell Tongson, in describing BADBADNOTGOOD's hip hop influences, wrote that the group ""deconstruct the four bar loops, understanding how to work crescendos by stretching out and reshaping the music into their own vision of silky smooth key progressions, pounding drums, and tasty bass lines.""

The second jam was a huge success, lots of people showed up, we had a metric fuckton of fun!

Since the space could barely accommodate the number of people that we had, I'm in the process of finding a venue to hire. That means, however, that everyone will have to pitch in to cover the hire costs, the amount per person being the total hire price divided by the number of people (amount_per_person = total_price / number_of_people).

Now, worst case scenario if I am not able to hire out a place, we will use the same space as last time.

I'm in talks with two rehearsal studios, one of the studios is 11m by 5.5m, the other is 11.5m by 6.5m, so that means loads of room and both of these studios are located within 10 minutes of walking distance from Old Street station.

I'm making a list of attendees, make a comment with the type of instrument you play, I will put you down on the list, and I'll PM you with the details once they are available.

Attendees so far:

1. xska (drums)
2. qxx6 (2 electric guitarz)
3. someguyz (electric guitar + 2 cube amps)
4. Already-been-vaped (acoustic guitar)
5. arezzo (electric guitar)

We've both know that practice is the key to improving our technical drawing skills, but the last time we checked out a live modelling class, it was something like £300 a head for a set of 6 lectures... 

No one at home will sit still for long enough for us to sketch them. Or maybe there's no on at home. Period.

How about we get 6-10 like-minded artists together and be our own live models? You (and I) 'pay' for the class by modelling for a certain amount of time (20-40 mins, depending on the amount of people in the group), and then benefit by sketching a wide variety of people in return.

We could even have snacks and drinks, and some decent tunes playing in the background. We could turn this into both an educational AND social event!


I will

* provide a place (large garden/living room, depending on the weather) in South East London (Forest Hill)
* provide hot drinks
* set up Spotify with some speakers
* organise the artists and drawing schedule/drawing challenges

You will

* not question if your art skills are 'good enough' to attend this event (if you want to draw live models in a safe environment, you are invited)
* bring your own drawing supplies
* contribute to the snacks/drinks

On the flip side of the coin, if you like to wash your foie gras tikka down with a magnum of Veuve Clicquot, it'd be polite to arrange for a separate bill in advance.

* As per the sidebar, newcomers are welcome. I'll post or PM a contact mob. number a bit closer to the date, so that you can find us. (FYI, I'm a Latymer regular, and was also on the failed Dishoom Shoreditch expedition in Jan.)

* I suggest meeting at a pub from 7 onwards. [The Two Brewers](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/10/1011) should be O.K., and it's handy to the restaurant.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

For the fourth chapter (ha!) of the LSC Book Club, we will be reading The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde. Its a very creative mix of science fiction and mystery, with the added bonus of being over 100 pages shorter than Snow Crash! Its the first book in a series, but it stands alone quite well.

Here is the summary stolen from Amazon.

*Welcome to a surreal version of Great Britain, circa 1985, where time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously. England is a virtual police state where an aunt can get lost (literally) in a Wordsworth poem, militant Baconians heckle performances of Hamlet, and forging Byronic verse is a punishable offense. All this is business as usual for Thursday Next, renowned Special Operative in literary detection, until someone begins kidnapping characters from works of literature. When Jane Eyre is plucked from the pages of Brontë's novel, Thursday must track down the villain and enter the novel herself to avert a heinous act of literary homicide.*

Thought I would post this and guage interest, since I and quite a few other redditors live pretty near, and since it was just mentioned in r/london...

All information about the race itself is [here](http://theboatrace.org/)... Last year was quite eventful with the race being interrupted but I doubt that'll happen again!

However, I have no real plan. It will be busy. Really busy. It starts at 4:30 but it could be an all day event and we should get there earlier...

Possibilities:

 * Blue Anchor near Hammersmith Bridge.
 * Somewhere between Hammersmith Bridge and Chiswick there are big screens and places to get food/drink.
 * Start or Finish will be way too busy
 * Get there earlyish.
 * Picnic.
 * BYOB.
 * Bring your own dogs.
 * Easter Eggs - it's Easter Sunday after all!

The weather should be pretty good, though it may be cold and rain.

I'll figure out the consensus and go with that...and update accordingly.

I will likely make an effort to find a place relatively close to the entrance but really it's just where there are tables free that we can fill with cocktails before happy hour ends.

Happy hour is 5:30 until 7:30, so turn up before seven and load up on 2-4-1 drinks and cheap bottles of beer. There is a later happy hour that starts at 9:30 but it's not that great value-wise and I'm not planning to stay any later than 10pm. (Although people are welcome to, I'm not your mother.)

Also, there's no real requirement you have to drink, so don't worry about that. I've only been to this place once before and it was really easy to talk to people (music volume wise.) I'm not getting too drunk, with work Friday and everything.

I've done this and it's a great way to learn, it's an adults only lesson so you don't risk the embarrassment of being the oldest (I was actually the youngest last time).

They separate you in various skill levels and teach you accordingly; first time skaters are very welcome and the tutors are very very good teaching you the basics; even how to ^^basic ice skate backwards by the end of the session.

I get to stay until closing this week too!

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices (I think) and water.*

&gt;Tours through radical times and places
&gt;
&gt;East End Walks specialise in organising historical walks of London’s East End – an area in which successive waves of immigrants have helped make London what it is today.
&gt;
&gt;Our walks bring to life the people and places of the East End especially from the1880s to the 1930s. From the time when Jews arrived in large numbers from Eastern Europe to the time when they united with non-Jewish East Enders to drive out Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists at the Battle of Cable Street.

The walk tomorrow is ~~""No Gods No Masters: radicals, secularists, suffragists and pacifists"" in Bloomsbury~~ no I got that wrong, it's ""The Radical Jewish East End"", meeting at 2pm in the east end.

If this is too short notice, there are more in the future we could go on. Let me know if you like the sound of this kind of thing, I'm really interested to do some history walks around London.

Pace should be fairly easy going and the times I've done a similar ride has been fairly quiet traffic-wise. I wasn't thinking of a lunch somewhere at the end after this ride (mainly because I don't want to carry my lock around with me) but if enough people would be interested in such a ride I'm happy to change the plan.

In terms of equipment and other things to bring - bike, helmet (if you're happy with one, I'm not forcing safety on anybody), drinks, a snack of some kind, waterproof (for those sudden rain showers), pump and spare inner tube (for any unfortunate incidents) and any thing else you might take along with you on a bike ride. Hopefully between us we should have enough to deal with most eventualities.

Hopefully I should be fairly noticeable as the cyclist standing about with a red road bike (with matching red saddle) but people should feel free to get in touch if they have an issue on the day.

Dear Wonderful LSC Community!

It's that time of year again when the entire world holds its breathe for another thrilling **US Election Bonanza**! 

After 50 debates, endless gaffes and hundreds of millions of dollars (if not billions) spent by superpacs it all comes down to **one night.** Will the veteran Obama regain his crown or will he succumb to a war of attrition with Mitt ""binders full of women"" Romney? 

**If you've never watched a US Election Result before**
Thanks to the US Electoral College system- US Elections are pretty fun to watch! There's constant news streaming in and celebrations when state results are announced. Nevermind the fact that it's one of the least fairest or democratic voting systems available (those who've studied voting theory will know)- we get a night of entertainment! 

**Location:** TBC as I dig around for a good place in London, but be sure to book this into your calendars. 

**Time:** Looking to start around 7-8 to at least get the places, but be warned- results will only be announced at 3 AM at the earliest- so for all intents and purposes - treat this night as an allnighter. 

**Election Night Drinking Game!**: A drinking game will be invented for the night's enjoyment and potentially bingo if I find the time.",,False,,t5_2s87x,1351626626.0,,,True,t3_12250y,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/12250y/061112_us_election_night_tbc/,

Decanter is holding a wine tasting of 30 producers from the Friuli Venezia Giulia region of Italy. It will include somewhere around 200 wines (you are not required to try all!). Likely it will be set up as tables for one or two producers each with someone from the producer or their importer offering tastings and answering questions. Being held at the Institute of Directors on Pall Mall. Dress code of no t-shirts or trainers - it's a good chance to suit up. Event runs from 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm during which time you can arrive and leave as you wish. I will probably be there right about 6:30 so as to try lots of delicious wine. There will probably also be no food except maybe crackers, so dinner first is recommended!

Tickets are £20, here: http://www.amiando.com/friuliconsumertasting2012.html?utm_source=Decanter.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_content=Events%2Bpage%2Bfixed%2Blink&amp;utm_campaign=Friuli%2Bconsumer",,False,,t5_2s87x,False,,,True,t3_10j0wb,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/10j0wb/221012_wine_tasting_institute_of_directors/,

I am turning a lovely number of older and as I have only been in this town a short time, I find myself with a dearth of friends. However, I have met a fair number of YOU folk and we're now officially best friends. TA-DA! 

You are hereby cordially invited to join me for any and all parts of my Birthday Spectacular. Part one will be a Boozey tea party with cupcakes at [Apples&amp;amp;Pears](http://www.applesandpearsbar.com/) starting about... *6:00* ~~(i have no idea when would be best)~~ and ending when its time to go to dinner- say 8 or 8:30? 

Dinner, also known as Part 2, is a quick 7 minute walk north through the lovely streets of Shoreditch to a little place called [Boho Mexica](http://www.bohomexica.co.uk/). Why Boho Mexica you may ask? Well. Authentic and good Mexican food + **Margaritas**. You can't lose. ~~Be there are 8:30 if you're not joining for part 1.~~ **The restaurant would like us to come at 8 for dinner** So that's when we'll be there.

Part 3 will be the late night adventures at The Shoreditch, yet another 7 minute walk UP from Boho Mexica. I understand good things happen there and they are open til 2 or so on a Monday.

And optional Tuesday morning jaunt to The Breakfast Club for brunch is also on the table.

Now, I have been to none of these places, but A and C have been recommended by LSCers and B is halfway between them AND is mexican. Oh so many noms are about to happy. Here is a [google map](https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=145+Shoreditch+High+Street,+London,+E1+6JE&amp;amp;daddr=151-153+Commercial+Street,+London,+E1+6BJ+to:26+Osborn+St,+London+E1+6TD,+UK&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ll=51.524846,-0.074029&amp;amp;spn=0.018744,0.040255&amp;amp;sll=51.521668,-0.074801&amp;amp;sspn=0.018745,0.040255&amp;amp;geocode=FRI7EgMdPc7-_ykR0cBuuhx2SDHlDOHnMfQWjQ%3BFYMmEgMdcNn-_ykPs5-7thx2SDFh1WwuxoUREw%3BFRgWEgMdG-7-_ylfmbKcyhx2SDGPngrHDlNptw&amp;amp;dirflg=w&amp;amp;mra=ltm&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=15) to show the potential route for the evening. 

RSVP for A (part 1/Boozey Tea Party) and B (Margaritas and NOMS) because I will have to make reservations for those two. I really hope a bunch of you can join as it should be a right old grand jolly time for all. I mean. TEA PARTY with Liquor instead of Tea. I LIKE IT!

Interest obtained.  I forgot anything I post up here, someone is always interested :)

http://www.inthehiddencity.com/

Given a series of clues and you go from location to location in London as you solve them (including pub breaks).

http://www.inthehiddencity.com/how-it-works/

£16 per team.  I'm aiming at team size of 4-5.  Enough for creative problem solving, without too many arguments.  ~~So around £4 each.~~ Let's make it £5 for entry.  Any left over cash goes into the pot which will go for a round of drinks for the winning team.

The Clue Hunt we shall do is Bar Breaks.

http://www.inthehiddencity.com/bar-breaks/

It suits us the best I think.  One 30 minute and one 45 minute pub break during it.  If this does prove to be fun, we can always do another some other time.

(12 clues, average run time seems to be 2 hours even + 75 minutes of bar breaks, so average total time 3 hours 15 minutes)

We shall start at 2:30pm on the dot.  Meet up at 2pm in the National Gallery Cafe.  My mobile is Brad 07760389766.  If you ain't met me, I'm a 6 foot tall, brown Aussie bloke with a shaved head and glasses.  And I'm fairly adept at spotting newbies.  But just sms my number.

National Gallery, Trafalgar Square London, Greater London WC2N 5DN

I'll prob get there around 12 and wander around the National Gallery.  I love the National Gallery.  None of this modern art crap.  So ping me earlier if you want to join me.

So we should finish up by 6:30 pm or so.  Leaving time to do something in the evening.  I expect some of us will find a nearby bar for a few follow up drinks.

If you've never joined us before, please do.  This would be a great first event.  Teams will be randomly assigned.  You will roll a dice, and if that team isn't full be assigned to that.  So Team Natalie might not even have a Natalie on it....  Feel free to show up on the day, we can make the teams slightly bigger.  But telling me you're in now, allows me to add another team now.

I've been asked to photograph some fashion headgear for a friend's new online store.

We need to find a girl with nice hair that is okay being photographed outside wearing 'facinators', hair clips and the like.

I'll provide a packed lunch / picnic on the day and you'd get copies of the photos if you like what I've taken.

They'll be 3/4 rear shots, focussing on the headgear with some portrait shots also.
Eva (the designer) will talk to you about what to wear or provide clothes for you if she has something in your size.

There are no restrictions on your type, age or hair colour - the only requirement is that you feel comfortable being photographed outside with feathers and stuff in your hair.

We'd be out for 2 or so hours on a sunny day, probably in East London - the date to be set sometime in the next 4-6 weeks.

------------------

If you're interested, can you email a headshot to Mark:
flapcats (at) gmail.com

For reassurance that I'm not a crazy, PM any of the Kensington Rockaoke regulars (jaymeekay, kuuuma, therose80 for example) as they know me. 

Or maybe we've already met; I'm #143 on Amy's awesome [Global Meetup Video](http://youtu.be/jjuHpvnoNV0?t=1m22s).

I look forward to hearing from you.

[The Great British Beer Festival](http://gbbf.org.uk/) is a yearly event featuring lots of real ales, ciders, some fruit wines, some old-school pub games and good food (Boar/Ostrich burgers for example).

I've been to the last 2 at Earls Court, unlike the smaller festivals there is usually a decent range of beer on the last day - I've been able to try the festival winner both times. If we meet early we should be able to nab a table which is very useful.

Event runs 11am-7pm on the Saturday, we could head somewhere after. We'll be plastered though.

Tickets are £8, £6 for CAMRA members - if you're thinking of joining CAMRA I'd recommend doing so inside the festival for extras. Beers are usually very reasonably priced, the strong foreign ones will be a bit costly.

You can bring your own pint glass, or place a deposit on an event one when there (which you can keep) - beers are served in pints, 1/2s and 1/3s with no penalty on price for the smaller quantities - this allows you to try plenty of different beers and styles.

Non-beer drinkers are very welcome, I've been with some who usually enjoy trying the various fruit wines. There wont be much lager about, but the real beers are soo much better anyway. Well most of them.. there are always some shockers.

Any other questions, please ask!

&gt;Jonathan Haidt, the highly influential psychologist, is here to show us why we all find it so hard to get along. By examining where morality comes from, and why it is the defining characteristic of humans, Haidt will show why we cannot dismiss the views of others as mere stupidity or moral corruption. Our moral roots run much deeper than we realize. We are hardwired not just to be moral, but moralistic and self-righteous. From advertising to politics, morality influences all aspects of behaviour. It is the key to understanding everybody. It explains why some of us are liberals, others conservatives. It is often the difference between war and peace. It is also why we are the only species that will kill for an ideal.

&gt;Haidt argues we are always talking past each other because we are appealing to different moralities: it is not just about justice and fairness - for some people authority, sanctity or loyalty are more important. With new evidence from his own empirical research, Haidt will show it is possible to liberate us from the disputes that divide good people. We can either stick to comforting delusions about others, or learn some moral psychology. His hope is that ultimately we can cooperate with those whose morals differ from our own.

The Baker Street Irregular Astronomers meets in Regent Park for stargazing. They bring a few telescopes (and if you have one, bring it along) for looking at stars and chatting about Astronomy.  Last time I went there were about a dozen or so telescopes, including a few costing in the £10k+ range.

Here has better directions to get there:

http://bakerstreetastro.org.uk/info/location/

Basically near the zoo entrance at the northern end of Regents park there will be one gate open.  There are lights along the path and a few people walking back and forth so is fairly safe.  Also one of the amateur astronomers who helps organise the event is a copper.  The cafe is open for coffee, wine and beer.

The only way the event is cancelled is if it is pissing down rain at 6pm.  Otherwise if it's cloudy it will go ahead.  Last time was all overcast so all we did was target the telescopes at the BT tower and an apartment block nearby...  But I got to talk telescopes &amp; stars with people so I was happy :)

Kicks off at 6:30pm, but I'll be there from around 7:30pm.  Feel free to get there whenever, and if you're planning on getting early you can also be first point of contact if you so choose :)  But there are also a bunch of other non-reddit friendly people there who are all just looking to talk telescopes and stars.  (I ended up having a rather enjoyable conversation about mods and rockers with a 70 year old rider)

If work remains quiet and I skive off early, I'll drive in with my dog Charlie, so look for this fellow : http://i.imgur.com/0F2Sy.jpg

We’ll soon be instigating a new system for organising dates, which should drastically increase our chances of success!

**Planning**  
I suggest we meet at the Waterloo station around 10 in the morning on Sunday. The train tickets cost around £12.70 for an Anytime day return ticket to Martins Heron MAO.  
I'd recommend getting the tickets in advance.

Bicycle reservations are required, it seems, and can only be done over the phone. Going to call them and see what will happen if we just show up, or if there's a lot of us :)  
http://swt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2878/kw/cycle%20policy

If anyone here is not from London, we'll have to meet up there. We're probably going to be there around 11-12.  
If you'll be driving there, we can meet at the Look Out Discovery Centre here: http://g.co/maps/snvp9

**Bicycle hire**
If anyone needs to hire a bike there, they can hire one at the local center. The hire costs £13 for 2 hours + £2 fir every additional hour. If we spend there around 5 hours, it'd cost you £19, so that's not too bad :)  
more details here: http://www.wellingtontrek.co.uk/rates.php

**Weather update**  
Seems like it'll be around 15 degrees that day, and it might rain the night before, so some trails may be rather muddy... Take warm clothes, and be prepared :)

**21.30 - ???? @ [Cottons Rumshack](http://www.diffordsguide.com/london-cocktail-week/bars/cottons-restaurant-&amp;-rhum-shack-camden)**

We could add other bars along the way or skip any we don't like but the above should be a short walking distance from each other. 

Wristbands are required for the £4 Signature Cocktails on bars above, except Bar 55 where they're all cheap until 8pm. If you have registered but can't make it to Selfridges to pick it up, co-ordinate here as people going to get theirs could get it for others too.

Now wake up, other Londoners, we gotta bring the party to YOUR hoods too?

When?  Thursday 7th July, 7pm.  Post you're coming on here and I'll book us a table.

Where?

What is it?  Very good Caribbean food, also catering very well for vegetarians/vegans with good Ital dishes.  **It's BYOB so bring your own booze!**  No menu online, but it's typical Caribbean stuff - prices are reasonable (10-12 for a main, 15 for a platter I think?), however they do not take cards so be prepared.

I am staking my claim of LSC restaurant connoisseur on this, so I hope you will not be disappoint!  We can meet at Brixton at 6:45 and hold hands on the way there if you prefer.
Hope to see you there, all you people south of the river!

*** EDIT: The restaurant can fit 15 at that time indoors, so right now this is full.  IF however it's a nice evening, we can sit outside and fit a lot more in.  The first 15 who signed up are in, we will have to see closer to the time if we can get the outside as well, if the weather is good.***

So I propose we meet at 1pm at the McDonalds in Waterloo station, from there we will go to the [shitty museum](http://london.iwm.org.uk/) and then after that we can go to a shitty Sam Smith pub you all love so dearly.

Few points I'd like you all to read before any of you motherfuckers decide to sign up.

1.  This is a museum meet up. That means you should be interested in what we are going to see as it is quite long and in depth.

2. It takes about 3 hours to go around properly. Be prepared for this, I don't want to hear any bitching and complaining.

**3. There are only two points.**

I only put this here because of the fact we never got around to seeing anything at the science museum meets. This was due to lack of interest and conflict of interests.

    fross: That's bad. 
    troller: But you get a free glass of wine or pint of beer with your ticket!

Given the great response we got from people wanting to play dodgeball (in the dodgeball thread)[http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/fmkxx/official_dodgeball_thread/] and the number of people that have said that they can do the 18th I've booked the court at [T47](http://t47.co.uk/t47-sports-venue/) for 8pm. I don't know which court or which changing rooms we'll be using, so it might be best to meet outside / in the foyer before we get changed at 7.45ish to avoid asking strangers in the changing room if they'd like to play with our balls!

[T47](http://t47.co.uk/t47-sports-venue/) is located ""just 2 minutes walk from London Bridge"" [here](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=t47,+Southwark,+London+SE1+3QX,+UK&amp;aq=&amp;sll=51.503079,-0.084142&amp;sspn=0.006545,0.016265&amp;g=t47,+47+St.+Thomas+Street,+Southwark,+London+SE1+3QX,+UK&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=t47,&amp;hnear=London+SE1+3QX,+United+Kingdom&amp;ll=51.503854,-0.083706&amp;spn=0.006211,0.016265&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cid=1131381146364632448).

The total hire is £58 (£50 for the court, £8 for the balls), divided between the total number of players that turn up on the day - at the moment less than £6. I had to pay the deposit, so people will have to pay me back on the day either before or after the game.

**Edit**: We're at 18 at the moment and while I expect one or two people may drop out at the last minute due to un-forseen circumstances it looks like we'll be subbing people in/out during the game so that everyone gets to play. Whatever system we use we'll try to make it fair for everyone.

**Edit 2** Down to 15 players due to things coming up at the last minute. If anyone can't make it let me know.

I'LL BE THE TALL GUY WITH A NIKON D90.** 


Hi Everyone,

I'm going to be wandering around Central London tomorrow taking photos and I figure what better way than to do it with some fellow photogs from reddit. Here's a list of places I plan on hitting. I know it's a bit cliche but it's mostly the tourist stuff along the thames river. I'd love to have a London native that knows some places off the beaten path.

   * Big Ben
   * London Bridge
   * London Tower
   * Buckingham palace
   * St Paul's Cathedral
   * London Dungeon
   * St Jame's Park
   * The pirate ship 
   * Southwark Cathedral 

I'll be snapping pictures at the [Christmas meetup](http://redd.it/em6c5) tonight at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese. Be sure to come out if you can make it. I was thinking about meeting up around 11am and starting the photo walk about 11:30am. It looks like starting out at the London Bridge or Tower Hill underground station and working our way north along the river would be best. Also if any of the places mentioned above are not worth the time please do let me know.

FAQ

I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?

The majority of people who came along last week had never touched a game (spare the dreaded Monopoly). Come down, try it out and make some friends. Plus, you totally have beginner's luck on your side, which is excellent. Go for it!

I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones I'll be dominating this time?

Last week we had Cards Against Humanity, Fluxx, King of Tokyo, the Resistance and Settlers of Catan. This week I'm adding Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, the Games of Thrones Board Game. If you've got your own that you wish to crush us with (literally or figuratively), bring it along!

Do I need to bring in anything?

A few pounds/guineas/knuts/credits/groats for the barkeep to provide you with quenching ales, tonics and spirits.

Can I bring along some friends of mine?

The more the merrier. Literally. Bring as many as possible. Willing or not.

If you're coming, please do let us know in the comments. I'll PM remind you the evening before to give you a heads up.

It, like all of Camden Underworld's small band nights, is sure to have a great and laid back atmosphere (that is when we aren't breaking each others ribs in the pit), and all for Teenage cancer UK. Tickets are £10 and can be bought from [here](http://www.theunderworldcamden.co.uk/gigs/events/20-jul-13-headbangers-balls-feat-collapse-underworld/). Tickets should also be available on the door, but will most likely cost more so I highly recommend buying in advance.

There are a whole number of bands playing throughout the day, so here are some songs that should whet your appetites, in reverse order: 

XII Boar - [Smoking Bones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_Ye8YuWiQc), real solid doom metal that has won the band a spot on this years Bloodstock festival, the largest metal festival in the UK. You can also download these guys stuff for free [here](http://xiiboar.bandcamp.com/).

A Trust Unclean - [Cryogenic Slumber Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJiQNgXbjEA), pretty sweet groove/deathcore. This isn't really my personal taste, but from seeing bands similar to this in the past, there is no doubt they will put on a great show.

Reign Of Fury - [World Detonation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLpn7j8AeWw), these guys deserve a special mention for the fact that they are the ones responsible for the Headbangers Balls tour, pure, fast trash metal. This isn't even the full version of the song on the CD, which is even more awesome.

Gravil - [Enemy Within](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WrjhA5PpLQ), sweet tech death that is sure to open a pit.

L Sol Tace - [Army Of Darkness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfE8BHPjnUE) fantastic groove metal. 

Ancient Ascendant - [Driven By The Dark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwdcKWiFCnE), probably my favourite of the bands playing, and probably the buisiest in the London underground music scene. Fantastic and very trashy death metal. These guys were personally chosen by Bolt Thrower to tour with them, and have also toured with Enslaved. I have seen these guys before, and they put on a brilliant show.

Collapse -[Acolyte](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv1965gd4EQ), the headliners, fantastic thrash/death metal.

Right, now I've finished ranting about the bands, on to the serious stuff. The doors will open at 15:00, however I am not 100% sure if the bands will start instantly, sometimes there can be 20-30 minutes to get everyone in, sometimes they start straight away. XII Boar will be the first band on. I'm not sure how long the night will last for, previous gigs I have been to finish at different times.

The Camden Underworld is located behind the Worlds End Pub, directly opposite Camden High Street Station. It's pretty hard to miss, but just in case on the day I will put my number here so anyone who has any difficulty can call.

If you plan on drinking, there is a bar inside the Camden Underworld that has a pretty nice range of drinks to choose from. Smokers, there is no ""smoking area"", but you will be allowed to leave and be readmitted as much as you like, your wrists will be stamped on entry.

Anyone coming who has never been to an extreme music gig before or is not really acquainted with extreme music, the gigs can be daunting, but from my personal experience, having once been a newbie myself, the extreme music community is very welcoming.

I will hopefully be with a couple of mates, but my mates are the most unreliable bunch of people I have ever met, and cannot seem to make up their minds till the last goddamn minute. I will be going regardless, and drinking, though not too much. I have long hair and will be wearing a black band t shirt, you will get that joke if you go.

**IMPORTANT**: to my knowledge there is no wheelchair access to the Camden Underworld

Don't hesitate to ask questions, I hope I haven't left anything out, and I hope I will be seeing some of you there!

I'm finally back from my holiday and looking forward to another board game night! Sorry about the late notice.

If you're interested, post in the thread and come at 5.30 PM on Sunday June 9 to Oxfam bookshop on Kingston's Old London Road (near the fallen phone boxes).

FAQ

**I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?**

Sure, most times so far we have had somebody with no experience. Soon enough they get all excited and start watching YouTube videos and building up a collection of their own.

**I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones do you guys play?**

Depends on what people bring in. Usually it's stuff that can be grasped quickly and played within an hour or two: Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, Settlers of Catan.

**Do I need to bring in anything?**

We have tea and coffee in the shop as well as some biscuits, but I'd appreciate you bringing in some of your own.

**Can I bring along some friends of mine?**

Yeah, just let me know either in the thread, on mobile or via PM, so I know if I need to get any more tables/chairs in.

I try to send out PMs the night before to remind and check if anybody's changed their mind, so it's better to leave a reply here. You can come along either way, though.

Some people asked to move the pub to the one with a beer garden this week - it's still too early for it.. Even if it is warm at 7 it wouldn't be by 8:30-9ish, this would mean we'd be heading inside in the middle of a pub quiz - not ideal. 

Also, it's forecast to rain.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub, since that is a sensible place to meet and a pint is always good for stimulating conversation - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it!  
There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, people usually leave between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices and water.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

*""We have men, women, British, foreign (even a northerner or two,) gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers; and yes, there are even people who turn up that don't work in IT!"" - White667*

The staff have got good at remembering to reserve our tables.
If they are reserved it's the 2 long tables on the right as you enter - 1 with 'sofa benches' on 3 sides. This is the first table we sit at, we're usually spread across a couple of other nearby tables by the end of the evening.

I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me.

To save time I'll copy from zombiecommands's post.


&gt;The bar already has a pretty decent selection of board games available to play, including Catan, The Resistance, Gears of War, King of Tokyo, Resident Evil Deck Building Game, Battlestar Galactica, plenty of others. People can of course bring whatever they want to play themselves though.
&gt;
&gt;Video game wise they have Street fighter 4, Injustice, Tekken 6, Soul Calibur, Dead or Alive, a Snes with tons of games, and 2 Tabletop mame emulators with a few thousand roms on each.
&gt;
&gt;For those of you who just like to drink (you know who you are) there's also bottled beers at I think £2.50, cocktails both from MADD and video game themed 'power-up' cocktails. There's also a good selection of coffees and fruit drinks.

It's £12 to sign up, including shoe hire and use of a locker, and you can do that when you arrive. They've also got full changing facilities, so don't worry about having to wear your climbing gear there/back.

I will be arriving into London from Brisbane at stupid o'clock in the morning and know that if I don't make daytime plans I will go straight to bed on arrival and make my body clock confused and upset. 

So I am hoping that some of you lovely people would be willing to engage in daytime activities so I don't fall into a coma and wake up confused and horrified at 10 pm. Being new to London, I am open to suggestions as to what to do. Current thoughts include Natural History Museum, Science Museum or just wandering about in a jet-lagged daze before/after consuming beer. If those suggestions don't appeal I also like eating, and talking and looking at stuff. 

I am (I think!) fun and nice and don't bite or anything! Hopefully if I am not close to death after a day of trying to stay awake I will be able to come to the pub crawl.

The country's sole remaining owners of print copies of Reader's Digest descend upon a dusty community hall for their regular excursion into the world of coffin-dodging interaction. Each one staring over the rims of prescription glasses at their sheets, blotters at the ready between mangled, arthritic digits. The monotony of the bingo caller's voice -- usually misheard by the cloth-eared audience -- is punctuated only by the occasional creaky kneecap or bout of angina. Sometimes the tension and excitement of looking for a number on a sheet of paper prove too exhausting; fortunately, reasonably-priced tea, barley water and Hobnobs are available in the canteen.

This is happening somewhere else. Like Taunton or Dunstable.

Do you like dancing, drinking, cheering, and the slim possibility of winning novelty, party-enhancing prizes? Do you not mind losing a few layers of clothing, and/or having people scrawl cock and in-jokes on the side of your neck? Are you accustomed to getting strange looks on the night bus? Then you're in the right place. No, not Taunton, but Rebel Bingo. If you're still none the wiser, watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2femIWQ1ng).

It also has all the key information you'll need.

First, anyone is welcome to join this crawl. Also, feel free to join even if you don't plan on drinking or only plan on drinking at some of the pubs. For, those who want to attempt a drink at each pub it is strongly recommended that you stick to half pints or single shots. Keep in mind that we will not be staying at any pub very long, so order accordingly.

On that note, people are also welcome to join the crawl part way through, but I can't guarantee where we will be at any given time. I have provided a rough estimate below, but please phone me to find out for sure (I'll post my number closer to the crawl/additional contact numbers). Finally, when confirming below can you mention whether or not you'll be at the start. Just want to get an idea about numbers.

**When:** Friday January 11, 2013. 10:50am start time at King's Cross O'Neills.

**What you'll need:** An oyster card with at least £8 on it or a Zone 1 all day travel card. At least £50 if you plan on drinking at all pubs and getting a bite to eat. A strong liver (if drinking). 

**Charitable Donation:** Also I'm asking each full participant to [donate £10 to support Bowel Cancer UK via JustGiving](http://justgiving.com/randomlylondon). If you're coming for part of the time £5 is fine. Please of course give more if you can afford it. (For more see FAQ)

**FAQ**

**Q:** Why is this held on a Friday and not a Saturday?

**A:** The circle line pub crawl is almost impossible to do on a Saturday due to the number of pubs closed in The City. Friday is the next best option.

**Q:** Why aren't we doing the Hammersmith Branch?

**A:** In 2009 the Circle Line stopped being an actual circle. However, trying to add in the extra stations on the Hammersmith branch would make what is a difficult - yet achievable - pub crawl into an impossible one.  We'll just stick to Circle Line classic for this one.

**Q:** Is there any walking involved?

**A:** My original plan was to walk the whole route myself (along with anyone else who wished to join me) and have everyone else go by tube. This was an idiotic idea. Trying to coordinate two groups would be next to impossible given the level of drinking. Instead we'll likely walk between some stations as it can be faster than taking the Tube in certain situations (e.g. Monument, Cannon Street and Mansion House). 

**Q:** Will you make long winded speeches about the tube?

**A:** Only if you misbehave (or want me too).

**Q:** Is there anything I can do to help?

**A:** Thanks for asking and yes there is. If you're coming along for the whole thing I'm asking that you [make a £10 donation towards my Tube Challenge for Bowel Cancer UK](http://justgiving.com/randomlylondon) (£5 if joining part-way through). In a recent r/LSC survey people said they wanted to be more charitable, so here's your chance.

It's not mandatory, but if you can afford the £50-60 pounds the day will cost in terms of booze and food, I don't think an extra £10 will kill you. Plus my work is matching all donations 100% (up to £600). If you can afford/feel like giving more please do.  

I've picked this charity because both my grandparents on my Dad’s side of the family died from Bowel Cancer, my grandmother in her 40s. It’s an entirely treatable disease if caught early enough and Bowel Cancer UK helps raise awareness. 

Finally, I also need a few people to provide additional contact numbers. I get really shit with picking up my phone once drinking, so we can use as many other contact points as possible. 

**Edit 1:** Contact Numbers: Me (Ian) zero-78-zero-67-zero-953-zero, Kaer (Brad): zero-776-zero-3897-six-six, Blah_Blah_Blag - zero783zero2975nine3, Lawrence - zero7747 3two774nine

**Edit 2:** Some of us will be getting to O’Neills at 10:15am for a fry-up. If you’re interested please feel free to join us. If you haven’t already donated but would like to you have two options: 1) Visit http://www.justgiving.com/randomlylondon/ and donate there (my preferred option) 2) Give me cash on the day of, I’ll keep a record. 

**Edit 3:** Thanks for everyone who came out. The same 3 who did the whole one the first time, were the same 3 to complete this one. Lawrence should get an award for making it back out.

There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, others come whenever they can, I generally drink 2-3 pints and leave at 10ish since I get up for work on Tuesdays. Others tend to leave between then and closing. On average we're currently getting 8-12 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 20ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meetup is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly*

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**FILM**

Goblin Market
21.00-21.30
Clore Auditorium
Free but ticketed
Goblin Market is the first live action film adaptation of Christina Rossetti’s poem. Directed by award winning filmmaker, Anna Blandford, the film was part funded by sponsorship from the Telegraph newspaper.
Sister of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Christina was strongly associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement; modelling for her brother and other members of the brotherhood. Dante composed the original illustrations for Goblin Market.
Like the original poem, this film adaptation is a vivid and distinctive coming of age story, whilst woven into the fabric of its narrative is a more complex symbolism and meaning. It is designed to look like a Pre-Raphaelite painting, feel like a dream and capture the imagination like a fantasy fairy tale.
Set in rural Victorian England, Goblin Market focuses on the natural world, in a similar way to the Pre-Raphaelite artists. In contrast to the painters she associated with, Christina Rossetti’s interpretation of nature presents it as a dark and unknowable force. This film adaptation is true to the ambiguous sexual intrigue that enriches the poem and which has fascinated readers for over a century.
Directed by Anna Blandford. 
Written by Anna Blandford, Anna Valdez Hanks.

Bed Peace for Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde*
David Mabb
18.00-21.30
In the display cabinet to the right of the William Morris Bed there is a small pamphlet called Chants for Socialists published by the Socialist League in 1885. In it Morris “provided fiery new words to well-known popular songs and hymns: accessibility and familiarity were more important than musical originality”.  Morris’ radical socialism and disenchantment with parliamentary politics developed from his opposition to the Tories’ support for Turkey’s war against Russian Tsarist forces in the late 1870s and the eventual betrayal of the anti-war movement by the Liberals especially when they returned to office in 1880.

John Lennon’s and Yoko Ono’s ‘Bed In’ (1969) was one of the most significant (public) events that took place in a bed during the last century. John and Yoko spent many days in bed in several cities during their honeymoon as a protest against the Vietnam War. As well as having a constant stream of visitors and conducting many interviews, they performed ‘Give Peace a Chance’ a simple and repetitive song written by Lennon, which became the sing-along ‘chant’ of the peace movement.

In Bed Peace, a video of John and Yoko in bed singing ‘Give Peace a Chance’ is to be projected onto the headboard of the ‘Morris Bed’. It is intended that the video and the sound track will run for just under five minutes. When finished, a silent projection of the two posters which John and Yoko had above their bed in the ‘Bed In’ ‘Hair Peace’ and ‘Bed Peace’, will be projected onto the headboard for five minutes. The video would then start again.

The work is a posthumous collaboration between William Morris, John Lennon and Yoko Ono.",,False,,t5_2s87x,1354887372.0,,NO,True,t3_14clvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/14clvl/071212_pre_raphaelites_late_at_tate_britain/,

I sat at my desk, trying to work through an essay, and my eyes wondered to reddit. A thread came onto me that showed Halloween cakes of all shapes and sizes, many colours, and many flavours. Inspired by this sight, I made it my life's goal to bring these pictures into my life. So the Halloween cake contest was born.
******************

**How to Enter**

It really couldn't be simpler. Bring cake to the[ Halloween Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/11u7fg/31112_reminder_halloween/). Over the evening people will *upvote* the cakes they like, based on taste and style. The winner is the person with the most upvotes at 10PM. The winner will be awarded a wonderful trophy, I will buy them a free drink, and will receive **eternal glory**. **ETERNAL GLORY**. 

******************
**Top Tips**



* The Contest will run from 7:00 to 9:00
* Please bring a little sign with; ~~your name (reddit and real life)~~, whether or not your cake contains nuts/alcohol (and yes that is a suggestion), and if you so wish the name of your creation. I will have paper and pens there if you need to make the sign.
* If you bring the cake earlier, more people will be able to eat and vote on it. 
* This is a contest, but most importantly it is a chance to do what we all love, eat some cake. 
* Though this is called a cake contest, any spooky dessert will be celebrated here. I am just not very good with names. 
* Everyone who votes is expected to eat some of each cake. So you will need to bring a large amount of cake, I would suggest enough for 10 standard servings, or greater. Also bring knives to that we can cut said cakes without cross contamination. 
* That reminds me that I should buy some napkins.
