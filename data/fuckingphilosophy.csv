Theses guys are like, aint nothing wrong wit having freewill AND fatalism. Matter fact niggas need fatalism to have free will. I read that shit, and I was like DAWG, but that's what I always be saying, doh. 

See whenever bros be talking bout freewill, you gotta be like freedom from what? I be hearing all these dumb fools saying quantum randomness* give them freewill and shit and I'm like Bitch, lemme school you. Randomness aint freewill. That be like when Two Face flip a coin stead of making his own damn mind. You either a slave to cause and effect or you a slave to the coin. But being a slave to cause and effect aint really being a slave cause you ARE cause and effect.

Lemme put this shit in your head. Say I axe you what you'd do if some punk ass fool start mackin on your bitch. Your like, ""I'd beat his punk ass."" After I axe you that, some punk ass fool does start mackin on your bitch. Wha'ya gon do. You gonna do what you said. You gonna beat his beat his ass, cause thats what you be about. Thats who you are.

Why do you do the shit you do? Cause what choice you'd make in a given scene be central to who and what YOU are. And what YOU are is your memories and hardwiring. If you do what you do cause shits all random, it aint you whose calling the shots, it's the coin.

What the fuck a choice anyway? A jellyfish ain't got no choice. They do all that jelly shit they do cause they got preprogrammed responses to external stimuli. We got choice cause are brains are all complex and shit. Your head be so complex you can have two opposing ideas at the same time. That's why brothas need consciousness to mediate. When a bro use his PRIORITIES to curb one idea that don't sit with another, he be making a choice. But where'd all these priorities come from? It all boils down to shit you've learned and shit your wired to want. Erbody knows that shit. It don't take no damn philosopher.

Fatalism be the only way that you can be you, and have your own nature. There's a bro called YOU who be the only bro that's seen the shit you seen and thought the shit you thought and knows the shit shit you know. More importantly, you the only one whose done the shit you done and would do the shit you'd do. If shit was all random, then ""what would you do,"" a question central to a bros character, wouldn't even make sense. How the fuck would you know what you'd do? That's for the coin to decide. 

And don't forget, while the environment act on you, you act on the environment. Shit goes both ways. You fill a niche in Universe. The Universe a puzzle and you a piece. Without you the puzzle aint whole and shit dont fit together. So don't deny your roll and your nature and try to be all above it and shit. Be glad you is you.

*Quantum physics aint random. Copenhagen be for hoes and tricks.

Needless to say my mind is blown, so he gave some tips:

1) Fuckin define yo terms: People dont know whatchu talkin bout and they dont wanna figure it out! What you say has a million fucking meanings and they don't wanna guess so spell it out! If you writing a fucking paper on, i dont know, fuckin happiness or some shit, you gotta tell people what you mean by happiness or they might think you fuckin crazy!

2) Tell niggas what you gonna do! When that ""thesis"" thing happens, make it clear. Tell people in your paper ""ima do this, then ima do this, and then im gonna tell you fuck all."" So people dont gotta read your whole damn paper befo' they realize its shit.

3) Be fair to your opponents. Yeah i know, this is stupid shit, but if you want to make an argument, the last thing you want your enemy to do is not read your paper right? Tell the niggas that they have some stuff right, know what they think and write it down so they can agree wit you. If you do that, bitches cant do nothin when you pop a cap in their asses.

4) Cite your sources: once more, bullshit right? Fuck bibliographies! You gotta do it tho bro, if you write a paper and you got all yo info from some bitch ass nigga dont know what all hes talkin bout, were gonna have a problem.

Or at least cracked it wide open.

But you know what really bothers me here? It's that everyone makes such an attempt to ""ghetto"" up their language they make a total mess of what they were trying to say.

The whole point here is to explore bro-losophy. That means shit that needs to be said without some academic fuckwad coming in and fucking it up with his pretentiousness. Shit that you can't say without *fucking saying it* they way it needs to be fucking said, with all the goddamn language you need to say it in.

Shit that if you say it the way you **goddamn well please** and you know for a fucking fact that this shit is fucking meaningful, then you're much more fucking likely to make a point, and that is **fucking valuable**.

If this is just a subreddit to wax racist/sexist for no fucking reason other than the fact that you like to hear your own voice and think you're so fucking eloquent or so fucking funny that you just have to stop jacking off to double anal penetration videos so you can come in here and jack off all over the rest of us, then **fuck you I'm out**. I am here to discuss brolosophy not to jack off.

Let me put it this way: On a scale from /r/fuckingphilosophy to /r/philosophy I want to be somewhere in the middle.

It's the same shit as those clowns over in /r/science and /r/askscience... NO FUN ALLOWED... you don't have a PhD your comment is BANNED! No, FUCK YOU PEOPLE I want to discuss science without some faggot science-nazi shitting all over my discussion. What the fuck is wrong with people sometimes?

If an internal monitor detects any radioactivity, the muthafuckin' flask shatters and kills the cat. Apparently, the odds of that happening are the fucking same as the monitor not detecting radioactivity, which would keep the shithead cat alive (this shit don't even account for the cat's other 8 lives).


What's giving me head pains is that some bullshit science equation says that the cat is alive and dead *at the same time*! Yet if some nigga from down the block comes along and opens the damn box up, the cat will be either dead *or* alive! How da fuck can something be alive and dead?

They don't have language, they don't feel all the weird and shitty eddies of social living that I do (and basically every human does), they just cluck and look for food and sometimes puff their feathers and look all big. Anyway, I'm just wondering what ya'll think about what it's like to be a chicken, to live without language and a memory like we have. 

I feel the phenomology of animals is more similar to ours than we usually admit. When you see an animal in distress, I think it's best to assume that it is feeling pain and suffering in a way similar to the way that you'd feel pain and suffering in an analogous situation; we give other people that benefit of the doubt, and animals (with their large brains etc.) are the closest physical systems to us, so why make the distinction? 

So I think chickens have objects. What I mean is, they see the world as made of discrete things that persist in their experience, even if they aren't really seeing them right now. Take this crazyass chicken I was watching the other day. She was trying to get some food under they hay near her, so she was looking all around for the food. Then she walks forward to where she was looking, kicks all the hay away, walks back and looks again, finds the food, and eats it. This takes a concept of space (I would think) very similar to ours, and also an object 'food' that she would want say maybe with hunger or that nameless craving you get when it's 2am and your drunk and there's still that shitty burrito place open that you love and you're not hungry but why the fuck not. Not all our experiences can or are put into language, so if we look at how those experiences feel to us, I feel like we can get a better idea of how a chicken would feel, not having language, in a chickeny situation that was similar. 

But a chicken doesn't have words for food, and could never tell another chicken ""Yo dude, that half eaten apple was the shit. I fucking love half eaten apples, shit's my jam"", so what do they feel, or how can we talk about what they feel if it cannot be talked about by the person feeling that feel. We can definitely look at how they act and make analogy to how we feel when we act like that, but we also have language, so when we feel sadness, we conceptualize that feeling as sadness as we are feeling it. Would a chicken feel sad if it can't know it's feeling sad?

No fucker, you can't! Stop being a Kant!

""Sure you can!"" Says smug asshat, ""A circle is just the path of points all equal in distance from a set point. A square is any figure with 4 equal sides and right angles. Shit's all definitions. You can learn that shit before hand.""

Hey shit-for-brains, I don't know how you were brought up, but I and everyone else I know didn't just freakin' learn about fucking shapes simply from my parents telling me what a fucking circle or triangle was. I had to actually see and feel and experience that shit before I even learned the rules and definitions of simple shit like triangles! How the fuck do you even explain the concept of angles and lines and points and shit to a two year old!? Raise your hand if you learned the definition of a triangle before you seen a triangle... Yeah that's right, sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up!

""No fuck you!"" yells out shit-for-brains, ""We can come up with knowledge and shit based on definitions from previous experiences! See! A prior up in this shit!""

Oh really? And how is that any different from a guess? Are guesses and hunches now knowlegde? That shit's nothing but an inference based on facts. Sometimes that shit comes out true, others it gets all weird and shit and we need to go back and triple check that shit. Either way, that shit isn't known until you experience the conclusion. It's only until a logician or mathematician finishes their bitch ass long series of operations does that fucker learn some -if any- knowledge. In fact, how can some fucker know something before experiencing that knowledge? The fuck does it even mean to know some shit before you experience learning that shit? 

""Okay bro, I get where you're coming from, but what shit like the supernatural and God and fuck, I don't know!""

Before I answer, just one thing. Fuck the idea of a ***super***natural. ""Above"" nature? You mind as well say ***super***reality, because as far as I see it, nature is the same thing as reality. The fuck is being *above* reality? Why even say something exists above nature and then stop there and not explain why they're different? Fuck whoever thought of that idea. Fuck dat shit. Fuck. Dat.

Now with that out of the way, if that shit exists (which I'm sure it doesn't), then it has to have some damn effect on our plane of existence before you can even talk about you know it exists, otherwise you're just pulling shit out of your ass like some fuckhead. And if that shit does effect our shit, it's open to scientific inquiry. All of it. So fuck you!

""Hey man, but what if God and shit doesn't interact with stuff around us?""

Then why the fuck are you even talking about it? Don't tell me you still believe even though you don't know. It's not like you could *know* if any of it exists. Unless it does interact in some way with us, you're just making shit up or just repeating shit someone told you. How the fuck can you talk about someshit when there's no indication may even exists in the slightest? How is that knowlegde? Fuck, what is this, String Theory? If you have proof of that shit, go get it tested out by trained sciencey professional fuckers and receive your prize, otherwise shut the fuck up.

Check it.

Anyone who spends any fucking time on the internet probably runs across some amount of social progressive shit, to a degree that you don't really run into in the real world, at least not if you're from the US of Murrica like myself. Feminist shit, anti-racist shit, pro-gay shit, and all kinds of shit like that. And to me it makes fucking sense. And I don't even mean the obvious shit, like equal rights and whatnot. I mean advanced goddamn concepts, like the existence of rape culture, intersectionality, the patriarchy, all that shit. Not to mention categories of oppression that no one fucking thinks of, like that of fat people, trans people, disabled people, et fucking al. To straight white male me, this is some eye-opening shit. Apparently for a lot of fuckers out there, shit is real to an extent I had not realized. (Sorry I didn't drop more detail on you mofos; I'd in all likelihood fuck it up. But hopefully you know what I'm babbling about).

Okay, so progressivism. Fuckin' A. Abortion rights, affirmative action, gay marriage, Obamacare, new pronouns, better sex ed, trans rights, worker's rights, and the end of the war on drugs. All that shit. Good. Why the fuck not.

And there's one other thing they say, which, at first, makes total fucking sense:

&gt; The personal is political.

Meaning, as far as my ignorant ass can make out, that there is no bright line between personal shit and political shit; it's all actually the same. Which, no shit, because politics is about people after all, not about planets or ducks or whatever the fuck else. Again, 10 fucking 4.

**But here's the punchline, motherfuckers.** It turns out that the course of navigating real life as an adult, a bro's gotta adopt some implicitly right-wing attitudes just to survive the goddamn day and avoid turning into a worthless sack of shit. E.g., doing your job right and being professional and shit are actually kind of goddamn important. If your ass gotta be at work at 8am, and your lived experience is that you don't like getting up in the morning, well fuck you, cause your next lived experience is you're gonna be fired if you don't get your ass moving. Nobody gives a fuck how you feel, it just matters what you do. But it balances out, cuz maybe trying to be actually fucking useful to other homies makes you a better homie, plus you gets paid. And that doesn't seem like a totally fucked-up thing. Now all this is some cold-ass conservative shit, but it's the truth. And maybe I'm missing something, but there is just no fucking space in liberal-world for that idea. They hear ""hard work and personal responsibility"" and get all goddamn derisive and sarcastic. And understandably so, cuz 99% of the time if some fucker's saying ""hard work and personal responsibility"" on TV, he's a fucking asshole. But so fucking what, cuz in reality, most adults gotta be down with HW&amp;PR to some extent just to keep the fuckin' Earth in orbit.

There's all kinds of other shit like that, not just with working and shit but with everything. Bottom line is, a motherfucker's gotta be able to take care of zir shit, and zie can't go cryin' to somebody else every time zie doesn't get what zie wants. Not to mention, as much as we all hate the shit out of tradition, guess what, the world is a lot older than you, and people in the past probably figured out some shit that you need to know now. Ignore at your peril, mofo.

And to do all this it's tremendously fucking helpful to have the idea that it's your *job* to be that way, not that it's just some arbitrary burden the man's trying to lay on you. If you start thinking that way, all you accomplish is you end up a resentful, entitled, miserable asshole, and I don't think even the feminist bloggers want to be bros with a mofo like that. And how exactly is that mofo helping the fucking cause anyway? Beats the shit otta me.

I'll try and wrap this fucking tome of a post up. Basically, my problem is this:

1. Social progressivism is trying to put a stop to some real fucked up shit, so, fuck yeah social progressivism.

2. Progressivism includes the idea (""The personal is political"") that being a progressive is not just a set of ideas about shit far away, it's gotta absorb your whole fucking approach to life.

3. But to live life effectively, a mofo oftentimes has to work hard, take responsibility for his own mistakes, delay gratification, learn from tradition, and generally right-wing it up all over this bitch.

Respect. From homie to homie yo.

Second thing I'm gonna say brah, shit sorry y'all for the length of this post, cause this gonna be one motherfucking long winded motherfucking post, but hear me out yo.

So I be thinking, am I just physical processes? What is the I that each bro calls his ass? I spit Self with a capital ""s"" but hell, why should we be pimping that word yo, treating it like it's something bigger than Jay-Z's last album, it's just a self, nothing special. We bros just think it's special because we be some wack ass egotistic motherfuckers.

So I be thinking, what is the difference between the shit that's going on in my brain and other purely physical shit, like lightning, electricity, chemical reactions yo. Am I just physical processes?

Be yourself? What the fuck is with that? What does that even mean bro? I mean this is some kinda fucked up shit to think about.

Example. I was listening to a dope ass track, where the MC be rappin, ""Dig, I'll be there with you always"". But that homie be rottin in his grave now. So I was thinkin, tough shit homie, you lost. But then I sat down and chilled the fuck out and thought, well what if the self is something higher than what we can dig? Something emergent, super-physical, not directly observable by scientific methods but very real, and maybe more permanent than this fucked up shit we call the world.

But then yo, I kinda lost the faith bro. And that's why I say self with a small ""s"" now. Because now I'm thinkin well this is just an illusion, a very well fabricated one, possibly the best motherfuckin magician we will ever know is nature herself. Yo that bitch is pimpin, she could put that Houdini punk to shame. So here we all are thinkin we be individual agents, a macroscopic ""person"", but actually we be no more than microprocesses 'n shit. I mean how do the billion processes happening right now in my body make me feel sensation, emotion, think, and have a personality?

for sartre, our possibilities are our reality. possibilities appear to us and we are free to choose any of them. nothing compels us to adopt any one possibility over another we are completely free, but we must choose. the ""i"" that i am is merely chosen by me, and is one of many attitudes i can take towards things. any attitude is just another thing that we encounter in being-- hoooooooly shit!

im just thinking to myself like this shit is deep as FUCK, like astonishingly deep. to really apply this shit to my own conscious experience was to very strongly feel the freedom that i truly have to choose any possible action that comes to my mind. it really just hit me like a ton of fucking bricks to the mind. but what is the mind really though amirite jk.

Nah, I'm talking bout at least having a decent idea of what's going on, mang. I was perplexed to know that my homeboy J-Dogg had no idea who Kim Jong-Il was when his death was on the news. Even more perplexing was how I felt *irrationally offended* by this. Da fuck?! Where did this shit come from, nahmean?

Syria, Greece, SOPA. My take is that niggas must be informed yo, independently of its degree of effect on us, but I can't really tell why. Spit some knowledge and help a brother out.

*Edit: Yo big ups to all ma homies who have taken their time to input their thoughts. Dunno if the Kim JI example was the best one, but it was a IRL example that did actually bother me, nahmean?

1340082672.0,27,self.fuckingphilosophy,v9hc8,"What makes words like ""fucking"" and ""bitch"" offensive? How would Derrida deconstruct this shit? ",PimpinTheLibrary,32,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingphilosophy/comments/v9hc8/what_makes_words_like_fucking_and_bitch_offensive/,"so this is my first post and i've been thinking about my boi Derridawg, and fucking swear words, how do they work? Here's what i thought:

So when we use language we divide the meaning into two parts, literal meaning/propositional content and style. For example: the formula “Brethren prior to wenches!” has the same propositional content as “Bros before Hoes”, however, the difference between the information received in the first and second versions seems almost more important than the literal meaning, and this difference is style. The literal meaning is everything that represents the conditions of satisfaction (for all my speech act theorist bitches). Swear words place a lot of emphasis on the style aspect.
This is where my nigga Derridawg comes in. We understand swear words in their relations with their non-offensive synonyms. ""Shit"" is linked with ""excrement"", but differs from ""excrement"" so the offensiveness is not internal to the word itself, it is ""deferred"" to its relations with other words. 
Language-using bros like us also try to hook up the signifier with the fucking signified. But swear words, man, that shit's different: When the word “shit” is used, the signifier is in fact a presence that stands in for the absent piece of excrement. However, the offensive nature is fully present: the offensiveness is there simply by using the word: there is no absent thing being referred to. The presence-absence opposition thus does not function in this case. 
But that's not all, man: this is a case of the Possible-Impossible Aporias that Derrida spoke of: the condition of possibility is identical tothe condition of impossibility. The offensiveness linked with fucking swear words is possible only because the swear words have some extra shit to them beyond the propositional content; otherwise offensiveness would be limited to what was literally being said. However, this is the exact same reason why it is impossible for swear words to be offensive: one gets offended when one is made to feel less valuable as a person, but when swear words are used for their offensive nature alone, they aren’t communicating any information (any propositional content) that would give any reason to suppose that the person is devalued, noamsayin?. Thus we have an uncertainty with regards to whether it is truly possible for swear words to be offensive.  The ""offensiveness"" of words like ""fuck"" and ""bitch"" exists, it's just unstable as fuck.


Anyway, I have more to say about this, but i don't want it to be tl;dr (as it already is, sorry guys), is dis shit legit? or is there another way fucking swear words work, (or don't)?

Lacan thinks that we (unconsciously) desire shit, but we don't have access to said shit  thanks to that motherfucker the Symbolic Law. So the best we can do is cling to the *objet petit a*, a little leftover of the Real Object that sort of represents the whole thing we desire, like a beautiful piece of hair that we love because it represents the smokin hot bitch that it belongs to.

Skrillex, that clever bastard, found a way to isolate the *objet petit a*. Here, give this shit a listen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR6AV9yJPoM .  What we desire is the Real pysche behind the voice we hear, but (in normal life) the Symbolic of the words get in the fucking way. Skrillex, using his electronic-ass wizardry, took all the Symbolic out of it, leaving nothing but the leftover Real of the voice, with all its emotion and shit; it still sounds like there's some words up in this bitch, they just can't be understood. What we hear is nothing but the *objet petit a*. We don't get what we desire (because it's impossible for Lacan), just a little piece of it. This just-barely-beyond-comprehensible human voice is different from ""Lalala"" type singing because we feel like something is beyond it, just like the desired Real Thing is beyond the *objet petit a*; for ""Lalala"" there is nothing beyond it. 

Anyway, that's what i got, is this what that bro Lacan means by the *objet petit a*, or should i look for it somewhere else?

First of all, straight up, ""nothing"" is in quotes so you don't think I'm saying nothing is impossible ie no thing is impossible ie everything is possible. I'm talking about ""nothing"" or nothingness or that thing-that-isn't-a-thing you know what I'm saying. Like we hear this bullshit all the time: 

""Physicists are finding out why there's something instead of nothing, they're such fucking geniuses""

I'm talking about that kind of ""nothing"" (I'm keeping with the quotes motherfucker). So I gots to thinking and here's a little 'proof' or some shit about why ""nothing"" ain't no thing. 

So let's say ""nothing"" means ""having no properties"" because shit, ""nothing"" can't have any properties. I mean, if it did, it'd be fucking something. So lets call the set of all properties P. [as I'm writing this I think I've begged the question but hold up] So then ""nothing"" is the statement (for every p in P)(~p(x)) for some fucking x. So, x is nothing because it has no properties, right, and so this statement is always true. Now we got my bro p'(a), which is the statement ""(for every p in P)(~p(a)) for some fucking a"". Obviously p'(a) is a property, so substitute that shit in and you get ~(~p(x)) for some fucking x, which is p(x). This shit contradicts that other shit, and so ""nothing"" ain't no thing. 

This is all easy bullshit 'cos obviously x has the property ""is 'nothing'"" and to have a property, x has to be something which can have properties, so it ain't ""nothing"". 

Maybe this is all me begging the question (like, by assuming x as an object which is obviously not nothing in the first place), but I wanna see what you think about it and ""Nothing"" in general.

Emergence is the shit.  The root of the problem is time though.  We really don't understand time very well.  Everything that is exists with in time.  I mean that in the most philosophic terms.  Nothing I can experience is outside time.  Time is completely  interwoven with our consciousness.  For me to move from one thought to another the chemistry in my brain needs time to run.  My conscious thought moves forward.  It can't be reduced any further than that, but still we have no explanation for why time moves forwards and not backwards.

If that's the problem then happiness freaks are just that, freaks.

However I got an idea, why not suppose people can only be sooo happy, or that their is an intrinsic maximum to happiness.  In other words happiness is like northness, you can only get so north.  Try to go more and you get your ass turned around no matter what.

Now we don't have to worry about some utility monster which'll transform shit into happiness better than any of the bros, keeping the bros shitless.  I mean man that can't be right that we can't have shit?

So the video is of Mark Cuban throwing away energy bracelets shaming the NBA for selling them.  For those that don't know energy bracelets basically work via the placebo affect.  An advertiser sells a regular plastic bracelet and says, ""If you wear me you will have more energy."" 

Two scenarios:
1)
A conventional idiot that actually does not know about the placebo affect wears the bracelet, if they think they have more energy they think it worked, if they think they didn't have more energy they think it doesn't.

2)
What fucks me up with this, is that if a person wears an 'energy bracelet' , knowing that it is worthless but wants to remind himself that he wants to gain more energy.  Does the thought processes itself facilitate a self-fulfilling prophecy that leads to change?

I guess at the end of the day if you just have something reminding you  to do something and you do it you are more likely to be doing it.  So is the bracelet just a microcosm of planning out an aspect of your life?

I guess what I am really asking is, ""How much do symbols effect our lives and how we act?  and if we surround ourselves by different types of symbols are different actions more easily facilitated?""  Which if true would mean that the useless bracelet might be worth more than nothing.

Now here me out, I know its all about refuting that shit. So behavioralism is all about the external, the intersubjective, the fucking object if you will. What a person is doing is his mental state. So to determine consciousness or any theory of consciousness we gotta look at actions, otherwise we're just talking bullshit. Bullshit is fucked up so we can't talk shit about expierence. 

To me that's behaviorlism, and so I can determined scientific (or psuedoscientific fuckin whatever) facts about myself by watching myself do, actually do things/ say things in the world. But wait a fuckin second, cos I have to watch myself do things. Be cognizant of my doing things, and then act on it. So of course Behavioralism's all like, shit man when you act on that, you've fuckin realized it of course. But i'm all nah man, you can't explain my experience, and my possible transmission of an analog of that expeierence though language, so what the fuck was that. So behavioralism posits a fuckin observer right, a me to see all that shit that i could theoretically disect and categorize and conceptualize. This observer, me right, doesn't act on the same behavioral rules as the self I experience acting (or others and shit) , and so if considered like a substance, would act on different 'laws'. Well that's fuckin Cartesian dualism motherfucker, with body being the accepted material world where behavior happens and with mind being that which observes all that shit.

So my question to behavioralists is straight: How do you explain consciousness, and how do you refute ideas of material consciousness (other than the 'identity theory' which is all ""brain  are ACTUALLY fuckin conscious states"", like, with no difference"")?

I often find myself feeling in the mood for high-brow conversation when drunk.

It is silly but It is innately  human. 

My question to reddit (and quite frankly everyone) Is this an aspect of humanity? the need for intellectual debate or is this a particular quirk of mine? If so do any others feel my imperative?

Background
The first thing I would like to say is that I am not trying to convert anyone. Everything that follows is simply my view on the topic. I consider myself a person who ponders the meaning and existence of life quite a bit. I would say more than others, but without the ability to read people’s minds this statement is unverified. I am by nature a fairly logical person (hence the Computer Science degree) and a natural born researcher. 

I had the wonderful opportunity to grow up in a family that had very loose religious ties. My parents never forced me into a particular religion besides requiring me to go to a Christian elementary school and a Mennonite middle school. Besides school I was never required to go to church or participate in other religious activities if I did not want to. When high school came around my parents moved me to a public school. At first I was very nervous, but looking back now I am very grateful for this opportunity as it opened my mind to many different world views that I was never introduced to before. I was a strong believer in the Christian faith, but by the time I had reached sophomore status I had been subjected to a multitude of religions and views such as Agnosticism and Atheism. 

Logically, my own beliefs seemed to break down as I saw the merits of other’s posed to me.  I was confused; I now had friends who were Mormon, Jewish, Agnostic, Atheist, and Unitarian alongside my Christian friends. My only solution was to research everything, but the more I researched the more I realized that each belief was presented as fact. I scratched my head wondering how these contradictions were possible. It just didn’t add up! Unable to determine anything useful from the slew of ideologies I finally settled on Agnosticism. There seemed to be as many ideas as people so to me that meant that no one knew what was going on, and for awhile I was content. 

I spent the next few years with a smug look on my face feeling like I had everything figured out which was ironic because being Agnostic means admitting that you have nothing figured out. It was quite nice not having that over arching feeling of eternal damnation looming over my head every time I did something deemed wrong in the Bible. I was still very much a good person who was nice to others and still got good grades in school. My code of conduct at the time (and still to this day) is to follow the golden rule and it’s worked great so far. 

Around high school graduation I started trending towards Atheism. I had taken a lot of science classes and suddenly the whole world started to make sense. Sure there was a lot we didn’t know, but just look at what we do know, the scientific method was not bias, it did not favor one idea over another it simply accepted the one with the most evidence behind it. The whole universe was an ever changing machine with near infinite complexity (complexity is simply ordered chaos and is only seen as complex through human eyes). I saw no heavenly hands tweaking or modifying this machine and further more I saw no reason why those hands were necessary. If the universe needed a creator then why did the creator not need one? I eventually settled on atheism knowing full well that there was no way I could prove my beliefs, but that’s exactly what they were: beliefs.

Until recently my belief in God has not changed, but just like a good piece of software there is always another level of abstraction that can be applied. I now realize that the existence of God solely depends on the definition of existence (and maybe God).  And thus we arrive at my current train of thought. 

Objects vs. Ideas
Now let me get this out here now: I see no reason why God needs to exist in order for the universe (humanity included) to function properly. Another thing I would like to clear up is the difference between an object and an idea. Most people would agree that God is not an object and would say he lies in another realm or dimension outside our own. There are many objects in existence though: trees, cars, iPods, etc… 

I like to think of an idea as a human unit of knowledge. Every single thing you have heard from someone, learned yourself, or told someone has been in the form of an idea. Without ideas we could not exist. Every piece of information you know or will ever know has the form of an idea, even an idea of an idea. The whole basis of human language is founded on the ability to spread ideas effectively. 

Now objects themselves do exist, but without an idea tied to them they are meaningless. An object that is an iPod exists and functions properly is completely useless to us without the idea of what it can and cannot do. So is the object more important or is the idea more important? I believe the latter is more important as we would be unable to recognize objects without an idea of what an object is in place. Ideas do not need tangible items attached to them either. There is no object attached to the idea of love and the idea of music is simply the patterned movements of air molecules, not the molecules themselves. 

The idea of God definitely exists; this we can all agree on. Is the idea alone enough to justify existence though? Whether God exists or not the idea of God has already changed countless people’s lives. One could go as far as to say that the idea of God has been more effective then God himself.  I believe ideas do exist; the human brain is essentially a container for all our ideas. Our multitude of finely tuned human senses provide the parameters that describe, shape, and form the ideas we hold today. 

We can all also agree that no two people (who have existed, currently exist, or will exist) are the same. This means that no two people will ever have exactly the same idea. You will not find two people who have ever existed or will exist that have the same idea of God. Every person’s idea of God is different, some may be extremely similar, but there are always differences as well. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that each person has their own idea of what God is and since ideas do exist within our own minds, God is contained within us. Since God is within us then God is us and if God is us then are we not God? We control God through our ever changing idea of him and he affects us through our idea of him. We are our own Gods and since every person has control over their own lives and actions then this seems like the ultimate truth all along.

Broseph!"" Said the Man with no hands. ""I just lost my eyes and needed you to help me out."" I inquired with the Question ""With what do you need enlightenment with?"" He befuddled, ""I just found a Magic Lamp and I am afraid of what I might see."" Noticing he has no eyes I decided to listen to the rest of his seemingly tall tale. . .And so he asked me what I would wish for if it was indeed a Genie inside his Lamp. Seeking out the perfect lie I decided to ask him out for tea. . . Eventually I relieved him of his anguish and told him the Perfect Wish, but not before I gave him all the riches in the world. I told the man, ""I would ask the Genii for a mountain of Trees."" The man asked me ""For what purpose would a man with no hand needs a mountain of trees?"" I responded with the next wish, ""My second wish is that all the trees on my mountain become 10 foot tall Ganga Trees."" The man apparently dumb-founded wanted to know the third wish. . .And so our dinner ended and the man's assistant came out of hiding and asked me is I wanted the Magical Lamp that he spoke of. I responded with my final wish, ""I wish that you would be free at the time of my death, but only if you smoke all my Ganga with me, by me, and still have enough raw Trees for a million Canvas Sails.""

And so the Genii Granted my first wish. . .I then asked the Man, ""If I get past the shadow of ""when"" then what is my next logical question given that ""how"" is not the answer I seek?

Then the Genii did not know and and so he proceeded to light up a perfectly rolled fatty.

Looking back knowing that the Man was in need I decided to ask him what it is he wanted. The Genii responded, ""A loyal friend."" I asked, ""Is that it?"" He replied, ""I could use some pussy from now and then."" And so the Genii granted my second wish.

Relizing now that this Genii is no man, I look to his assistant and ask him what he wants out of life. He quickly alluded to his boss' intelligence, ""A smarter man in my life.""

And so I wished for the Man's Genii to be free.

Realizing that I had let the Man's Genii trick the Man into setting him free I asked him for one quick favor before we go. He responded, ""Yes what is it mortal?"" I asked, ""Do you have a light?""


^.^

Fuck all you assholes that are getting your circle-jerking PHD(g00d)eed off in this subreddit. . .I mean if you are using my experiences to make more munny, then I guess, you are just Goofy. I love Kingdom Hearts.


The Moral of the Story is that if you want to be a Genii you better learn to start rubbing one off. Rubbing an oil lamp off that is LOL \o/

Oh also the Man ask the Genii for three simple wishes. ""I wish for the Wisdom of a Genii, I wish that you will help me fulfill my duties as a Man, And I wish that you were free the moment someone sets me free as a Genii for that is what I want to be."" And so those two clever Mother fuckers started the first /r/circleJerk.
